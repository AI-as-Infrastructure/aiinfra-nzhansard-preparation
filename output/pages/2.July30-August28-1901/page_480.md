It is now necessary to review the estimates of revenue, which I have set down at $5,839,000, together with £57,000 receipts to be derived from sale of debentures for sinking fund accre- tions. These two sums total to £5,896,000. Last year the actual receipts amounted to $5,905,506, showing that there is an estimated falling-off of revenue to the amount of $9,506 during this current year. I have no desire to be pessimistic, but one cannot be too cautious while framing the estimates for the year. It is only necessary to look around to see the solid evidence of prosperity which meets the eye; at the same time I have to bear in mind that extraordinary events took place : during the last financial year-events which undoubtedly had their effect in augmenting our revenue-events which are not likely to occur again, neither will others of a kindred character take their place : I allude to the visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York. The visit of their Royal Highnesses must have Mr. Seddon Differences. Estimato Actual for of 1901-2. 1900-1. Increase.

On the other hand, we must not lose sight of the effect of the remissions which were made in the tariff in August last. Had it not been for the increased consumption of dutiable goods which has been noticeable for i some years past, and for the extraordinary ex- penditure I have just referred to connected with the Royal visit, there would have been a loss of revenue to the extent of £130,000, and I must still reckon for a loss of Customs revenue in connection with the reduction of duty to the extent of at least $100,000 for the current year. Some portion of this loss will, how- ever, be made good by the increased consump. tion of articles not affected by the tariff alterations ; so I have set down the esti- mated Customs revenue at $2,110.000, or $70,862 less than last year's receipts. It may be that this curtailment of revenue will not take place, but it is best to err. if at all,
