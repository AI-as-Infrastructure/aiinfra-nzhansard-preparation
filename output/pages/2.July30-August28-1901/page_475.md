That is, between 1891 and 1896 there was an increase of 76,751, and between 1896 and 1901 an increase only of 69,385 (the Chatham and Kermadec Islands not included). OUR WORKING RAILWAYS. The rapid and continued growth of the busi- ness of our railways-the principal highways and means of communication between the various parts of the colony-is one of the best indications of the continued healthy and pro- sperous condition of the colony. The lines were taken over by the Government in January, 1895, and on the 31st March of that year the number of miles of line open for traffic was 1,993, and train-miles run 3,221,620. At the close of the last financial year, 31st March, 1901, the mileage open was 2,212, and the train-miles run 4,620,971. During the year ending 31st March, 1895, the railways carried 3,905,578 passengers, 28,623 season - ticket holders, 444,981 parcels, 750 carriages, 705 drays, 40,890 cattle, 1,519,921 sheep, 43,292 pigs, 36,972 tons of lime, chaff, et cetera, 85,102 tons firewood, 198,578 tons timber, 388,556 tons grain, 377,938 tons merchandise, 857,917 tons minerals ; earned a gross revenue of £1,150,851 ; and gave employment to 4,957 men. For the year ending 31st March, 1901, they carried 6,243,593 passengers, 82,921 season - ticket holders, 633,770 parcels, 1,336 carriages, 1,566 drays, 72,868 cattle, 2,412,191 sheep, 51,059 pigs, 78,844 tons chaff, lime, et cetera, 92,830 tons firewood, 380,803 tons timber, 772,571 tons grain, 551,879 tons merchandise, 1,366,241 tons minerals ; earned a gross revenue of £1,727,236 ; and gave employment to 7,793 men. Thus the traffic for the year ending 31st March, 1901, shows an increase over that for the year ending 31st March, 1895, of 1,399,351 train-miles, 2,338,015 passengers, 54,298 season tickets, 188,789 parcels, 586 carriages, 861 drays, 31,978 cattle, 892,270 sheep, 7,767 pigs, 1,291,296 tons of goods traffic of various classes, £576,385 in revenue, and 2,836 in the number of men employed. The actual profit, year ending 31st March, 1901 : £599,389, as against £571,533 for pre- vious year. Capital cost of railways open for traffic, £17,207,328. Profit on working gives £3 9s. 8d., as com- pared with £3 8s. 5d. for last year. Taking into consideration the large reduc- tions in passenger and other rates, the increased cost of materials, coal, iron, et cetera, and the increased wages, this result is eminently satis- factory, and the figures are, I venture to think, Increase. 1896. 1901. Numerical. Percentage. 390,571 49,940 14.66 362,236 381,661 19,425 5.36 252 272 20 3.97 69,385 7,366 : an eloquent testimony of the success of State administration of our railways. Notwithstanding the fact that the increased traffic during the past six years has been of such a phenomenal character, there is every indication that the business for the present financial year will be fully equal to that of the preceding year. # RAILWAY CONCESSIONS. In connection with results of working the railways for last financial year the large con- cessions in rates granted by the Government since resuming control of the lines should not be lost sight of, as they have a very material effect on the results for the year. The total reductions made since the Government took over the railways amounted, up to last year, to no less than £369,439, and to 31st March, 1901, to £420,239. The following are the principal concessions granted, and the estimated value of the reduc- tions for one year :- Reduction- Live-stock rates 25,000 Firewood, chaff, and lime 8,000 Free carriage of lime, butter, eggs, and fish empties 1,500 ..

Total of £165,000 In addition to the items enumerated, reduc- tions have from time to time been made on a very large number of articles of every-day use carried over the railways. The regulations have been made of a more liberal character than heretofore, train services improved, speeds increased, and additional trains, involving an expenditure of many tens of thousands per annum, have been provided ; and, to further meet the convenience of the public, goods and.
