177 farms were provided and about 170 work- men's homes.

The gross public debt on the 31st March, 1900, was £47,874,452; and on the 31st March, 1901, it was £49,591,245, or an increase of £1,716,793 for the year. The net public debt on the 31st March last was £48,557,751, showing £1,627,675 of net increase for the debt during the year. Analysing the above-stated increase, I find that, as I have before mentioned, £900,000 of new loan-money has been raised for the Public Works Fund, consisting of £700,000 under " The Aid to Public Works and Land Settle- ment Act, 1899," and #200,000 under the similar loan Act of last session. The require ments of the Advances to Settlers Office ne- cessitated our raising £380,000; and for the purchase of estates for close settlement we obtained £219,000. To enable grants to be made to local authorities £176,000 had to be borrowed, and further sums of £1,781 and $2,000 for dairy industries and the Govern- ment Accident Insurance respectively. £17,902 was deposited in New Zealand Consols, and $52,800, representing debentures for accretions of sinking funds, were disposed of, as also £18,000 of 3-per-cent. inscribed stock. On the other hand, £50,400 5-per-cent. debentures were paid off under "The Consolidated Loan Act, 1867," and $290 under "The Naval and Military Settlers' and Volunteers' Land Act, 1892." With respect to the interest upon nearly £800,000 of the moneys raised last year, it is right to mention that no burden will be im- posed upon the taxpayers, such interest being recouped according to the conditions under which the loans have been applied, so that these loans are virtually self-supporting. With regard to the balance, it is impossible to assist our settlers in developing our country without providing them with roads and bridges, and to provide for such expenditure it is essential that moneys shall be found out of loan. By the same means only can our railways system be extended, and effect be given to the wishes of honourable members and the people with regard to a vigorous prosecution towards the completion of our main lines. During the year £509,500 of debentures under "The Government Loans to Local Bodies Act, 1886," fell due, and were renewed under the provisions of "The Consolidated Stock Act, 1884." The Bank of New Zealand having paid $500,000, the value of its preferred shares, that amount was handed over to the Public Trustee, and by him invested in a like amount of deben- tures under "The Aid to Public Works and Land Settlement Act, 1899," held at the time by the Bank of New Zealand as security for advances made under the said loan. I observe that only two parcels of debentures will have to be provided for during the current year-namely, £250,000 under "The Aid to Public Works and Land Settlement Act, 1896," and £300,000 under the Land for Settlements Acts, 1894 and 1897. The former parcel is held by the Post Office, and can be renewed, and the latter was a London issue convertible into 3-per-cent. in- scribed stock. OUR RECENT $500,000 LOAN FLOTATION. Our financial advisers in London having re- ported unfavourably of the state of the money- market, and that a very low figure would be obtained for a 3-per-cent. loan, it was deter- I am pleased mined to tap our own resources. to say the result more than justified this action, as the recent flotation proved a complete success. The amount to be subscribed was $500,000, authorised by "The Aid to Public Works and Land Settlement Act, 1900." It was decided to make the issue at 4 per cent., with the price fixed at par. The loan was freely advertised throughout the colony, and also in Melbourne and Sydney. Tenders were opened on the 23rd April last, and it was found that the amount applied for was £861,800, represented by 126 tenders. The average price offered was £100 1s. 6d., the highest tender being at £102; and the lowest £100 Os. 6d. 112 tenders re- ceived allotment-62 over par, and 50 at par. The average price over par yielded £100 68. 7d. The allotment was made so as to embrace the largest number of small tenders and to en. courage bona fide investors. No less than 98 tenders have been accepted for sums of £5,000 and under-namely, 19 tenders for £200 and under, 9 from £200 to £400, 25 from £400 to £600, 5 from £600 to £800, 15 from £800 to £1,000, and 25 from £1,000 to £5,000. The remaining 14 tenders were in sums from £8,000 to £100,000. Australia received 29 allotments, in sums ranging from £200 to £50,000, and, with the exception of one tender, at premiums of from 1s. to 16s. over par.
