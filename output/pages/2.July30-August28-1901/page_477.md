The Post-Office Savings-Banks show a marked increase both in the volume of business and in the total amount at credit of depositors. Last year the excess of deposits (£4,170,428) over with- drawals (₺3,827,416) amounted to £343,012 over the previous year, and the interest credited to depositors to €146,169, while the total accumu- lated savings stood on the 31st December at $5,809,552, an average of £29 8s. 7d. to credit of each of the 197,408 depositors. Compared with the year ended 31st December, 1890, the increase is almost phenomenal, the total at credit having increased from £2,441,876 to £5,809,552, or at the rate of 137.91 per cent., Number of Accounts with Balances. £100 to £200.

Out of the statutory capitation of £3 15s. per annum on the average attendance, which is paid to the Boards of Education, these Boards have to pay teachers' salaries and allowances, the incidental expenses of School Committees, and their own office expenses, together with the cost of the inspection of schools ; receiving, however, an additional grant of £4,000 per annum towards this last item. The circum- stances of the various Boards are very different, and it is practically impossible for the Boards of the smaller districts, and even for the larger Boards (such as Auckland) in whose districts small schools are numerous, to pay salaries equal to those paid in districts in which there is a greater number of large schools.

The in- terest paid in 1900 was £146,169, as against £92,319 in 1890, an increase equal to 58.33 per cent. Classifying the accounts, it will be found that those with balances up to £100 increased from 90,115 to 178,405, or 97-97 per cent .; from £100 to $200, from 4,750 to 11,173, or 135-22 per cent .; from £200 to $300, from 1,502 to 5,151, or 242.94 per cent .; and above $300, from 841 to 2,679, or 218.54 per cent. The total number of accounts open increased from 97,208 to 197,408, or 103.08 per cent. Attached is a com- parative statement for the years 1890-1900- Above £300.

So many issues were in- volved that it seemed best to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the whole question. The report of the Commissioners contains two scales of staffs and salaries for public schools : the first, which involves an expenditure of £4 per head on the average attendance in all the public schools of the colony, is a vast improve- ment on the existing conditions. The second, which the Commission strongly recommends, is on the basis of $4 2s. 6d. per head ; it has the same general features as to staffing and salaries as the first, but the salaries are higher by about $5 all round, except in the smallest
