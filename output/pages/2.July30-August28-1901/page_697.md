reliance. Let us see now how far this has been carried out. During the year that has just expired the present Government raised in loan moneys ±1,749,000, made up thus :-- Loan - moneys raised during Financial Fear ended 31st March, 1901. For public works 900,000 .. 380,000 Advances to settlers .. Land for settlements 219,000 . . Loans to local bodies 176,000 .. Dairy industry 1,781 Accident insurance 2,000 .. Consols 17,900 .. · Sinking fund accretions 52,800 . . Total £1,749,481 . . And, Sir, nearly the whole of this money, excepting what has been taken out of the pockets of the people so far as the savings-bank deposits are concerned, has come from the English money-market; and at the present time this colony is absolutely dependent on the English money-market ; because, if circum- stances should happen so that New Zealand should, from any cause, or from various causes, be unable within the next six months to go on the English money-market and borrow large sums at less than 4 per cent., I tremble at what the position of this colony will be twelve months hence. Now, let us look at the public works expenditure, and how that is mounting up. The last year that the Atkinson Govern- ment were in power-that is, the year ending 31st March, 1891-$157,000 was spent in public works. John Ballance came into power in 1891 with a mandate from the colony, that he, by http://www.hathitrust.org/access use#cc-zero the public works expenditure, was to stem the tide of emigration which was going from New Zealand, and by which we were fast losing our population ; and he did it. How did he do it? He did it with an expenditure during the year ending 31st March, 1892, of $389,000. That was the amount that Mr. Ballance spent on public works during the year when he was Colonial Treasurer, and ending the 31st March, 1892. Then we go on, and honourable members will be interested in seeing what followed : For the first three years after Mr. Ballance died the expenditure was kept within reasonable bounds. It was in 1893 £472,000, in 1894 $409,000, in 1895 $359,000. And now watch how it grows : In the next year, 1897, it was $411,000, next year £427,000, next year $864,000, next year $916,000, next year #964,000, and last year the colony spent on public works £1,307,000. Finally, the Treasurer comes down with his Financial Statement and says the public works estimates this year are £1,950,000. And yet, as I have shown honourable members, the Hon. John Ballance, having received a mandate from the country, came in and saved New Zealand, and turned the tide of prosperity back to our shores, instead of from them, on a public works expenditure of $389,000. Now, I say that during the current year the Seddon Go- during the year ending 31st March, 1892. I would ask honourable members : do they realise -does the country realise - what an awful state of things is involved in this colony carrying on at this present time as it is with borrowed money ? For what would be our position at the present time if suddenly circumstances were to compel us to stop this drain of borrowed money, and return to the simple forms of Government which were initiated by Mr. Ballance, and which he said were absolutely necessary to be carried out if the colony was to be weaned from a servile dependence of the London market ? The follow- ing shows the public works expenditure from 1889 up to the present :- £ 1889-90 214,000 427,000 ¿ 1896-97 .. 1890-91 1897-98 157,000 864,000 .. 1891-92 916,000 389,000 1898-99 .. 1892-93 472,000 1899-1900 .. 964,000 .. 1893-94 409,000 1900-1901 .. 1,307,000 . . 1901-1902\* 359,000 1894-95 1,950,000 .. 1895-96 411,000 \* Estimated. I cannot help thinking that the Budget now before the House is not only a record for length and verbosity, but that it is also a record for humbug. It says that there should be "a jealously guarded expenditure," and that "the national expenditure should be cut down to the lowest limit consistent with efficiency." In the year ending the 31st March, 1891, the annual appropriations for departmental expenditure were $2,014,000 ; on the 31st March, 1895-the Government had been prudent up to that time ; they had held their hands, and the expenditure had only risen consistent with the necessities of the colony's finance and the bare expenditure necessary for the development of the colony- in 1895 the departmental expenditure had in- creased up to £2,189,000. Then I take a jump from 1895 to 1899-1900. In that year our expenditure rose to £2,854,000; in the follow- ing year it rose to €3,144,000, and during the present year the Government propose an ex- penditure of £3,329,000. These are the annual appropriations, and do not include old-age pensions. This short table indicates the growth of the departmental expenditure :- 1890-91 .. 2,014,000 1899-1900 .. 2,854,000 1,998,000 1891-92 1900-1901 .. 3,144,000 2,018,000 1892-93 1893-94 1901-1902\* 3,329,000 2,147,000 .. 2,189,000 1894-95 ' Estimated. I say that down to 1894 and 1895 a reasonable brake had been kept on the expenditure, but since then the colony has gone a "mucker," and we are approaching without any doubt that period in our history when there must be a roar for retrenchment, and when the necessities of our position will be so forced upon us that the colony will be absolutely compelled, whether we like it or not, to go in for such drastic re-
