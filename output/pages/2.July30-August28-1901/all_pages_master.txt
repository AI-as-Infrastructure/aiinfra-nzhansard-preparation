PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES.
=== Second Session of the fourteenth Parliament. LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. Tuesday, 30th July, 1901. Referendum Bill. The Hon. the SPEAKER took the chair at half- past two o'clock. PRAYERS. REFERENDUM BILL. ADJOURNED DEBATE. The Hon. Mr. TWOMEY .- Mr. Speaker, I did not intend to rise at so early a period in the debate to discuss this subject, and consequently, as it is a very important one, I have some hesi- tancy in speaking at the present moment. We all know that it is always a very serious matter to tamper with our Constitution. There is always great risk and great danger in doing so. For years past there are political terms which have been in the mouths of political women at women's conferences and others of that ilk, such as the elective Executive, the referendum, and the initiative, but have received no serious attention so far. With two of these we have nothing to do at present ; but the referendum comes to us now with the imprimatur of the Government on it, and, under these circum- stances, it is time, I think, that we began to look into it seriously, and ask ourselves what it means. We have the referendum at present in a limited form. We have it as regards the liquor question-a question that is referred to the people every three years. Then, we have it again in another form-as regards local loans. No local body can raise a loan with- out referring the question to the people. ] have taken some little trouble to go into the matter within the last few hours, and I find that the referendum is in operation in America in a restricted sense. It is chiefly used in the individual States, and not by the whole nation, and questions affecting changes in the Consti- tutions are the chief matters submitted to a referendum. Now, in America it is only right and proper that these questions affecting the VOL. CXVII .- 1.  Constitution should be referred to the people, for the reason that in these States the people are the source of sovereign power, and they delegate to the Parliaments of the States those powers ; and wherever any changes take place in the Constitution it is only right and proper for the people to exercise a vote in the matter. There are some other occasions in which the referendum has been used, and in most of these cases the Supreme Court of America, which always plays a great part in the legislation of that country, has declared it to be illegal. I find that the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio gave this decision :- "That the General Assembly cannot surrender any portion of the legislative authority with which it is invested, or authorise its exercise by any other person or body, is a proposition too clear for argument, and is denied by no one. The people in whom it resided have voluntarily relinquished its exercise, and have positively ordained that it shall be vested in the General Assembly. It can only be reclaimed by them, and by them by an amendment or abolition of the Constitution, for which they alone are competent." There are several of such decisions. Here is another from the State of New Jersey :- " Much as the authorities differ in their con- clusions, they all concur in the great principles by which the question is to be settled. It is conceded as indisputable,-(1.) That, as well by the theory of a representative democracy as by the expressed provisions of the Constitution of the States of the Union, legislation cannot be exercised directly by the people. (2.) That the legislative power cannot be delegated ; that it can be exercised only by the functionaries, and in the mode designated and prescribed by the Constitution. (3.) That a law enacted by any other mode than that prescribed by the Constitution is void." I have looked through several other deci- sions, and that is practically the opinion of the Supreme Court of America. But, I may be asked, what has this to do with us-what bear- ing has it on the question before the Council ? 
<page:26>
Constitutions under which the American States are working. There are two classes of Consti- tutions-the written and the unwritten. The British Constitution is unwritten. It has no restrictions. It is a growth built up from precedent to precedent, and consequently knows no power that can restrict its operations. Our Constitution is different. It is a written Con- stitution, and under it the Parliament of New Zealand alone has the power to make laws, and it has no power, according to the decision of the Judges of the Supreme Court of America, to delegate its powers to the people. This, perhaps, is not so important as the fact that we have now what is practically a referendum, in the people's representatives having to go before the constituencies every three years. I do not see that the principles contained in the present Bill would, under these circumstances, expedite matters. A measure must be twice rejected in both Houses-that is, it would take two years to refer it to the people ; and, under these cir- cumstances, I do not see how it could be re- ferred to the people much sooner than it is under the existing system. Now I come to Switzerland, the home of the referendum. I find it is a country divided into twenty-five cantons, with three thousand communes. Several of these cantons are so small as to have only thirteen thousand inhabitants, and these small communities are subdivided into smaller communities again, until there are three thousand communes ; and, even then, there are smaller bodies, called parish meet- ings and school districts. These small bodies have almost all the paraphernalia of govern- ment-their executive and all that-and for five hundred years these people have been trained in the exercise of the referendum, for in many of them every male citizen has a right to come and take a seat in the common council. So you see they have been educated up to this, and this makes a great difference as compared with people who have had no education in it. But after all this education the results are not what progressive people would deem satisfac- tory : Since 1875, when the national referendum was adopted, it has been exercised forty-one times, out of which the measures were accepted seventeen times and rejected twenty-four times, and a great authority on the question says that never yet has a measure been accepted by a majority. What happens is this : People who are indifferent neglect to vote, and consequently those who are rabid on the question vote, and carry or reject it. There have been tricks played in regard to it, for objectionable matters have been put into very popular measures, and these objectionable matters have passed under cover of the popular measure. As an instance of what they rejected, I might first say that there was a valley that wanted improvement. It was a splendid valley, and one to the advan- tage of the people to improve, but one set of people were pitted against the other, and conse- quently the measure was lost. This is what M. Deploige, in his great work on the subject, says about it :- Hon. Mr. Twomey to the canton. To improve a great valley, to protect it against periodical floods, to bring into cultivation some very important land at a relatively small cost, might have been ex- pected to meet the approval of all men. But politics interfered, and the Radicals voted to a man against the proposal. They very cleverly exploited the jealousy which the sotto (Genève felt towards the sopra Genève, for whose ad- vantage the improvement was undertaken. The result was the law was rejected, and the State Council resigned." An Hon. MEMBER. - What book are you reading from ? The Hon. Mr. TWOMEY .- Deploige's " Re- ferendum in Switzerland." Here was a matter of great importance, and because the politicians worked the oracle it was not carried. Here is another instance : A State bank was proposed, and it was rejected. And in most instances the progressive measures almost invariably have been rejected by the referendum. Here is what the author of this book says :- "I came back from Switzerland with a large memorandum-book cram full of notes taken here, there, and everywhere, just as I happened to meet my informants-professors, deputies, journalists, public servants, popular leaders, Catholics, socialists, and Radicals. In this curious collection violent abuse and enthu- siastic eulogies mingle on every page. The referendum is an excellent thing, an incom-  parable institution : you turn over a leaf and this wonder is suddenly termed a reactionary measure, a clog and a hindrance to progress." One of the people he consulted says, - "Those devoted to active politics are utili- tarians. With them it is a matter of calculat- ing the gains and advantages that their party or cause may hope to obtain from the referendum. It is not surprising, therefore, that the mem- bers of the Government and the majority should speak ill of the referendum, or that the chiefs of the Opposition should have no terms too flattering for it. The former owe nothing to the institution : quite the contrary." Thus the majority owed nothing to the in- stitution of the referendum, but quite the con- trary. Another extract says,- " All politicians do not regard the referendum in this light : there are some rare exceptions." Thus it will be seen from this that few poli- ticians favour it. Then, there is the outstand- ing fact : that in many cantons it has been restricted in its operation, and some will not have it at all. One of these is Fribourg. and here is what is said of it :- " Fribourg is the most curious of all. The cantonal referendum is one of the planks of the Radical party, and the Government and the majority will not have it at any price. It has been said, therefore, that Fribourg is not a democratic canton. If, on the other hand, the eagerness with which the electors go to the ballot-box on voting-days is any criterion of the intensity of the democratic opinion in that country, then Fribourg is one of the most de- mocratic in Switzerland." 
<page:27>
Another authority says, -- " As federalists we were in doubt in 1874 as to the result of the exclusion of the vote by can- tons. We were all labouring under a wrong impression that time, and we have been taught by experience that the Swiss people are more Conservative than their representatives." M. Carteret said,- " I should like to see the referendum com- pletely suppressed, and, above all, I want no compulsory referendum. As to the popular initiative, I dread it as a sort of legislative dynamite. In a word, the so-called rights of the people seem to me to be nothing more than democratic claptrap. In the hands of the clerical party they are only used to impede progress." M. Ernest Naville says,- " Only the very unsophisticated could believe that each citizen, after mature consideration, forms a decided opinion of his own on every law. In order that all the shepherds of the moun- tains, all the farmers of the valleys, and all the dwellers in the towns of Switzerland might have an intelligent personal opinion on the often very complicated laws, they would re- quire an amount of culture and leisure which is at present, and always will be, beyond the reach of the great majority of the population." " Be these your gods, oh Israel ?" These are a few of the facts collected by M. Deploige, who writes very impartially, and it will be seen that the Swiss people think very little of the refer- endum. Honourable members will see from this  that the tendency of this measure is Conser- vative, and for these reasons I think it would not be safe to allow it to pass without very grave, long, and serious thought. When the measure came down my first impulse was to vote for the second reading, and try to amend it in Com- mittee, so as to put it into a form that would make it of use and more to my liking ; but I do not think, under existing circumstances, any one would be very seriously hurt by putting it back for a time, with a view of giving it further consideration. It will be seen that in Switzer- land the people are used as tools by sects and parties, and consequently the measure never goes to the people unhampered by other con- siderations. Now, if that is the case in Switzer- land, where the system has been exercised for so many ages, what would it be if we introduce it here in our own system, and how would it work before the people are properly educated up to it ? We have at the present moment the freest Constitution on earth. We can do anything under it ; and my belief is that it would be a very dangerous thing to interfere with it too seriously. Coming now to the prac- tical part of it, I find, as I said before, that a measure must be rejected twice before it can be referred to the people, and consequently it will take all the time, or as long a time as it does now with the three-year period of election. I do not see, therefore, that there is anything to be gained by it, even in respect to expedit- ing legislation ; and I say, too, that it is impos- sible, as this authority points out also, for the general public to form a clear and in- telligent idea of some of the large measures that are frequently put before this Parliament. I, for myself, would have no objection to sub- mitting to the people abstract questions, such as Bible-reading in schools, and so on. That might be done with advantage, and it would relieve the representatives of the people of a great deal of anxiety and relieve the Government of a very irksome subject. But there is no provision in this Bill for this. There are only two condi- tions under which a question may be submitted. As it appears to me, it may be submitted if de- feated on the second reading ; and, second, if the Bill is amended. Now, I think where a measure is amended the amendments should be pointed out to the people, but there is no pro- vision in this Bill to do so. I see in the Bill also, in my opinion, a slur on the Legislative Council. There is here somewhere a provision by which a thing may be submitted to the people on a resolution of the House of Repre- sentatives ; and there is further provision where- by the House of Representatives may make the question a matter of urgency, and declare it to be a matter of urgency. Now, why should not the Legislative Council have equal powers with the House of Representatives ? There is also here a matter which I have heard discussed. I see the Premier in another place said that the Legislative Council could be abo- lished under this Bill. Well, Sir, whether that is desirable or not, I do not think it could. I have here the Constitution Act, where the posi- tion is stated. Section 32 says,- "There shall be within the Colony of New Zealand a General Assembly, to consist of the Governor, a Legislative Council, and a House of Representatives." The Legislative Council is part of the Con- stitution as well as the House of Represen- tatives. And by a subsequent clause it is enacted :- " It shall be lawful for the said General As- sembly of New Zealand, by any Act or Acts, from time to time to alter or suspend all the provisions of the said Act, except such as are hereinafter specified." And one of them is section 32, which I have just read. So that the Parliament of New Zealand combined has not the power to abo- lish the Legislative Council. Only the Imperial Parliament can do that, and it could not be abolished except by an Imperial statute. Now, Sir, I am sorry to have kept honourable gentle- men so long. I was not well prepared, as I ex- pected a great deal of discussion to go on before I spoke, and I hope honourable gentlemen will pardon me for having kept them so long. 1 now think that before this question should pass into law two things should be proved : The first thing that should be proved is that the present system is a failure, and that it has proved incapable of giving expression to the will of the people in legislative enactments. Can that be done ? I say No. The next thing that ought to be proved is that there are measures de- manded by the people which have not received the sanction of Parliament. That cannot he proved. I think that, bearing in mind all that 
<page:28>
the splendid progressive legislation which has passed these Houses of Parliament, and which has won the admiration of the world and drawn to us the attention of politicians everywhere, neither of these propositions could be proved, and that consequently there is no necessity for making a demand for such a reform as this. We have, as I said before, the freest Constitu- tion on earth. No republic could be freer than ourselves ; we can do anything we like under it ; and I think it is a great mistake for us to hamper that by such doubtful innovations as are proposed in this Bill. We have only to look back on the last few years and see how the political machine has been working. During the first period of the present Administration the Legislative Council kept in check the pro- gressive legislation until such times as the people had exercised the referendum by return- ing to Parliament those who were in favour of and were promoting that legislation. Then, when the Legislative Council found that these expressed the wish of the people at large it gave in handsomely and passed the legislation. I do not think, Sir, there is any great loss to be suf- fered by delaying matters of this sort. I think, from what I know, that the result of the delay in the past was that great improvements were made in the measures, and that in consequence of this they came to stay, and became acceptable to the people, and not only acceptable, but use- ful. It is under the present Constitution that all this splendid law has been passed. It is  under it that we are growing prosperous, and that we are attracting the attention of the world ; and, for my own part - and it is my honest advice to every one-I think we should  #cc-zero be careful before we tamper with a Constitution that has worked so admirably. The Hon. Mr. T. KELLY .-- Sir, I quite agree with the honourable gentleman who has just sat down that it is indeed a serious matter to make such a change in our Constitution as is proposed in this Bill. The honourable gentle- man has referred to the referendum in Switzer- land, and I need not further refer to its opera- tion there. I will deal with the referendum in the American States, in an English-speaking community like our own, from whom we may learn what the referendum properly means. Sir, in no part of the world that I know of is the referendum used by the General Govern- ment. It is not used by the General Govern- ment in Switzerland, but simply by the cantons, which are in the same position, I may say, as the provinces were in New Zealand before the abolition of provincial government. It is not used by the General Government in America : it is used by the States. What is the reason ? The reason is that in America the sove- reignty is vested in the people of the States, and each State has its own primary law, as it is called-that is, it is declared in the State Constitution that certain subjects cannot be dealt with by the Legislature without the consent of the people as declared by the re- forendum vote. That is the primary Con- stitution. The people themselves enforce on Hon. M. Twomey shall be, and that primary law cannot be altered without the consent of the people. That is a very different state of things from what is proposed in this Bill. Why have matters been so arranged in America ? The people have actually found from time to time that they cannot trust the Legislature with legislation for their benefit. The legislators were so often bought over by wealthy syndicates and com- panies to pass laws that were not in the interest of the public at large, but in the interests of these particular syndicates or companies, and it was therefore resolved by the people that the power should be taken out of the hands of the Legislature in various directions. That was mainly the cause of the referendum being so largely instituted in the United States. 1 will give a few of the instances of subjects that the American States Legislatures cannot deal with without the consent of the people. First of all, there is revenue and taxation. In pro- viding revenue and imposing taxation the Legislature is restricted. If they propose to exceed certain limits the question must be submitted to the people. In regard to educa- tion, the people by the primary law have indi- cated that the Legislature cannot touch educa- tion in the public schools in certain directions without first submitting the que-tion to them. 1 Then, with regard to the organization of Militia the power of the Legislature is limited. As for dealing with railways, the same steps must be taken. In that matter the powers of the Legislature are very much curtailed. It was found that the Legislature was giving away 1 the estate of the people, and giving privileges 1 in all directions, and therefore their powers were limited. The people also deal with such a matter as the fixing of the rate of interest. With regard to the fixing of the salaries of State officers, and officers of the public depart- ments. the people are also consulted. The establishment of banks and reformatories is also referred to the people in almost all the States. Defining the relations between hus- band and wife is also a matter that is dealt with by the people. They must also be con- sulted with regard to the law between debtor and creditor. The State also insists that if the Legislature wishes to fix the length of a day's work the people must be consulted by referendum. The people also have a voice in the length of the session. The primary law fixes the length of the session - the members are evidently paid according to the length of the session-and if the Legislature . wish to exceed the usual length , and therefore 1 exceed the expense allocated for the carrying-on of the work, the permission of the people must be given to any extension. The same principle is applied to the counties and the towns. They have their own Constitution. as we have in Now Zealand under the County Councils Act and the Municipal Corporations Act. It is truly astonishing to one to find the number of things that must be submitted to the people in these counties and towns. The power is limited in every direction. In fact, the Legislature is 
<page:29>
subjects unless they first submit the question to the people to give their voices on it. This Bill we now have before us does not propose anything of that sort. It does not propose to have any primary law or any constitutional law defining what subjects shall be referred to the people. In fact, the measure is one that should be called a Bill to settle differences be- tween the Houses of Parliament. It is not a primary Bill at all. Just lately I read what was said in another branch of the Legislature with regard to this Bill. I find the subject was dealt with in such a light manner that the debate oc- cupies only nine pages of Hansard. Now, what reasons were given for the Bill? The first is that a Bill called the Deceased Husband's Bro- ther Bill was rejected by the Council, and there- fore, it is said, it is necessary to bring in the referendum to settle that important matter. That measure has been dealt with, however, and is now out of the way ; it has become the law, having been assented to by the Home authorities. Another reason is that the Old-age Pensions Bill would have been passed at an earlier date. Well, my opinion is that if, in the first instance, that question had gone to the people it would have been rejected. There is another question mentioned - the sale of liquor in the King-country. Is that a ques- tion for a colonial referendum ? It may be a question under the liquor law, as licensing matters are generally dealt with, but a con- stitutional law cannot deal with it. Another reason was as to the question that is now per- plexing the people in regard to Bible-reading in schools, which, it is said, might be dealt with by the referendum. I think that to submit that question to the public vote would be most unwise. It would raise all sorts of rancour in the minds of the people, just as the liquor question now raises between prohibition people and temperance people throughout the colony. I know of instances of men refusing to do busi- ness with others who try to enforce prohi- Licion, and I am sure that if this question of Bible-reading in schools was referred to the people it would do more harm than good. Then, it was said the question of federating with Australia would be one to go to the people : but the answer to that is that, if both branches of the Legislature were so unwise as to pass a Federation Bill, a clause could be put in such Bill to refer it to the people for final decision. Another reason was that the single-tax could be referred to the people. Well, that could be done if both Houses agreed to put in a clause to that effect, without a general law. Then, in regard to the elective Executive, that might be dealt with in the same way. Then, there was the abolition of the Legislative Council ; but that could not be dealt with even by a Bill passed by both Houses; it would require an Imperial Act. Then, there is the Removal of Women's Disabilities Bill. An Hon. MEMBER. - What are they ? The Hon. Mr. T. KELLY .- I am sure I do not know. Probably they have some dis- abilities, just as men have; but they enjoy do not see any reason whatever for this Bill being passed, because it is not the referendum : it simply deals with disagreements between the two Houses. I think we have had an experience lately of methods of dealing with that question in the Commonwealth Bill. It deals with it in a direct way. It is ad- mirably drafted, and is a pattern to our Legislature with regard to drafting Bills in general ; it is concise in its clauses, and any one can understand it. The Act deals with two classes of Bills, one which proposes to alter the Commonwealth Constitution, and the other dealing with other Bills on which the Houses disagree. With regard to the first class, if there is an absolute majority of both Houses in favour of the proposed law it may be referred to the electors in each State, and if carried by a majority of electors and States it shall be presented to the Governor-General for the assent of the King. If the Houses disagree, and it is again passed by the approving House and again rejected, it may be submitted by the Governor- General to the electors. And there must be a majority, not only in each State but in all the States, before anything can be done. Another question arises : The question may be submitted by the Governor-General, and as we know he only acts on the advice of Ministers, it rests with the Ministry whether a proposal shall be submitted or not to the electors when the Houses disagree. In the Bill before us the taking of the re- ferendum is to be dealt with under our electoral law, and by regulations made by the Governor in Council. I think the matter is of too great im- portance to be so dealt with. We should follow the example of the Commonwealth Act, which provides that the vote shall be taken in such manner as Parliament prescribes. These are my chief objections to the Bill. It is not a Referendum Bill at all, and it does not comply with what is ordinarily known as a referendum ; it is simply to solve difficulties arising between the Council and the House, and that can be done in a much more simple and effective manner. The Hon. Mr. LOUISSON .- Sir, as a new member I feel some diffidence in addressing the Council on so important a question, and in the few remarks I have to offer I trust if I trangress in any way the rules or Standing Orders of the Council you will attribute it to my inexperience, and not to want of respect to yourself or my fellow-members. I regret very much that, on almost the first occasion I have to address the Council, I have to take excep- tion to a measure introduced by my honour- able friend the Minister of Education, because generally I have very great admiration for the legislation of that honourable gentleman and his colleagues. My serious objections to this Bill I will endeavour to state as shortly as possible. My principal objection to the Bill is that it is unnecessary and uncalled - for ; when I say "uncalled-for " I mean it is not demanded by any large body of the electors of the country. My own opinion is that 90 per cent. of the people generally do not care 
<page:30>
never considered it, take no interest in it, and care very little whether it is passed or not. I admit that there is a demand for the Bill, and a great deal has been spoken about it, and a great deal has been written about it, by a small but active section of the community who have probably Utopian ideas on the subject. We all know that there is in every country a certain section of people who have what we might term ideal ideas on legislation, and who think that if certain measures are enacted they will confer happiness and prosperity on their fellow-beings for evermore. But, Sir, I think that a great many measures proposed by this section of the community will be found. if carried, to be unworkable and unpractical. admit that the motives of that section of the community are of the very highest and purest description, but I think most of their ideas are theoretical, and that their ideas in practice will be found to be unworkable ; so that I think I may fairly say that the Bill is not demanded by any large number of electors in this country. And. when I say that it is unnecessary, I fail to find where the necessity has arisen for this Bill. The first part of the Bill deals with rejected Bills, and I would like to point out to honourable members that that part of the Bill is intended to prevent a measure being rejected three times, because honourable members will see that the Bill does not come into operation until after a Bill has been rejected twice. Consequently, it is only to prevent a Bill being rejected three times. Now, there are some honourable members pre- sont who have a much larger experience than I have of political matters, but I certainly cannot remember any occasion on which a Bill has been rejected three times by this Council ; and this measure proposes to prevent a Bill being rejected three times -- it is really providing a cure for some complaint which has never ex- isted. At any rate, that is my experience. The Hon. Mr. MeLean the other day, in speak- ing of this Bill, instanced the woman's suffrage Bill. Well, Sir, that is a case in point. I believe there was a very large demand for that Bill. or apparently there was a very large num- ber of people who wanted that Bill passed. It was passed by one branch of the Legislature, and when it came before this Council it was rejected. I think, Sir, if my memory serves me correctly, that in the interim there was a general election, and then also apparently there was a very great demand for the Bill. I believe a great many petitions were pre- sented to both Houses in favour of the Bill. Some of them were very long petitions, measuring miles, and requiring some very stalwart men to carry them into this House or the other Chamber. Well, Sir, what was the result ? On Parliament reassembling the Bill was passed again, and this Council, seeing, probably, that it was the general wish, or the wish of a very large proportion of the electors, that this Bill should be passed, bowed to public opinion as they understood it and passed the Bill. An Hon. MEMBER .- By one vote. Hon. Mr. Louisson friend says " By one vote." Probably it was ; but had it been rejected by one vote and brought up again at a later period it would probably have been passed by ten votes, which would have been better still, because it would have shown that the Council was educating itself on public matters. I think we can say that in New Zealand the people have the very greatest facilities for expressing their opinions on pub- lic matters ; and where do they express them more forcibly than they do in New Zealand ? And I think that their opinions are very much attended to by both branches of the Legislature. I do not think that this Council is likely at any time to place itself directly in I opposition to a public opinion very strongly expressed. I think the good - sense of this Council will always go in the direction of waiving their own opinions in favour of a very strongly expressed public opinion, providing there is nothing very exceptional in the matter at issue. So that, Sir, I really do not see that there is any necessity for the Bill. If at some time in the history of New Zealand some occa- sion had arisen where the Council or other branch of the Legislature had stood in oppo- sition the one to the other and had rejected a Bill several times, and a deadlock of some description had occurred, then, I say, it would have been very necessary to pass a Bill of this sort to prevent the recurrence of such a dead- lock ; but I think it is very well known that such a thing has never occurred, and therefore, seeing our present free institutions and the facilities we have for expressing public opinion, I do not think that any such thing is ever likely to arise, and, if the Bill is not necessary, I really think it would be bad policy to place it on the statute-book. I think we have a great many laws on our statute-book. Some of them are very good and excellent laws, but I do not think there is any great reason why we should place on that book any unnecessary laws. There is another danger I perceive in this Bill, and that is that a great number of people who would not be interested in any par- ticular question which was put to the referen- dum would not vote, and therefore there would probably be a very small vote, and a very small minority of the people might be the means of enacting something very much to the detriment of the large body of the community. Sir, there is no safeguard against that in the Bill, and I think if the Bill gets into Committee there should be some safeguard enacted in this direc- tion : that no decision arrived at under a re- ferendum should be valid unless a certain number of the electors of the colony record their votes. I think that it should be a very large proportion. I think that no question decided in that way should be valid unless a very large number of the electors vote on the subject. An Hon. MEMBER .- How many ? The Hon. Mr. LOUISSON .- Two-thirds, or something like that. There is another danger which, I think, might arise if there was a Referendum Act, and it is this: that the pre- 
<page:31>
sent easy and practical mode of arranging between the two branches of the Legislature when any difficulty occurs would probably not work so smoothly. At the present time, as I understand, if there are any amendments passed in a Bill which one branch of the Legislature objects to, there is generally a Conference ar- ranged, and, as a rule, things are amicably settled. But, to my mind, if there was a Referendum Act that arrangement would not so very frequently be carried out. Either House might be obstinate, and might say, " Oh, well, we shall not give way ; make it a rejected Bill, and let it go to the referendum." The consequence would be that wherever any difference of opinion occurred the Bill would Now, probably be sent to the referendum. Sir. I have been devoting my remarks so far to the first portion of the Bill. But when I turn to the second part of the Bill-namely, subsec- tions (2) and (3) of clause 4 - which set out what questions are to be referred to the vote of the people, I think it is even more objection- able. This clause provides for legislation not by Parliament, but by the people. Subsection (2) is as follows : " If a Bill passed by both Houses contains a provision that such Bill shall be re- served for the referendum." Now, what does that mean ? It means that the Bill is not a Bill as we enact it, but a proposition from Par- liament that such-and-such a thing may be done ; but it leaves it for the referendum to decide. Subsection (3) is even worse : it says, " If a resolution is passed by both Houses in favour of submitting to the referendum any legislative proposal (other than a Bill) set forth in such resolution." Now, what does that mean ? It means that whenever any difficult question comes up for Parliament to decide they will simply say, "We will not decide it ; we will let it go to the referendum." It seems to me that this is actually abrogating the powers and duties of Parliament. It seems to me to be. Sir, if I am not disrespectful in using the term, rather cowardly on the part of Parlia- ment, which is elected by the people. Because, Sir. I contend that both Houses are practically elected by the people. Although this House is nominative, still members are nominated by representatives elected by the people, so that to a certain extent both the Houses are elective. And it seems to me rather cowardly for a Parliament elected by the people and called together to legislate for the people to say when any difficult question comes before them, "We are not prepared to decide this ; we are not prepared to legislate on this question ; we shall leave it to the people to decide for themselves." It seems to me that this is an undignified position for Parlia- ment to take up. I think, Sir, if Parliament is worthy of the country it should be able to deal with any question that comes before it for the good of the people of New Zealand. I think, Sir, it is their proper duty, and if they cannot vote or enact what the great majority of the electors want, then, Sir, I think they should stand aside and make room for others who would do so. But I do think, Sir, this is ab- solutely handing over the very serious and responsible powers that are given to Parliament to the people. It would be simply a confession of inability to deal with those very subjects they are elected to deal with. Sir, there is an- other thing: If one branch of the Legislature had the Referendum Act hanging over it at all times it would result in this : They would either, as I said before, have to make nearly every Bill a rejected Bill or they would simply become a copying-machine. If this Council were bound either to pass the Bills enacted by the other branch of the Legislature or let them become rejected Bills, I say we would simply become a copying-machine of the other branch of the Legislature, and I do not think, Sir, that was ever intended. Former speakers have referred to Switzerland and to the state of things there, so that there is no need for me to go over that ground, except to say that the position of affairs there is very different from what they are in New Zealand. I understand that the refer- endum is in force in South Australia ; but I would ask honourable members how many times it has been put in force, because I do not remember, myself - I trust some member will correct me if I am wrong-but I do not re- member any case in which the South Australian Referendum Act has been put in force. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- Oh, yes. The Hon. Mr. LOUISSON .- Well, I did not know of the cases. However, we do not hear much about it. I think in South Australia they manage to settle their legislation between the two Houses pretty well as we do here. Now, Sir, I have travelled a great deal from time to time, and a little lately, and I must say that wherever the legislation of New Zea- land has been mentioned I have always heard it spoken of in terms of very high praise. In fact, I have been very proud to hear people in other countries speaking in the very high manner in which they do of New Zealand legislation, and I think, Sir, that is one of the chief reasons why we do not want the Referendum Bill. 1 think, Sir, if we had been enacting legislation which was inimical to the interests of the people of New Zealand, and which brought ridicule and contempt upon us from other nations, we would require some drastic enactment to pre- vent such legislation. But, Sir, our legislation has not only been beneficial to the inhabitants of this country, but also has gained us the high commendation of other countries, and is being admired and discussed in all its bearings in most countries at the present moment, and that, I think, is one of the strongest reasons why we should not wish to interfere with our present mode. Our present mode has proved ample up to the present time, and until some such dead- lock as I have described arises in New Zealand politics to call for such a drastic cure I think we should not pass this Bill. The Hon. Mr. SCOTLAND .- Sir, if any one had told me a few weeks back that a Referendum Bill would form part of the Government pro- gramme for this session I would have been tempted to say "Impossible." Of course, in 
<page:32>
common with others, I have heard a great deal talked for some years past of the referendum, but I could not believe it possible that any Government would have taken it up with any expectation that a Bill embodying the provisions of a referendum would have the slightest chance of passing this Parliament. When the honour- able gentleman who introduced the Bill stood up in his place the other day and said, or tried to say, all he could in its favour, I looked at him and said to myself, "I do not envy him." Sir, I thought I saw on the honourable gentle- man's countenance an expression as if he had been swallowing something very disagreeable, and I really cannot remember at this moment anything the honourable gentleman said which amounted to more than this : that he thought it ought to be referred to the people-that under certain circumstances, if the two Houses did not agree on a certain measure, the question ought to be put to the people whether such measure should or should not become law. That struck me as about the sum of all the honourable gentle- man said. Of course, Sir. I appreciate the diffi- culty he laboured under, and I very much doubt whether any honourable member of this Council in charge of such a Bill could have said more than he did on the subject. Of course, it was not his business to deal with the cons, but only with the pros. Sir, it certainly appears to me a most extraordinary thing, as one honourable gentleman has already pointed out, that if the two Houses-one elected directly by the people and the other indirectly - are unable to agree on a certain measure it should  be submitted to the people to say whether it should be adopted or not. Sir, the very name of referendum is strange to the majority of the people of New Zealand. I venture to say that more than 90 per cent. of the people would be inquiring of each other, " Referendum ! referen- dum ! What is the meaning of the word ? What sort of an animal is it ? I never heard of it before." I could not catch all the Hon. Mr. Twomey said about Switzerland, but I rather think he spoke somewhat disparagingly of the Swiss people, and of the success of the referendum there. Sir, there is no com- parison between the Swiss and ourselves. We are, no doubt, a greater people in some senses of the word ; but the Swiss are a very thoughtful and frugal people, and they expect a satisfactory account from their representa- tives of all the moneys expended in the public service. I cannot remember distinctly whether it prevails in every canton in Switzerland, I almost think it is general throughout Switzer- land, that no vote to the amount of 10,000 francs-$400 sterling-or upwards shall have the force of law until it has been submitted to the people. I sometimes wish there was a similar law in New Zealand. It would mean more control over our expenditure; but I am afraid it is hardly practicable. We are not like the Swiss. They are a frugal people, and we, I am sorry to say, are more like a race of gamblers and plungers of the neck-or-nothing style - reckless wasters of money. However, such as we are, we must make the best of our- Hon. Mr. Scotland selves. We cannot do impossibilities with the referendum, which, I am sure, would turn out a miserable failure. Could any one suppose for a moment that the people, in the event of a case being submitted to them for their consideration, would be allowed to judge of the matter quietly and by themselves ? Sir, it would not be the people but the Press who would decide whether a particular matter should become law or not. Yes, it would be the Press that would decide ; and possibly there would be some power behind the Press. All sorts of means would be resorted to to influence the people. Sir, the majority of the people are not fit to decide these questions for themselves which we are unable to decide for them. I will not go so far as to use the language of Carlyle, and say that they are mostly fools, but I will say that the majority of the people of this colony are not competent to decide abstract and difficult questions of law, or finance, or anything else. Sir, I listened with great plea- sure to what the Hon. Mr. Twomey said about the amount of liberty we enjoy in this colony. I heartily agree with all he said on that sub- ject, and I think that, considering we have representatives elected by the people, and that every member of this Council is supposed to individually represent the whole people, we should be content with the provisions of our \- - Constitution, and not call in a third party to decide anything for us. If the two Houses cannot agree about a Bill, what does common- sense point out ? That the measure should be dropped. " Who shall decide when doctors disagree," a certain poet inquires. Certainly if doctors disagree no sensible man would think of referring a question of medicine or anything else of a difficult nature to the first man they met in the street; and, since there can be no higher authority on political matters than Parliament, I think it would be the height of folly to refer any dispute which might arise between the two branches of the Legislature to the people-the hydra-headed monster, as the people have been termed. Sir, the opinion of the people is not always to be trusted. I have a certain amount of respect for the ror populi, but I can never forget the lines of Shakespeare, the greatest interpreter of nature, in which he sums up the average of mankind. He says,- 1 Who deserves greatness Deserves your hate ; He that depends Upon your favours swims with fins of lead And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye ? With every minute you do change a mind. And call him noble that was now your hate, Him vile that was your garland. I will say no more except this : I know that every Government has to meet Parliament with a certain box of what may be called figuratively fireworks. Some of these fireworks go up bril- liantly and make a fine display, others turn out to be mere squibs and crackers, and some hang fire altogether. This Bill appears to be one of the last-mentioned sort. I do not for a moment believe it was ever intended to be passed ; I trust it never will be passed, and I

ferondum upon the parliamentary stage. The Hon. Mr. ARKWRIGHT. - After the very able and exhaustive speech we have heard from the Hon. Mr. Louisson, I feel I cannot add much to the arguments brought against the Bill. But I think I ought not to give a stent vote, because I find myself in the same position as that honourable gentleman. I gene- rally approve of the measures brought in by the Goverment, and vote for them with pleasure. On this occasion I feel it my duty to vote against the second reading of the Bill. Whatever may be said for or against it, there is no doubt it introduces a most important constitutional change, and I never heard of a Bill which introduced a change of this kind being brought in in what I may call so perfunctory a manner. Before I can be induced to vote for a measure of this kind I must hear some much better arguments than I have heard either in this Council or by the right honourable gentle- man in another place. Anybody who did not know the state of affairs in New Zealand would unagine there was a constant state of friction between the two Houses, and that this Bill was a remedy that must be brought in to put an end to it. The honourable gentleman who introduced the Bill has not attempted to show that there is anything of the kind-in fact, he knows there is not ; there never has been, and it is not at all likely, under present circum- stances, to arise in future. I can imagine a state of things in which there might be con- sderable friction between the two Houses. If we had a Council elected by the people, as some of my honourable friends wish, I believe very serious difficulties would arise- - difficulties that could only be decided by some measure of this kind. But so long as the Council is consti- theed as at prosent there is no danger of any- thing of the sort. We know we cannot reject a measure on which the other House insists --- that is. we may show our disapproval of it by rejecting it once or twice ; but if they insist on the measure, especially if a general election intervenes and they still insist upon it, we know it is our duty to give way. The Council has always done so, and. I believe, always will have sufficient sonse to give way. Then, what is the necessity for such a Bill? Ir one speaks to honourable members or any one else who advocate the Bill, all they can say is. " Oh, you must trust the people." Well, of course, we do to a certain extent ; we trust th. m. as we must. to send proper representatives to Parliament. To that extent we trust them, and I suppose the proper thing to say is that the people fulfil the trust admirably. I sup- Jose we may take it that the honourable gentle- mon they send to represent them in another ! lace are the best they can find, and we may .- swine they never by any chance send a foolish person, or a windbag, or a drunkard, or anybody they ought not to send. But when it comes to trusting the people to exercise a vote on a Bill tiev have had very little opportunity of seeing, and still less of understanding . a Bill of many clauses perhaps, which may bear upon many VOL. CXVII .- 2. first sight-I do not think that is the sort of trust we can put in them. For instance, there is a Bill on the Order Paper called the Mortgages Bill. Suppose the Council thinks fit to reject it, what sort of vote would the people give on it if submitted to a referendum? Of course, I say nothing of the Bill; I know nothing about it. I believe it has the almost unanimous disapproval of the legal profession, and I suppose that is to a certain extent in its favour ; but I ask any man to say what sort of judgment would the people pass on it who have had no opportunity of seeing it, except, perhaps, stuck up in a post-office. I think this Bill ought not to be allowed to go into Committee, and I move. That it be read the second time this dan sir months. The Hon. Mr. REEVES. -- It is not my in- tention to vote for the amendment. I think we ought to have the Bill more fully discussed. So far as I am myself concerned, I must con- fess I am not inclined to vote for it at present, but I think the Council should have a little more time to consider the matter. The Bill is a very old friend. I have known it come up at different times for the last twenty odd years in another place, when I had the honour of being a member, under different foster-fathers. ] re- gret very much the Right Hon. the Premier has seen fit to put his name at the head of it, because I quite agree with most honourable gentlemen who have spoken that it is not re- quired. I was very pleased at the very lucid way in which the Hon. Mr. Louisson spoke about the Bill. He is a gentleman who has travelled a great deal and knows what he is talking about. Now. we have in New Zealand the freest Con- stitution in the world -- nothing could be freer : no referendum we could have enacted could give us greater freedom than we have at present. After looking in a cursory manner through this Bill, I can see well enough that if it were tried in law the cost to the colony would be some- thing enormous. It would be "a referendum here " and "a referendum there" ; every little place that liked to send in a requisition to have a referendum could have it, and as a general election costs a lot of money, the taking of a referendum would cost infinitely more. Therefore, on that ground alone, I think we should pause before passing this Bill. But. Sir, I do not think we require it. We are a people with government by the people and of the people : the other House is elected by the people, they go before the people every three years, and that is the best referendum you can possibly have. Another objection I have is that I think an important measure like this should not be brought ap just now. The time to bring up a measure like this is at a general election on the hustings, and I am quite con- tident in my own mind that the good-sens? of the people throughout New Zealand would scout the idea of a referendum. Switzerland has been instanced as a country where the principle of the referendum is in force, and also South Australia ; but both of these countries are very slow places. Switzerland particularly 
<page:34>
the world. They are satisfied with very small things there ; and the South Australian people are also satisfied with very small things. South Australia is a fine country, but it is the least progressive colony of all the Australian States. That we all know. At the same time, while making these remarks, I do not approve of the motion to put the Bill off for six months. think, as we have not got a very full Council to-day, it would be better simply to adjourn the debate for a day. An Hon. MEMBER .- That will simply be the means of killing it. The Hon. Mr. REEVES .- Well, if you want to kill it I cannot help it, but I certainly would give it a reprieve for a little time. The Hon. Mr. A. LEE SMITH .- I think this Bill would have had a much better chance of success had it itself been the subject of the principle which it seeks to enact- that is, had it gone through the process of obtaining from the people of New Zealand a vote at some general election as to whether they desired us to divest ourselves of our constitutional functions. Until that takes place I do not believe that this Council will pass such a measure. Sir, what is the leading feature of our parliamentary sys- tem? It is that the people of this and other British-governed countries look upon their representatives as having a position of supreme responsibility. If you take away that responsi- bility, in my opinion, you destroy the great value of your parliamentary institutions. If you pass this Bill, it would be the means of leading to a great deal of division and dis-  cord between the two Houses, and it would place legislation on an incomparably lower plane. We can foresee any number of Bills that might be brought in here, and which it might be con- venient for the Government or for either House to reject, simply for the purpose of getting rid of the responsibility of passing them ; and, in my opinion, such action would weaken our position as legislators. I think, Sir, also, that there might be many hurried decisions arrived at under the referendum. In this Legislature we might divide upon a Bill, refuse to pass it, and then refer it to the country, and the country in times of fickle excitement might pass some measure which would very likely be quite against the well-being of the country itself, and which might not have been approved of under normal conditions. Then, Sir, how have all great reforms been obtained ? Let us look at some of the celebrated reforms which have taken place in Great Britain. No doubt, in some cases there have been long and unfortunate delays before certain measures were passed, but in the long-run we have always succeeded in getting what we wanted ; and if we compare the legislative machinery here with that of Great Britain we see much difference. The House of Lords, by virtue of its Constitution, can go on almost as long as ever it likes refusing to pass a Bill, but in this country it is not so. An honourable gentle- man, in the course of this debate, showed that this Council must in the course of time, after Hon. Mr. Reeves sent up to it. But the House of Lords, on the contrary, has gone on in the past for many years refusing to pass legislation which has been through the Lower House. That has occurred within recent times; but here the Legislative Council adopts the views of the country, and. with the exception of delaying a Bill for I perhaps one or two sessions, it always passes it without much delay. So that I think there is no necessity for this Bill, and I am very sorry indeed to find the Government has brought it in. I do not agree with the Hon. Mr. Kelly that it is better to put the Bill into Committee and amend it there. I think the Hon. Mr. Arkwright's suggestion is the best-to kill it With our at once, and throw the Bill out. triennial Parliaments, our widely extended franchise, and a healthy public opinion in re- gard to all measures brought before us, this Parliament is powerful and effective enough to pass legislation which is in harmony with the desire of the people, and it only re- quires the intelligent guidance and direction of able public men. This you will always have. Why, then, should we put aside a system so full of historic renown in favour of one that would weaken the authority, and destroy the supremacy and prestige of an institution that for ages has been one of the greatest glories of our country ? The Hon. Mr. JENNINGS .- Sir, I have very little to say in reference to this Bill beyond this : that I intend to support the amendment moved by the Hon. Mr. Arkwright. I wish to point out to honourable members what would be the effect of clause 7. It reads :- "The day so appointed shall be not sooner than twenty-eight nor later than ninety days after the close of such session, and if between the dates hereinbefore mentioned there shall be a general election for members of the House of Representatives, then in such case the referendum poll shall be taken on such general election day." What is the position at the present time in regard to a general election ? There is a vote required for the election of members of Par- liament. There may be eight or ten candidates before the electors for a choice of three. There is also the question of voting on the issue of alcoholic licenses, when three points are sub- mitted for consideration by electors. This Bill would mean another or more issues placed before the people. I venture to say that even a great number of intelligent people would be confused as to the issues placed before them. If that is so, what must be the position of the non-intelligent voter ? Then, again, as has been said, there will be a very great expense incurred in this experiment. These reasons make me think the Bill should not pass in its present form. I do not think it is wise that the democratic spirit should be always on \-- its knees adoring the proletariat. While not afraid of the people or alarmed at their de- mands, I think this Bill has not been asked for. In fact, most people would like a little rest from statute - making. We have during the past 
<page:35>
looked upon with the greatest disfavour and suspicion by many people in this country ; and those measures which are asked for by the people have been passed in this Council. The legislation, which was experimental to a great extent, is spoken of in the highest terms all over the world. Sir, I again think that a measure such as this is not demanded by the country at all. If any such wish should be expressed, the Council, I believe, will be fully equal to recog- nising it. With the Hon. Mr. Scotland, I think the word "referendum" will be one of those choice expressions to roll about the tongue somewhat similar to that comfortable word " Mesopotamia," which gave so great a relief to that respected old dame mentioned in one of Dickens's novels. I shall support the amend- ment moved by the Hon. Mr. Arkwright, that the Bill be read this day six months. The Hon. Mr. RIGG .- Sir, I should be sorry to allow this measure to go to a vote without saying a word or two about it. I intend to support the amendment of the Hon. Mr. Arkwright. At the same time I disagree with the length of time given in his amendment- that is, six months. I think it would have been sufficient for the purpose I have in view if the honourable gentleman had moved that the Bill be read this day three months, and then we would have saved a certain amount of time. The honourable gentleman who represents the Government, in introducing the Bill, told us in all seriousness that it introduced a new prin- ciple. I think the honourable gentleman would have been much more correct and accurate had he said it contained a bit of a principle. That is where I have some fault to find with it, because when you speak to a person of ordinary intelligence regarding the referendum he under- stands at once that it is a great principle be- longing to a great country-great, at any rate, in this respect : that it is one of the purest and greatest of democracies in existence, and one also that has existed for many centuries. Therefore I regard the statement that this Bill introduces the principle of the referendum as known in Switzerland as an insult to that great democracy. Sir, the Hon. Mr. T. Kelly told us that the referendum was not applied by the Federal Parliament in Switzerland. Well, I think the honourable gentleman's memory is at fault in that respect. In Switzerland they have the optional referendum and also a compulsory referendum, and the compulsory referendum takes place when any matter affecting the Consti- tution of the country is dealt with. Such ques- tions must then be referred to the referendum. The optional referendum is brought into force sometimes on what is known as the initiative- that is, by a petition of fifty thousand voters and a majority of the cantons. But the most im- portant point in regard to the referendum is this : that laws, after having been passed by the Parliament, may be annulled by the vote of the people, and the people may demand a referendum in regard to them. So when we look at what "referendum " really means, and then compare it with the apology for a refer- time, it becomes difficult to identify it in any sense of the word as being a referendum. There are two clauses in the Bill which might be used under certain circumstances, and, I think, with- out any great danger. These are the clauses which provide that the two Houses may by resolution submit a question to the electors. Well, I can understand that before a resolution of that kind is passed by both Houses the ques- tion must have been very fully discussed, not only in Parliament but throughout the country, and the people would be educated enough in regard to the proposition to give an intelligent vote upon it. Therefore I think it might be possible to retain these clauses with advantage. It has been my fortune to have had an oppor- tunity of seeing a practical test of a modified referendum. It was introduced into the Typo- graphical Society of which I was a member, and all matters of importance were referred to the members for a direct vote. It was found in a very short time that the intelligence of the members of the union was not shown in the result of the voting-that in most cases the members voted without thorough knowledge of the merits or demerits of the question, and very often voted at the instigation of a person who opposed the proposal, and who did not take the trouble to enlighten them as to the true merits of the question they had to consider. Another thing we found was that, in many instances, where members had voted on a question of great importance to the union, and voted against the proposal, they would have been very glad after- wards if they could have had an opportunity of reversing their vote. Then, another matter which has been alluded to in taking theso votes is the question of expense. Well, it was found in the Typographical Society that that was another great disadvantage. We could not vote #1 to a charity without making use of the referendum, and the result was that it cost us $1 5s. to issue the voting-papers. Now, having seen it at work in a practical way amongst a body of men who are considered, amongst artisans at any rate, as those possess- ing the highest intelligence, and, seeing the dissatisfaction which existed in its working there, I cannot see how it would be possible to apply it to a great country like New Zealand, with its scattered population, with anything like advantage. or with any hope of obtaining the true intelligence of the people on any ques- tion. If we look at Switzerland we shall see there certain conditions which might make it possible to carry out the referendum satisfac- torily, but which do not obtain in New Zealand. Switzerland has an area of 16,000 square miles, and it has a population of about two hundred persons to the square mile. We have six times that area-that is, without counting our out- lying islands, we have over 100,000 square miles, and we have a population of eight per- sons to the square mile ; so honourable gentle- men can see that, where you have a population drawn together so closely and intimately as in Switzerland, it might be possible to put a question before them and get a satisfactory 
<page:36>
seittered population? It has been said that this Bill is a Bill intended to adjust disputes between the two Houses. Well, I regard it simply as a whip hung up to keep the Council in order. Lagree with those who said there is no nee \`ssity to adjust differences as between the Council and the other Chamber. We have a method of doing that at the present time. But I remember perfectly well a few years ago, and when a majority of the Council were somewhat obstructive and very much more stiff-necked than they have ever been since, that even in those days they always gave way to the verdict of the people when ascertained at the general elections. Had a measure such as this been brought forward at that time I might have been one who would have advocated it. But I can s' that conditions are so changed that there is now no necessity for the introduction of such a measure. I do not believe in changing simply for the sake of changa. Everything that is material changes, and changes are going on all the time; but before we change things we should consider as to what the ultimate result may be. I have noticed that the letters "S.P.Q.R.," which used to adorn the standards of the Roman legions, are now found gracing the front of a grocer's shop, and they signify " Small profits : Quick returns." I mention that simply as a change time may bring about; but I repeat that in making any change we should be very careful in considering our first steps with a view as to what the ultimate result may be. Had a good strong speech been made in favour of the Bill  it might have led to a debate worthy of the Council ; but, apart from the Minister, not a single honourable gentleman who has spoken h is said a word in favour of it. This naturally causes one to ask why such a measure is intro. dneed at all. If a measure which is supposed to have the importance of this one is brought before the Council, and out of the varied opinions that exist here on political ques- tions there is not a single person who will speak in favour of it, surely we may therefore assume that the same indifference and the sume want of regard for it must exist through- out the country. It is impossible that a question of this kind could have been dis- caissed and understood by the people of New Zealand without that opinion finding a reflex in this Council, and yet such is the fact. Sir. as I have already said. I intend to vote for the amendmont. I may say, further, that I look at a measure of this kind from the point of view of a party man. I admit, and I think we all recognis, that our political machinery is not perfect. It might even be cumbersome in some respect- : but so long as it is good enough for our purpo\~ why change it ? Machinery of this description is only a means to an end, and, if you can achieve your end with the machinery at your disposal. why change it moroly for the sake of changing it ? If we adopt a measure of this kind, we would next have the elective Executive, and I sty to all those who think like myself in regard Hon. Mr. Rigg tion of this kind until their opponents are in . power. Debate adjourned. The Council adjourned at thirty-five minutes past four o'clock p.m. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

On the motion of Mr. SEDDON (Premier), it was ordered, That Standing Order No. 211 be suspended, and that the names of Mr. Ar- nold. Mr. Fowlds, Mr. Gilfedder. Mr. Hardy, and Mr. J. W. Thomson be added to the Statutes Revision Committee. WATHI MINERS' DISPUTE. Mr. PALMER (Ohnemuri) asked the Pre- mier, If he is aware that the Waihi miners' dispute is still pending before the Arbitration Court, and that the company, it is alleged, have dismissed the witnesses who gave evidence for the union before the Conciliation Board, to- gether with 150 others of the Miners' Union. many of whom have left for Australia : and will 
<page:37>
Railway in hand at the Waihi end, so as to provide work and prevent many of our popu- lation leaving the colony ? In putting this question to the Premier he need not say much in support of it : it was plain, and explained itself. A number of people were going from the district, as they were unable to get work, and, as the Waihi-Paeroa Railway was now being pushed on, they might be em- ployed on the other end of it, and so kept in the country. The work had to be done, and the sooner it was done the sooner it would pay the Government. He would therefore urge on the Premier that. in order to stop these people from leaving the colony. this particular work should be started at the Waihi end and continued on. It was a pity the company had dismissed the men. They had no chance of going into the other mines, and, while many had had to go without work. others had had to leave the dis- trict and the colony. Some of the mines had to pay 437 10s. a day for coal because there was no railway to bring it to Waihi. This was crippling the mining industry. They had de- cided in this House that the railway was to be completed to Waihi, therefore why not put on enough men and complete it at once. The cost would be just the same, and the Government would get a quicker return for the money they had already spent and were spending upon the line. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said, If what the honourable member had stated was true no one regretted it more than he did -that the company had vented its feeling on those of its employés who had given evidence in the Court. Such action could only bring about a state of things that any employer would regret. That was his honest con- viction. At the same time, while the Government could not much further increase expenditure on public works, he would discuss the matter with the Minister for Public Works, and, if it was found that men could be employed with advantage at the Waihi end, they would probably be taken on to push the railway to a completion. Of course, it was the desire of the Government to meet difficulties of the kind as far as possible. If any attempt was made by employers or by employes to intimidate, he would be found taking the part of those who were intimidated. It seemed very wrong to punish men for giving evidence. He only hoped it was not true. At all events. the Government would do their best to keep the men in the colony. and. under authorised expenditure, to give them employ- ment. IMPORTATION OF SADDLERY. Mr. MONK (Waitemata) asked the Minister of Defence. Why the Government have im- ported saddlery from England, and whether the importation is being continued ? He was informed that the Government had imported saddlery for military purposes to a much larger extent than public requirements would warrant. and some of it, it was asserted, was being used for ordinary trade purposes. The Govern- ment professed a desire to help those who made the action of the Government in importing had diminished the means by which a large number of persons were fully employed. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said, in the first place, it was a moral impossibility for anything introduced by the Goverment in this way to find its way into ordinary trade. Secondly, he, as Defence Minister, although power had been given to import uniforms under the Defence Act. had been very careful, and had given the necessary certificate in very few cases. He had made up his mind that these would only be given in cases where the same could not with advantage be procured in the colony, as was the case in regard to certain officers' uniforms. As regards saddlery, he had made up his mind - after the way in which our own saddlers had come to the assistance of the Government in respect of saddlery for the contingents, and as our saddlery was, in his opinion, equal to much of the English-made saddlery-to do nothing to injure our trade, but, on the contrary, he would do his best to further it. PASSENGER STEAMERS BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) asked the Ge- vernment, If they will, at an early date, con- sider the advisability of purchasing or building three steamers of 10,000 tons, or thereabouts, to develop the passenger trade between New Zealand and Australia ? The question of pas- senger traffic between New Zealand and the Australian Continent was one of supreme im- portance, and it was generally considered that the passenger traffic could be largely developed by the introduction of passenger steamers of large size, and if the rates were made more reasonable than they were at present. It was well known that there were hundreds of people who declined to come to New Zealand owing to the poor class of vessels at present in the trade. One of the most prolific sources of wealth to this colony would be the tourist traffic. which might be made to do the same for New Zealand as it had for Switzerland. The question was now engaging the attention of Australian states- men, and a motion had been passed by the Federal Senate appointing a Committee to in- quire into the question of the Commonwealth undertaking the construction of large passenger steamers to ply between Australia and Tas- mania. He understood that the Premier had had some communication on this subject while in Australia with the Commonwealth authori- ties, but at that time they seemed to be indis- posed to consider the question of uniting with New Zealand in establishing a passenger service by means of large steamers ; but now that a ser- vice to Tasmania had been mooted the Common- wealth Government might co-operate with New Zealand in the direction he had indicated. He trusted the Premier would take the matter into serions consideration, and see whether something could not be done in the matter. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said this was a very large question, and a very important one. It was necessary that something should be done 
<page:38>
was by having an improved steam service. The matter was under the consideration of the Go- vernment, and he might say that for a long time he had not been able to see why the P. and O., the Orient, and other boats did not come down to New Zealand and make it their terminus and point of departure. Mr. HUTCHESON .- And bring their Lascar crews along with them. Mr. SEDDON said, Let them get the steamers here first ; and when they got them here he supposed the captains would prefer white men as their crews. LIQUOR-SELLING IN KING-COUNTRY. Mr. LAWRY (Parnell) asked the Govern- ment, If they will supply each member of the Legislature with fifty copies of the evidence and report presented to the House last session by the Public Petitions A to L Committee on the question of licensing the sale of alcoholie liquor in the King-country (Rohe-Potac) ? He might explain, in order to remove any misapprehen- sion that might otherwise exist in the minds of honourable members, that he referred to the evidence which was brought before the Com- mittee last session. Members would remember that last session the House was flooded with petitions on the question of licenses and no licenses in the so-called King-country. The Petitions Committee sat for two or three weeks investigating those petitions. The evidence was taken in shorthand, but, as far as he could as- certain, it had never been disseminated through the country, and he desired more particularly  that members should be able to send to their friends the concise, practical, logical evidence given before the Committee by one of the most able Natives in New Zealand-he referred to that highly educated, eloquent Maori gentle- man Mr. Ngata. He hoped the honourable gentleman's reply to the question would be in the affirmative. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said there were a few remaining copies of this evidence, and he would let the honourable member have fifty. If other members of the House required the balance they should let him know. It was a question whether it would pay to set up the type again and reprint the evidence, or whether after reprinting-if they did it-they would not have the matter on their hands. He would meet members' wishes as far as he could in regard to the matter. IMPERIAL TRADE ZOLLVEREIN. Mr. T. MACKENZIE (Waihomo) asked the Premier, Whether he has, in fulfilment of his promise of last session, opened communication with the Governments of the various colonies, and also with the Secretary of State for the Colonies in England, with a view to promoting an Imperial trade zollverein ; and, if so, will he kindly inform the House what measure of suc- cess and support has attended his efforts ? This was a question that the Premier very kindly last session promised to take in hand, and it Mr. Seddon man then approved of heartily, and he desired to know to what extent success had attended the honourable gentleman's efforts. They had evidence year after year that some system such as this within the British Empire must be established if we were relatively to obtain the benefits that should acerue within a great nation. In that morning's paper there was a report that the Germans had enormously increased the tariffs upon all agricultural products imported into Germany. On frozen meat and butter they had levied a duty of 30 marks by double hundredweight, and, as a mark was equal to nearly 1s., it meant 14s. 6d. per hundredweight on frozen mutton and butter. He did not emphasize that point with regard to  frozen mutton particularly, because at present Germany took very little of it ; but this fact indicated the trend of legislation amongst the leading Powers of the world. They were build- ing walls against British enterprise and pro- ductions on every hand, while the people of Great Britain were extending to foreigners the same concessions that they were extending to their colonies ; and he maintained that if some system of retaliation were established, Germany would be brought to its senses ; it could not then do without us, and would be forced to conclude a system of exchange of pro- duets which would be equitable and just. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said this was 11.0. a question surrounded with difficulty, and it was not because of these difficulties that no move had been made, but it was impossible to do anything in the direction indicated until we had the Commonwealth established. The Commonwealth was now established, and they were preparing their tariff; and it might be argued probably that in introducing the matter now he was looking to New Zealand with a view to obtaining reciprocity for our products if he advocated this national zollverein. He did not think the time was opportune, and we should allow things to get into place before moving in the direction indicated. Then, there was this: We would not gain anything, nor would the British manufacturers gain, so long as foreign Governments subsidised their steamers and gave facilities for getting their products to the colonies. So long as the foreign manufac- turers paid the remuneration they did to their employés as against the payments by British traders, the fact of altering our tariff would simply be acting against our own people, and would be of no benefit to the British manufac- turers. That was the conclusion he had arrived at. And we would have to arrange that when there was a demand for a certain class of articles they should be supplied. That was the first thing to be provided. At the present time British manufacturers could not give us the goods we wanted : and when they could supply them, they could not let the colonies have the goods within the time the same were required. That was the trouble. They admitted they could not do it. Mr. T. MACKENZIE said we could give them what they wanted. 
<page:39>
give us much. Then, the other question was as to the carriage of the goods. His own opinion was that the subsidies of the German boats by Germany, and the subsidies of the French boats by the French Government, practically handi- capped anything we could do in the way of a preferential tariff, and more than handicapped it. We had all that to deal with before we could bring about what the honourable gentle- man was aiming at. Then, again, by their last tariff the Home Government had put an impost upon colonial products. He did not see much feeling there in the direction of reciprocity on the part of the people at Home so far as colonial products were concerned. He thought if this question was raised at Home the answer would be that free-trade -- the open-door policy-was the policy for England. That was the position. Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- Have you written to them ? Mr. SEDDON said he did not care about writing ; he did not care about moving until there was a chance of success. Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- You promised last year to do so. Mr. SEDDON said he knew what he pro- mised ; and when he found the time opportune, and there was some chance of doing it without receiving a slap in the face, he would do so. But he did not believe in writing simply inorder to receive a slap in the face in reply. He be- lieved in watching his time. The time would come when this would have to be done, and the honourable member or whoever advocated this step and kept it prominently before the public would be doing a benefit to this colony and to the Empire. He hoped the honourable member would still agitate, and would still continue to agitate. ## WORKERS' COMPENSATION FOR ACCI- DENTS ACT. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) asked the Govern- ment, Whether they will this session introduce an amendment of the Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act, so as to make it quite clear as to whether or not the said Act applies to agricultural operations ? He was asking this question because a doubt had arisen as to whether the Act did or did not apply to agri- cultural operations. Of course, as members of the Legislature, they knew it was not intended to so apply it, because the proposal to insert the word "agriculture" was negatived ; but, seeing that there was a difference of opinion, he thought the Premier would agree with him that the matter ought to be made clear. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Labour) said, In his opinion, they were not intended to be in- cluded, but, while we were all very clear about what was intended when passing Acts, it was for others to interpret them. The interpreta- tion must be left to those administering the laws and to the Courts. He hoped the inter- pretation of the Courts would be in accordance with the wishes of Parliament. Mr. MASSEY said that was not the question he asked. He asked whether the Government point clear, as it was not clear at present, whether the Act did or did not apply to agri- cultural operations. Mr. SEDDON said, In the first place, the honourable member wanted the Act defined. It was unreasonable to ask him to bring in legislation to declare that the law was as he contended it was. He was not going to bring in a law when he believed it was not wanted. Mr. MASSEY .- Then, you refuse to do it. Mr. SEDDON said he had given the honour- able member an answer-that he did not think it necessary ; when necessary, that would be the time to do it. BICYCLES FOR CIVIL SERVICE. Mr. COLLINS (Christchurch City) asked the Premier, Whether, in providing bicycles for any branch of the Civil Service, the Government will in future give preference to cycles of New Zealand manufacture, and invite tenders in the daily papers at Christchurch, Dunedin, Wel- lington, and Auckland for the supply of same, thus encouraging this branch of industry and giving employment to New Zealand workmen ? Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said this question ought properly to have been addressed to the Postmaster-General, and, so far as that depart- ment was concerned, it was not deemed ad- visable to call for tenders for bicycles within the colony. It was stated by the Secretary :-- "Our experience has been that of bicycles said to have been manufactured in New Zea- land only a small portion of the work is done here, the parts being imported from other countries and put together. Generally, it may be said that a good machine, completely finished, can be imported by us at from 30 per cent. to 35 per cent. less than locally." If that was the case, and the bicycles cost 35 per cent. more, and it was simply a question of putting the parts together here, he did not think it would be fair to put that impost upon the colony. However, that was the depart- mental reply. MANGATORO ESTATE. Mr. O'MEARA (Pahiatua) asked the Pre- mier, When the Mangatoro Estate will be ready for selection ? He would also like to ask the Premier if it was the intention of the Government to acquire the eleven thousand acres at present owned by Natives and leased to the Assets Board ? He understood the Natives had offered this to the Govern- ment at a very reasonable price, and, as there were only two owners interested, and those owners already had plenty of land, he did not think the Government would be doing any injustice if they were to acquire this land from the Natives, in conjunction with the rest of the land, and have it cut up by the Government. The present statute did not ap- pear to debar the Government from acquiring this land, and, as the Natives were willing to sell to the Government, he hoped to receive a favourable reply, stating that the estate would be cut up and settled at once, and that the 
<page:40>
acquired, and cut up at the same time as the freehold. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said the question was, when would the Mangatoro Estate Le ready for selection ? That was the question, and the answer was that possession would be given on the 1st April, 1902, and the land would be put into the market carly in January next year. In respect to the other question, as to the lease- hold, he might say it would not do to tell what they were doing in respect to these matters; in fact, the law said they should not do so. Mr. O'MEARA said he might tell the Hon. the Premier that he already had information that the Assets Board intended cutting up this land, but he preferred the Government should do it, acquiring it from the Assets Board. Mr. SEDDON might say the matter had not been lost sight of. MACKENZIE AND DUNTROON RIFLES. Major STEWARD (Waimate) asked the Minister of Defence, Whether he will place on the estimates a vote to enable grants-in- aid to the Mackenzie Mounted Rifles and the Duntroon Rifles for the erection of drill-sheds at Fairlie and Duntroon ? There were com- panies of Volunteers at Fairlie and Duntroon -- in the one case mounted infantry, and in the other case a rifle company. These companies had not drill-sheds at the present time. At Fairlie there was a large building that could be converted into a drill-shed, and the local Volun- teers were willing to defray a considerable part of the cost, but wanted assistance from the Go-  vernment. With respect to Duntroon, there was no suitable building for the corps, but they had obtained a section of land upon which they would put up a building if they got the neces- sary assistance. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said no recommendations had been received as to the sheds mentioned, and he might say that usually grants on the basis of Al for 11 were given to companies which wished to ereet drill-sheds. That was the general rule, and if they were re- commended he would be most happy to look into the applications. Of course, every applica- tion must stand upon its own merits. There were some cases in which greater assistance was given than in others: it depended on the position of the corps. Major STEWARD said that, so far as the applications were concerned, they were sent in some time ago. He did not know whether the honourable gentleman had seen them or not. Mr. SEDDON could not say that be had. ## RIFLE CLUBS. Mr. HANAN (Invercargill) asked the Minister of Defence, If he will allow members of rifle clubs as at presented constituted to be enrolled. and the clubs accepted by the department ? He hoped this question would receive the serious consideration of the Premier, as it was a matter of great interest to many members of the House who had rifle clubs established in their di-triets. Mr. O' Meara follows : --- " Ex-Volunteers resident within a radius of five miles of the headquarters of a Volunteer corps, and having had not less than three years' service, or Volunteers after having served for three years in the Volunteer Force, will, on dis- charge from the Volunteer Force, be allowed to  enrol themselves in any recognised Government rifle club in the colony, provided no man so chi- rolled is less than thirty years of age." He felt certain the Premier recognised the splendid work that the rifle clubs of this colony had performed and were performing in the direction of training our young men to become proficient in the art of marksmanship. He might observe that many members of our rifle clubs were either under the age set forth in the regu- lation, or have not served the time required in the regulation for precedent Volunteer service. If this condition which he had read were insisted on, it meant that in many districts of the colony the rifle clubs would be reduced to mere skeletons, so far as membership was con- corned. It was well known that many mo- bers who were now shooting with rifle clubs had no time to devote themselves to Volunteering : in fact, the only time they had for devoting themselves to rifle-shooting was generally on 1 the half-holiday that was held during the week. He hoped this condition would be amended. ! otherwise many of our young men would be 1 compelled to disassociate themselves from our rifle clubs, which, he thought, would be a step that they must all deplore. It was highly necessary that all our young men should be good shots, so that if ever they were called upon to defend their hearths and homes they would prove themselves qualified for such de- fence. Furthermore, the best shots in the colony were to be found in rifle clubs, and many young men preferred joining these rifle 1 clubs because they recognised that they were more likely, by being members of such clabs, to improve themselves in marksmanship than \- by belonging to the Volunteers. In saying this he did not wish to disparage in the slightest the many great benefits which were ! derivable from active membership of Vohmteer corps. It might be said that some of our Volun- \- -- teers might be drawn away from the Volunteer corps to the riffe clubs. To that he replied that in our rifle clubs there were to be found many persons who were not only members of Voim- teer corps, but also were members of a ride club. He understood a number of one rifle clubs, if accepted as they were now coll- stituted, would be quite willing to be enrolled as a reserve corps. Having regard to all these facts, he hoped the Premier would give a favour- able answer to this question-that the rogi- lations would be amended so that the rifle 1 clubs as at present constituted might be en- rolled and accepted. So far as existing rifle club's were concerned, he would say, leave thon as they are, but with a proviso applying only to new members requiring three years' active Volunteer service, and the qualification of age 
<page:41>
hoped that these institutions, which had done so much good and were doing so much goed work. would have every assistance to continue, and not be wiped out of existence. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said there was no doubt the honourable member's question touched a most important matter. He agreed that the regulation referred to was perhays rather drastic, but it was framed with a view of preventing young men from forming themy lves into rifle clubs instead of joining some established Volunteer corps. But this did not affect anything outside the five mile limit from the Volunteer contre. It was only within the five-mile limit that the regula- tion obtained at all. He did not say that the distance might not be reduced : but he did not think it would be wise to have rifle clubs formed alongside Volunteer corps, as it would simply mean that there would be all rifle clubs and no Volunteer corps and no drill. However, he would look into the matter again, and see if he could with safety reduce the age and the mileage. Even under the existing conditions he had seventy or eighty applications for regis- tration as rifle clubs. Some of them had not given sufficient information, and that had kept them back ; but he had accepted a very large number the other day. Mr. HANAN asked if they would be accepted as constituted, provided other members would comply with the regulations. Mr. SEDDON said, If they were all rifle clubs and all new members joining, and if they had  previously existed as regular constituted rifle clubs. There was something in the contention, and he would look into it. ## LAW CONSOLIDATION. Mr. COLLINS (Christchurch City) asked the Government, Whether it is their intention to issue further volumes of consolidated statutes completing the work begun in the volume recently circulated amongst members, and, if so, at what interval such volumes will be issued ; also, do the Government intend to give legal effect to the work when completed, and, if so, by what means ? He, in common with other members, had the volume he referred to, and he was sure he was expressing the opinion of many honourable members when he said it was most desirable that such a work should be completed. It had always been a puzzle to him to get any- thing like a comprehensive grasp of our statute- law. The way in which fragments of law were scattered up and down our statute-books without any logical or legal connection rendered it impossible for any one to get anything like a comprehensive grasp. One might see there scattered fragments of law buried in masses of statutory matter which would puzzle one almost as much as the notable fly in the amber. One would wonder by what diabolical cunning they had got there at all. They were a puzzle both to the unwary and the wary. He wished to know if members were to regard this volume as a first instalment of a Bill to place the statutes in a less cumbersome form. the codification of the statutes had been done primarily by Mr. Jolliffe, and the draft which had been submitted to honourable members was to show what could be done, and, he might say also, what should be done. The Govern- ment had power to set up a Commission and to make a commencement with what had been submitted to members, and he hoped they would commence it next session. The Govern- ment intended to take active steps to get this matter done. He quite agreed with the honour- able member as to the necessity for this work. Mr. ATKINSON asked what sort of a Bill it would be. Mr. SEDDON said the Commission would decide that ; but he should say that the draft Bill which had been submitted to honourable members would practically be the Bill. The Commission would have to see that the statute- law was complete, and embodied in the Bill. They would have to classify the legislation, put it in systematic order, and bring it right up to date. ## SILVERSTREAM PUBLIC ROAD. Mr. FIELD (Otaki) asked the Minister of Defence, Whether he will give orders for the immediate removal of a fence erected some months ago by the Defence Department across a public road at the Silverstream, to the great inconvenience of a number of settlers, who have made repeated but fruitless requests to the Government for such removal ? Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said the Defence Department had had this matter care- fully gone into, and they were within their rights in what they had done. It was a ques- tion whether, when publie property had been acquired with public money for the Defence Department, the Defence Department were to be considered, or whether they were to consider the people outside. He did not wish to do anything which would interfere with the public convenience if it did not interfere with the defence work. At the same time, when they had paid $3,000 or #4,000 for land for defence purposes, he did not think they had any right to hand the same over to the public. Mr. FIELD said he would have amplified the question in the first place if he had not understood that the fence was being removed. Mr. SEDDON said he understood the ques- tion about the position of the gate. That he told the department to look into, and, as far as they could. adjust it, but not the fence. ## MIDLAND RAILWAY DEBENTURE- HOLDERS. Mr. GRAHAM (Nelson City) asked the Pre- mier, If it is the intention of the Government to give Parliament an opportunity during the present session of finally dealing with the sub- ject of the petitions presented to the House last session on behalf of the debenture-holders and shareholders of the Midland Railway Company ? He had placed this question on the Order Paper on behalf of many interested people, both within and without New Zealand. Two petitions on 
<page:42>
session and referred to the Public Accounts Committee; but that Committee, owing to want of time, was not able to deal exhaust- ively with the matter, with the result that they submitted only an interim report to the House. An exhaustive inquiry had, however, since been made, and the whole of the informa- tion obtained was now before the Government, the Parliament, and the country, and those in- terested desired to know what was the inten- tion of the Government in reference to it. He did not know whether the Government intended to refer the report of the Royal Com- mission to the Public Accounts Committee to deal with and report upon before the whole question was dealt with by the House, but he thought the Government should make some statement. In the interests of the colony and of all concerned, this important question should be settled definitely one way or another. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said all petitions not dealt with last session had to be dealt with by the Committee this session. Hon. MEMBERS .- Not all. Mr. SEDDON said that if the motion last vear only referred to the Native Affairs Com- mittee, he would like to have the advice of the Committee upon this matter, and he would therefore move later on that the petitions be referred to the Public Accounts Committee. Mr. GRAHAM said the Premier had been good enough to say that this matter was now referred to the Public Accounts Committee, but that the  honourable member did not appear to know it. He did not know whether that was intended as a reflection on him (Mr. Graham) as a member of the Public Accounts Committee. The matter had been referred to that Committee quite re- cently, and since notice of his question had been given. He might also explain that the Public Accounts Committee was convened to meet at the same hour on the same day as the Local Bills Committee, and he had explained to the Premier that it would be impossible for him to attend both Committees on that day, and he could not neglect the Local Bills Committee. He trusted, therefore, that the Premier did not mean to cast a reflection on him in what he had stated. Mr. SEDDON said he would be very sorry to reflect on any member of the House, more par- ticularly on the member for Nelson City. Mr. GRAHAM. -- Why more particularly the member for Nelson City ? Mr. SEDDON .- Because you are so circum- spect. Mr. GRAHAM. - That is a compliment from the Premier. Mr. SEDDON said he knew the honourable member did not get his notice, and subsequently arrangements were made for the notices to be given. He was under the impression that all petitions not dealt with last session were still before the Committees. This petition was not reported on last session by the Public Accounts Committee, and it would, of course, come before the Committee this year. Mr. Graham Mr. MEREDITH (Ashley) asked the Minister of Defence, When may the Kaikoura Mounted Rifles expect to be supplied with overcoats by the Defence Department ? Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said that tenders had been called for overcoats, and when tenders were accepted and the coats came to hand they would be distributed as quickly as possible. PUBLIC SERVANTS AND LOCAL BODIES. Mr. LAURENSON (Lyttelton) asked the Premier, Whether it is a fact that members of 1 the public service have been informed that they are not to be allowed for the future to hold seats on public bodies ; and, if so, under what regu- lation or Act has this been done ? This ques- tion pretty well explained itself. There was only one thing he would like to draw the Premier's attention to, and that was that, even if there had been a regulation under which these new regulations were issued instructing public ser- vants not to hold seats on public bodies, that regulation had been practically a dead-letter for many years past. He would like to know what had caused this new departure by the Govern- ment. There was another feature, and that was this : that the regulation only applied to Civil servants. Men employed on the railways were not classed as Civil servants, and yet at the same time these men were now being stopped from going on public bodies. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said that regulations for the Civil Service, gazetted in 1873, page 47, provided : " No officer shall accept or continue to hold the office of Mayor, President, Chairman, or member of the Council or Board of any pro- vince, county, city, town, borough, shire, or road district." Of course, this was one of those matters to which there were two sides. Still, occasions might arise where the duties of offi- cers on local bodies might clash with those of the Government departments in which they were engaged, and thus the officers might be placed in a false position. At all events, it was an old regulation, and the Government had been simply calling attention to it. He might say that it had not been strictly observed. However, there were several cases which had come under the notice of the Government. He did not think they should make the officers resign the positions to which they had been elected, but the Government did not think they should again take the positions so long as these regulations existed. Mr. HUTCHESON .- Does it apply to the Civil Service, or to the whole of the employés of the Government ? Mr. SEDDON thought the regulations could only apply to the Civil Service, because the re- gulations were under the Civil Service Act : so, of course, strictly it should only apply to those in the Civil Service. Mr. LAURENSON said the circular had been issued to men in the Railway Department, and that was his reason for asking the question. 
<page:43>
to the Civil Service, but he was informed that there was a decision of Cabinet that the regula- tion should apply to all Government servants. He was inclined to think that was what had been done. ## INEBRIATES' INSTITUTIONS. Major STEWARD (Waitaki) asked 11.30. the Premier, Whether the Govern- ment will this session place upon the estimates a sum sufficient to enable the establishment of one or more inebriates' institutions, so as to give practical effect to the statute passed in 1898 at the instance of the then member for Lyttel- ton. the late Mr. John Joyce? During the recess he had learnt that the Government had sent communications to hospital authorities asking them to make some arrangements for patients of this nature ; but that seemed to him to be only a temporary arrangement, and in no wise fulfilling the intention of Parliament when is passed the Act to enable the establishment of these inebriate institutions. What was neces. sary was that funds should be provided for the establishment of one or more such institutions, so that the Act might have a fair trial. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said the Govern- ment recognised the necessity for making pro- vision to meet such cases ; and, in addition to asking the hospital authorities to meet them, they had already taken other steps, with the view of meeting cases such as they frequently found in the Police Courts and gaols. An inter- mediate place was wanted, and after patients were able to leave the hospitals there ought to be permanent inebriates' homes to which they could go. The Government had already pur- chased a property in Otago, and a manager and matron had been appointed for it. It would be opened very shortly for patients. Last year's vote was only $5,000, but it was their intention to have an institution in each Island. He hoped to have one in the North Island very soon, and he could assure the honourable mem- ber that it was the Government's intention to give full effect to the Act. VOLUNTEER REGULATIONS. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) asked the Minister of Defence, When he proposes to have the necessary regulations published to provide, as ordered by resolution of Parliament, -il.) For the payment to Volunteers for day- light parades if one-half the nominal strength of a company be on parade ? (2.) For the pay- ment of capitation at the rate of $3 10s. per annum to garrison artillery and submarine miners? (3.) For the camps of instruction to be for seven complete days, and payment to be made to the Volunteers therefor ? (4.) For an increased annual allowance of ammunition for ride practice? In asking the question he would like to point out that an efficient Volunteer Force very largely depended upon those recom- mendations being carried out. They were made by the Defence Committee last session, and the Parliament adopted them. It was useless to have a large force on paper which was inefficient necessary that the Volunteers, especially the artillery, should drill by daylight, and the re- commendation of the Defence Committee on that point was unanimous. Parts 1 and 3 of the question had reference to this subject, and part 2 referred to the payment of capitation at the rate of 43 10s. per annum to garrison artil- lery and submarine miners. Those companies were doing very arduous work, and their uni- forms wore out much more quickly than those of others. It was therefore necessary that their capitation should be larger. He trusted that the Minister would see his way to give a favour- able reply to the question. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said, as regards the first and third parts of the question, no instructions had been given ; and, as regards the second part, he had informed the honour- able member that the matter would receive consideration during the session. Although they had got a recommendation from the Committee last session, no appropriation had been taken for increased capitation, and he did not intend to take any appropriation for it this year. for the simple reason that they would tid the Defence estimates so high, owing to the ab- normal condition of things, that if the matter was pressed too far the result would probably be a considerable curtailment by Parliament. Once they reached anything like a normal condition they might take up this ques- tion of an increase to these corps, which, as the honourable member stated, were en- titled to consideration on account of the extra expenditure they were called on for uniforms and in other directions. He thought, however, the matter should be held over for financial reasons ; it was a matter he would not forget. With respect to the third part of the ques- tion, he had to say it was now under considera- tion. As for the fourth part of the question, he wished to say it was not the recommendation of the Committee at all that there should be an in- creased annual allowance of ammunition, but the Commandant had since recommended that there should be an increase, and it was the wish of the Government to give effect to it. SUBMARINE-MINING BOAT. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) asked the Minister of Defence, If it is a fact that a new submarine-mining boat, for use in connection with the Auckland defences, has been ordered from Great Britain ; and, if so, what will be the cost ; and why the order was not given to an Auckland shipbuilder ? Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said the class of boat that was wanted could not be built in the colony at anything like the cost of the work done at Home, nor could it be completed within the time, and for those reasons it was decided to go to the Home-country with the work. Another advantage in sending the order Home was that the boat would be built under the supervision of those who were experts in such matters. It was not an ordinary boat, that was wanted at all. Inquiries were made on | the matter from the Admiralty, and on receipt 
<page:44>
to have the work done at Home. GARRISON ARTILLERY OFFICER. Mr. NAPIER ( Auckland City) asked the Minis- ter of Defence, If any steps have been taken by the Government to appoint a garrison artillery officer from the Imperial army to succeed Major Madocks on the staff of the Commandant ? He would like to point out to the Minister that, seeing the new Commandant was an infantry officer, it was essential that the gentleman who was to be appointed to succeed Major Madocks should be a garrison artillery officer, otherwise the expert knowledge of the garrison artillery officers of the colony would be seriously diminished. Captain Mackenzie, who had had charge of the Auckland forts, had left the colony ; and the gentlemen in charge of the other forts of the colony were men who had, no doubt. done excellent service in the colony, but at the same time they had not had opportunities for modern instruction in garrison artillery work. For the most part they were officers who had served in the Maori war -- men whose credentials were high, but who were not the most suitable for maintaining the most modern system of defence. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said the honourable gentleman would no doubt be pleased to learn that a garrison artillery officer had been appointed. Captain Moore was the officer who had been chosen, and he was about to leave London for the colony. There would be a further question as to whether or not the staff officer of the new Commandant should not also  be an artillery officer. It was his ( Mr. Sechion's) opinion that he should be ; but, of course, it was a matter for the Commandant himself to settle, and in a matter of the kind the Com- mandant would be left to judge. ## IMMIGRATION OF DOMESTIC SERVANTS. Mr. GUINNESS (Grey) asked the Colonial Treasurer, Whether the Government will make provision on the estimates to provide for assist- ance being given towards the immigration of girls suitable for domestic purposes ? He be- lieved it was admitted that there was a great dearth of girls in the market at present. It was caused, no doubt. by a very large number of girls entering the factories of the colony, and taking up other avocations. Mr. SEDDON (Colonial Treasurer) did not think it would be necessary to place any sum on the estimates for the purpose. When the fact reached Home that the colony had placed on its statute-book a law which allowed domestic servants a half-holiday weekly any amount of girls would come out to the colony without assistance from the Government. ## COMPENSATION TO TROOPERS FOR LOSS OF HORSES. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) asked the Govern- ment. Whether they will compensate for the loss of their animals those troopers belonging to the New Zealand contingents who supplied Mr. Seddon paign? A large number of members of the various contingents, especially of the Fourth Contingent, had supplied their own horses. At the time there was an idea prevalent that the horses would be returned to the colony, but it had been found it was not possible to bring them back. It was, he thought, too much to ask men who had risked their lives, and many of whom had suffered injury to their health, to suffer pecuniary loss also. He hoped, therefore. the Government would see their way to com- pensate these men for the loss of their horses. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said the position to- day must be gauged as it was when the men left the colony. In order to be taken at all many men had offered to take their own horses, and they were therefore given the preference. and he did not think it was right for them to expect compensation from the Government. Some of the men of the Contingents had made claims against the Imperial Government for the loss of their horses, and the New Zia- land Government had not stood in their way. At the same time he was not sure it was right, seeing that it was an inducement for the Government to take these men that they offered their own horses. Committees al-o had been finding horses, and it was a difficult point to determine. It was only where he knew there was a clear case that he had given his consent. He regretted the mon were not able to bring their horses back with them : and it was a decided hardship in several cases where officers' steeds had been with them through the whole campaign : but at the same time the danger from rinderpest was too great to allow of their being brought back to the colony. In cases where he was satisfied that the men did not understand they were going to lose their horses, or where their taking them had not been an inducement to the Government to accept their services, he would not object to compensation being given : but he did not pro- pose to take a vote of the House for the pur- pose. . ## MUNICIPAL MARKETS. Mr. HOGG (lasterton) asked the Govern- ment, If, in any amendment of the municipal laws that may be proposed, they will consider the desirability of requiring that in all muni- cipalities containing a defined population publie markets for the sale of farm, station, and dairy produce, fish. and other perishable articles, shall be established and maintained as neces- sary public conveniences ? While we were en- deavouring to expand our commerce abroad. the question arose whether we should not pay a little more attention to markets within the colony. The complaint of the producer for vears had been that both in the colony and outside it they were suffering from the opera- tions of the middieman, whose profits, they asserted, were considerably greater than those of the producer. It was well known that a great deal of fruit sold in Wellington and the other chief centres of population was not grown in New Zealand. He ventured 
<page:45>
fruit exposed for sale in Wellington was im- ported from the South Sea Islands, America, and other parts. That was not a proper state of things. One reason for it was the difficulty the producer found in reaching the consumer. Owing to the operations of the middleman. the grower of fruit, vegetables, and farm and station produce obtained a very poor return for his labour and enterprise. He had attended a meeting of farmers at Shannon, and was sur- mixed to be told that those who grew splendid vegetables could only realise about 6d. a bag for them. Canbages and cauliflowers were sent in splendid condition to the Wellington market. and the amount realised at auction was 2s. per bag : of that Is. 6d. went for carriage, for the value of the bag, and to the auctioneer, and all that the producer received was 6d., while the con- sumer had to pay from 5s. to 10s, for these articles. Then, if they considered ordinary frit, in his district, which was only about fifty or sixty miles from Wellington, all the producer wis able to get for good apples was from 1d. to 2d. per pound, while apples which were inferior to those he was able to purchase at that price direct from the producer were exposed for sale in Wellington in the windows of the Chinamen at Ad. per pound. That was a state of affairs that should not exist. With regard to meat, he ventured to say it would have been a great deal d-arer than it was in Wellington were it not for the operations of Mr. T. C. Williams and the Waingawa Butchery. This business, he be- lived, had been the means of keeping down the price and of checking a monopoly in the meat- market. which would otherwise have been most injurious to the consumers. If farmers had to rely on what the municipal bodies   would do for them they would not get much assistance. The resolutions of Borough Councils and municipal bodies with regard to markets were encrusted with the mould of ages, and he feared that not the slightest reliance could be placed on anything that would be done by these txlies. They might make good resolutions. out unfortunately those resolutions were never carried into effect. He wanted to see the Government adopt the same steps they had taken under the Slaughtering and Inspection Aer. and the Public Health Act. To secure public abattoirs it was found necessary to use the whip and spur of the State. If the markets he had referred to were public conveniences, and essential to the protection of the producer and the consumer, their creation should be mandatory. If the municipal bodies would not . tablish them, then the Government should undertake the work, and establish them at the cost of the municipalities. And if they could not abolish the middleman, they could, at all events, rezulate his profits, and the only way was by establishing public markets where the producer might meet the consumer face to face. and sell his products. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said, That there was a neces-itv for public markets in the colony they all admitted, and when they contrasted our position in that respect with the position of the to the advantage of Australia and to the disad- vantage of New Zealand. He believed that the one thing that would strike at the root of the Chinese greengrocery and fruit business would be the establishment of markets ; but that, of course, led up to another very important phase of the matter, and that was that, if they said the Government had to establish these markets, he did not see how they could build markets unless there was some one to put the stuff into them. Unless that was the case what was the good of your market? At present most of the vegetables were grown by the Chinese, and if they would not send their vegetables to the public market there would be no producers to supply them. Before you built markets you would have to find out whether you were going to get the produce, goods. or articles for sale to put into them. He knew that the consumers were suffering under the existing conditions, and he was quite prepared within reasonable limits to meet the difficulty as far as he could. When the Municipal Corporations Act was before the Committee, it was a pity it was not then moved that it should be the duty of a Municipality, where there was a population of more than ten thousand, to establish a public market. However, if any municipal legislation came forward this session an opportunity would be given to consider this proposal, and he would vote at any time, and under all conditions, to make it compulsory upon local bodies to provide public markets. ASHBURTON DRILL-SHED. Mr. MCLACHLAN (Ashburton) asked the Minister of Defence, If he will make pro- vision on the estimates for a grant to the Ashburton Volunteers for the enlargement of the drill-shed there ? Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said this case came under the ordinary category. When drill-sheds were erected, the Government sub- sidised them in some cases up to #1 for $1. He dealt with each case upon its merits. MORTGAGE-TAX. Mr. MONK (Waitemata) asked the Premier, If he will introduce legislation to harmonize the pressure of taxation upon incomes derived from mortgages on land and those obtained by other means, for instance : $4.000 lent on mortgage at the full rate of 44 per cent. supplies an in- come of 9180, and pays taxation of $16 13s. 4d., or 1s. 10\\d. in the pound on the interest re- ceived : while incomes derived from other sources up to $1.000 only pay 6d. in the pound ? He would remind the Premier of a promise made last session that he would afford relief in the special matter mentioned here- that was. a reduction of the mortgage-tax. He need not mention to the Premier, because he was sure he quite realised the fact, that it was really class legislation which charged those whose living depended on doles of interest, and who lent, money on mortgage at the rate of 43 per cent., lojd. in the pound on their income, while the ordinary income- tax was only 6d. in the 
<page:46>
further, he would just remind the Premier that it was a hardship also upon the settler and farmer who had to borrow money, because, naturally, the lender tried to recover as much as possible of this burden out of the borrower. He thought the Premier would admit that the average rate at which money was lent at the present time on good security was 44 per cent .; and 43 per cent. on a loan of $4,000 would bring in an income of £180, and upon that the lender had to pay to the Government 916 13s. 4d. in the shape of mortgage-tax. It was a very great hardship, and it was a hardship which he thought the Premier would admit was in- equitable. He hoped the Premier would see his way immediately to apply relief in accordance with the promise he made last session. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said, Members, of course, would well understand that "he who lives upon money-lending toils not, neither does he spin, but generally waxes rich." That was generally admitted. Of course, it was the duty of the State to see that taxation was equitable, and that it was paid by those best able to pay. That was the fundamental prin- ciple upon which they went. There had been lately, in consequence of the fall in the rate of interest that had taken place, a demand by those who lent money for a decrease in the tax. Mr. MONK .- Why do you lend money on land, and charge more than private indivi- duals who pay the mortgage-tax ? Mr. SEDDON said, Because the Government have no income-tax to pay, and gave the people who borrowed money from them the benefit of  that. He did say in the Financial Statement last session that they would this year bring down a proposal to reduce the mortgage-tax. It meant a loss of $25,000 a year. Since that   he found that his expenditure had gone up so much that he should have to reconsider whether he should bring down that proposal or not. If he did bring it down he should have to raise the money elsewhere, and that only meant another turn in the screw in regard to the graduated land-tax. At all events, this matter had been engaging the attention of the Govern- ment, and they wanted to do what was right. WELLINGTON-MANAWATU RAILWAY. Mr. FIELD (Otaki) asked the Government, Whether the offer made last year by the Wel- lington-Manawatu Railway Company for the sale of their line to the colony has been de- finitely refused, and whether there are any negotiations now in progress between the com- pany and the Government ? It was needless for him to say that this question was very im. portant, particularly to his own district and to the West Coast generally. He did not wish to take up the time of the House with any remarks, beyond simply saying that he was of opinion that it would be far better for the colony if this line was bought under "The Railways Construction and Land Act, 1881," and under the contract with the company, than under a contract such as was suggested last year. At the same time the Government should have the Mr. Monk last year ; but it seemed to him, after consider- ing the matter, that it was better to buy the line under the original Act. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said the honour- able member would, no doubt, have seen a reference in the public prints to the fact that the Government had declined to purchase on the terms submitted by the company. The Government had had a calculation made contrasting the proposed terms of purchase with the amount that it would probably cost the colony to purchase on the terms of the original contract, and had come to the conclusion that it would be advantageous for them rather to take it under the old contract as compared with the offer made : the only differ- ence in respect to which it would be an advan- tage being that if they bought the company out, land and everything, the company would disappear, and the Government fall into its place. He still thought that, at a reduced rate of interest, it would be better to take under a new contract. There was uncertainty in respect to assessing. Assessment had to be fixed by arbitration under the old contract, and his experience had always been that in arbitra- tion the (Government had always to go to the wall. He was very doubtful of relying upon arbitration where the terms of the contract were so ambiguous. An Hon. MEMBER .- It was all right in the Midland Company. Mr. SEDDON said that had been all right. and for that he was very thankful ; at the same time he might say, in answer to the question, that he thought some adjustment of differences 1 might take place under the new proposals. The fact was they were asking too much in asking 5 per cent. or 6 per cent. as the rate of interest from the commencement - knowing, as he did, that shares had been bought considerably below par. What they offered to sell at was : about $1 15s. A large number of these shares have been bought below par, and the pur- chasers thought to make money out of the colony ; but they would not make a rise out \-- of him if he could help it. It was necessary, as far as possible, to protect the interests of the colony. When the proper time came a report would be made, but in the meantime they were not prepared to pay anything like what the company asked. MICHAEL O'CONNOR. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) asked the Government, Whether they will favourably consider the claim of Michael O'Connor to the New Zealand Cross, in accordance with the favourable recommendation of the Waste Lands Committee, 1895, and also the favourable re- commendation of the Public Petitions MI to % Committee of last session ? He believed he was correct in saving that no Government had ever seriously considered the claim of Michael O'Con- nor to the New Zealand Cross. He would not like to say that the claim had not been fairly considered because Michael O'Connor was not fortunate enough to have the support of wealthy 
<page:47>
but he did think he was unfortunate in not having the support and advocacy of some per- son of earnestness and persistence. He did not propose to make a speech upon the subject, be- cause that was not allowed, nor was it neces- sary ; but he did propose to place on record one or two historie letters bearing upon the subject of Michael O'Connor's claims. The following letter had been written by Mr. Morpeth to Colonel Moule with reference to Victoria Cross pensioners, and which was attached to pension papers lying in the Native Office :- " COLONEL MOULE,- In Colonel McDonnell's letter of 15th July, 1868, recommending the defenders of Turuturu Mokai for the Victoria Cross, the names of the men were written on the margin, and among them were 'Stewart ' and . O'Connor.' According to these papers Stewart's claim to recognition appears to have been dropped, and O'Connor's admitted. Colonel MeDonnell might be able to afford some information as to the part, if any, Stewart took on the occasion referred to. " W. J. MORPETH. " 26th June, 1872." The reference to Lieut .- Colonel McDonnell produced this reply :- " Brougham Street, Wellington, 27th August, 1894. "The attack on Turuturu Mokai Redoubt took place on the morning of 12th July, 1868. Captain F. Ross was the only officer in com- mand. He was shot dead at the gate, and eleven other men were killed also. Some of the  garrison, panic-stricken, leaped over the para- pet and so deserted, amongst whom were Serjeant Burrowes, Corporal Cobb, and Private Kirshaw. The latter O'Connor fired at and wounded for deserting before the enemy. O'Connor was the bugler, and now took com- mand of the half-dozen men left, some of whom were wounded. O'Connor closed with and shot one of the enemy who had entered the redoubt ; but the redoubt was now in their possession, except one of the angles, where O'Connor and his few were. The Maoris now rushed the angle to dislodge them, but were met by the two Beamish brothers, one of whom fell ; the other was wounded, and Stevens and O'Connor, who had emptied all the chambers of his revolver, not having time to reload, used it as a club, and with it brained the leader of the charge, who fell back in the ditch dead. The enemy now re- treated with some of their dead and their wounded. O'Connor was severely wounded in the thigh by a builet. Had it not been for the great courage displayed by Michael O'Connor and his comrades the redoubt would have been taken and a large quantity of arms and ammu- nition and stores lost. " I recommended O'Connor and another for the New Zealand Cross for this affair. I sin- cerely hope Michael O'Connor's case will meet with most favourable consideration, and that for his verv meritorious conduct on the occasion referred to he will have the decoration of the New Zealand Cross bestowed on him, as Her Majesty the Queen instituted the order for special ser- ledge I have known of many brave deeds done during the late Maori war which have earned for the doers the Victoria Cross and the New Zealand Cross, but I know of no act that better deserves similar recognition than that per- formed by Michael O'Connor, late bugler to the Colonial Forces, and late H.M. 57th Regiment. "THOS. MCDONNELL, Lieut .- Colonel, N.Z. Militia." Another testimony to the bravery 12.0. of O'Connor was written by H. W. Brewer. staff-captain. Captain Brewer said,- " As far as I recollect, Milmore, Johnstone, McLean, Gill, and Bugler O'Connor got into two angles of the redoubt and defended them- selves desperately. Some of the wounded also assisted by firing at the enemy. Bugler O'Con- nor being an old soldier of the 57th Regiment, and practically in the position of a non-com- missioned officer, did capital service by re- peatedly sounding the 'assembly,' so that it was heard at the Waihi Redoubt, a little over two miles away. He also kept up the spirits of the men, and did good service against the enemy until the relief force, under the late Major Von Tempsky, arrived at the redoubt. The enemy, finding they could not get into the angles, commenced to undermine one of them from the outside, and about half an hour after the force arrived this portion fell into the ditch. " By his coolness and promptitude I consider Bugler O'Connor, who was wounded, materially assisted in saving the lives of the small portion of the garrison who were left after the others were killed and wounded. "H. W. BREWER, Staff-Captain." Then, there was this further testimony of Lieut .- Colonel McDonnell :- " Wellington, 24th January, 1890. "I hereby certify that Michael O'Connor, bugler, was discharged from the Colonial Forces in consequence of wounds received at Turu- "T. MCDONNELL, turu Mokai. Lieut .- Colonel, N.Z.M." Then, there was the report of the Waste Lands Committee, dated 9th August, 1895, conveying the result of their investigations into the claim of Michael O'Connor. They re- ported that the petition should be referred to the Government for their favourable considera- tion. The claim of O'Connor, as he had said, was submitted to the Public Petitions M to Z Committee last session, and the report of the Chairman of that Committee was as follows : - " I am directed to report that the Committee recommends the petition be referred to the Government for favourable consideration." That was the case so far as the public records went. The claim had been established beyond any cavil. The only question that remained to be considered, as it seemed to him, was whether the claim was put in too late-whether there had been such a lapse of time as to prevent the Government recommending the New Zealand Cross to be given to Michael O'Connor now. He said, as he had said at the beginning of his 
<page:48>
been some person willing to take up the case of | Messrs. Carroll and Wi Pere was about 965,000. O'Connor and prosecute it with earnestness and persistency at the time the incident occurred, | of idleness and incapacity on their part ; and or even at a later date, there would have been no difficulty whatever in securing the New Zealand Cross for Michael O'Connor. He now leit the case in the hands of the honourable gentleman. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said the application of Michael O'Connor for the New Zealand Cross was, with other survivors of the defence of the redoubt at Turuturu Mokai, investigated by Sir Donald McLean, and it was rejected on the grounds that, although the men behaved well, still they did not come within the terms of the Order in Council with reference to the New Zealand Cross. Since then Michael O'Connor had on several occa- sions petitioned the House and applied to the Government for the New Zealand Cross, but there had been no action taken, except that last year the Committee recommended the case for the favourable consideration of the Govern- ment. After the trouble in respect to the Wrigg case he was not very favourable to granting the New Zealand Cross, though in that case it was not applied for at the time, and was not refused. This was applied for at the time and was refused : and, after a lapse of years, was he (Mr. Seddon) to sit in judgment upon Sir Donald MeLean, who was acquainted with all the circumstances, and say he ought to have granted it. He was afraid that would not be very satisfactory. Taking into consideration the lapse of time and the effacement from the scene of all those who took part and could have borne testimony, it would not be wise at this stage to grant the New Zealand Cross. At all events, he did not think the Government would be justified in taking upon themselves the responsibility. The Committee had not said the Cross should be granted, but had simply referred the matter on to the Government for consideration. ## EAST COAST LAND SETTLEMENTS ESTATES. Mr. MONK (Waitemata) asked the Premier. Whether it is true that the Bank of New Zea- land, as mortgagee, is about to sell by auction. or otherwise, all those large blocks of land com- prising the East Coast Land Settlements Es. tates, and of which the Hon. James Carroll and Mr. Pere are trustees ; if so, what action. if any, do the Government intend to take? He had seen a paragraph in one of the Gisborne papers that the bank was about to sell a large area of land known as the East Coast Land Settlement Company's land. This matter had been gone into by a parliamentary Committee some few years ago, and he had then expressed the opinion that the best way to save a portion of the land for the Natives would be at once to dispose of as much as possible. The Natives. without a sixpence of consideration. intrusted Messrs. Rees and Pero with large areas of their lands, and the result had been phinging, sandering. and dissipation. The liability Mr. Fisher Now the liability was over $120,000, the result if the land were now put up to auction the Natives themselves would probably not receive one penny. What he wanted to know was whether the Government could devise any plan by which the Natives would be able to save even a trifle for their maintenance. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said the question raised by the honourable gentleman was a very important one. He thought the amount due to the Bank of New Zealand was now about 4120.000. The amount had accumulated, al- though very little had been spent upon the land itself. He thought a deputation went to Eng- land and a company was formed, and the result had been that the Maoris had been called upon to find for costs. expenses, and advances. a sum of about $120.000. The question arose as to what was the best to do with the land. If the Gio- vernment stepped in under the Land for Settle- ments Act and bought it at auction, that would The Maoris, of efface all the Maori claims. course, at the present time, as mortgagors, had a reversionary interest. That the bank was amply secured went without saying, because after pay- ing everything last year there was a balance left. At all events, there was a difficulty, he supposed, in all these Native land questions, and what had culminated in this action of the bank had probably been the action of the Validation Court in Gisborne. The House would probably ask what the Government proposed to do. He thought the best thing was to refer the matter to the Waste Lands Committee. There were two ways of dealing with it. The one was for the State to step in and relieve the bank and take up the position of the bank, place the runs under the Public Trustee, and, after disposing of sufficient to provide for what would be advanced by the Government for taking the land, the residue, or the earning of the residue, should go to the Native owners, who had a reversionary interest in the land. The other way was for the Government to take over the land, have it valued. pay off the bank, declare what part should be Crown lands sufficient to cover what the Government had paid the bank, and then place the balance of the land in trust for the Native owners. Those were the two ways of dealing with it. He was rather inclined to make it Crown land, and deal with it by the Land Board, which would be better than tying it up under the Public Trustee. He had thought. the matter over, and it seemed the best course was to remit it to the Waste Lands Committee 1 and let them advise. He thought it was keep- The bank at the ing back settlement now. present time was managing the estates, and the sooner they got rid of that kind of business the better for the bank. They were simply ad- ministering the estates as mortgagees; but. even with their administration, there was a considerable amount of profit. At the same time it was keeping back settlement on the East Coast, and he did not think it was fair to the Maoris, who would lose their interest in

was keeping large estates on the East Coast, while this gave an opportunity of bringing the land for sale under the Land for Settlements Act or under the Land Act. He thought it was a matter for reference to the Waste Lands Committee to advise, and to take steps later on to deal with it. ## CLOSE SETTLEMENT IN TUAPEKA DISTRICT. Mr. BENNET (Tuapeka) asked the Govern- ment, If they will acquire some of the large estates in the Tuapeka district, with the view of having them thrown open for close settlement ? This was a matter that had been before the Go- vernment on different occasions, but up to the present time practically nothing had been done. In the Tuapeka and surrounding districts there had been very little land made available for the people for settlement, and these estates that he had referred to in his question were most excellent land. He did not know any land that was better suited for settlement. There were a large number of young people about there, and if these estates were thrown open they would be taken up very rapidly. And there would be very little expenditure required in making roads, as the local bodies had already done a good deal in that direction. They had got the steamer running right up between these estates, taking the place in the meantime of the railway : so that everything was in favour of having these estates thrown open. He hoped the Premier would give a favourable answer to the question. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said the Govern- ment had this matter under consideration. The Land Purchase Inspector was down South now. The attention of the Government had been called to some estates, but he did not wish to particularise them, nor did he wish to say anything which might tend to make the owners in these localities ask for more money for their estates. If he did, the Government would have to pay too high a price. As long as the (iovern- ment were indifferent they found they could get the land at a reasonable price. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS. Mr. PALMER (Ohinemuri) asked the Go- vernment, Whether they will consider the ad- visability of printing on the corrected Order Paper the replies to questions that are to be put on Tuesdays and Fridays, or upon such other days upon which the Government do not intend to answer the questions orally, thereby preventing the accumulation of questions upon the Order Paper, and allowing members to get replies to their questions more expeditiously ? Perhaps Thursdays would suit as the day on which the answers to questions might be printed on the Order Paper. It would be better to have them answered on that day, rather than that they should remain unan- swered indefinitely. He might say that he had had to wait as long as three weeks for an answer to a question. He was sure members would be satisfied to have the answers printed on a particular day, rather than be kept waiting for VOL. CXVII .- 3. honourable members of their right to put the questions viva voce on other days except Thurs- days, and would insure the Order Paper being cleared up at least once a week ; and instead, therefore, of being a curtailment of members' privileges, it would, on the contrary, be an additional privilege for them. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said he did not see his way clear to give printed replies to ques- tions. It was really the only opportunity . members had of ventilating matters, and if they stopped members ventilating subjects in asking questions their remarks would be made at some other time-either by intercepting Supply or on some other occasion. He could not see his way to accede to the request. WOODVILLE REFRESHMENT-ROOM. Mr. O'MEARA (Pahiatua) asked the Govern- ment, When the papers in connection with the alleged Woodville refreshment-room Volunteer scandal will be laid on the table of this House ? Those who had made statements in connection with this matter had been inferentially accused of misrepresentation ; but he thought, for the credit of the Government and the honour of the Volunteer companies, the papers in the possession of the Premier should be laid on the table. An absolute denial had been made respecting these accusations. He telegraphed to the Premier what he considered truthful allegations, and he hoped the Premier would lay the papers on the table. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said he did intend to lay the papers on the table, and then an honourable member-he thought it was the member for Egmont- said he would only put one side of the matter, and therefore it would be an injustice to the other side. He (Mr. Seddon) had not been in a hurry, because, as he had said, a grave reflection had been cast on the Volunteer corps. He was satisfied that there had been misbehaviour-names were men- tioned in the papers ; at the same time it was worth considering whether or not the papers should be made public. Mr. O'MEARA .- Why not ? Mr. SEDDON said he would look into the matter. ## CORONATION OF HIS MAJESTY. Mr. MILLAR (Dunedin City) asked the Pre- mier, If he will, at an early date during this session, submit to this House the Government proposals as to the representation of the colony at the coronation of His Majesty in England, in June next ? Many rumours were going round as to what was going to be done with reference to the representation of the colony in the Old Country, and he thought it was only right that the House and the country should know what was going to be done in connection with the matter. He hoped they would not have re- peated what occurred on a former occasion- namely, haggling over the amount of money involved in sending representatives to the Old Country. The House being now in session, he thought the Government might well lay its pro- 
<page:50>
them as to the amount of money it was pro- posed to spend on that occasion. With the House the whole responsibility should rest, and he would therefore ask the Premier if he would give them an opportunity of discussing the whole matter at any carly date. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said he was rather pleased that the honourable member had put the question on the Order Paper, because he had noticed that under the heading of " Special Correspondent " some of the newspapers had gauged the situation exactly, and knew the intentions of the Government. They knew the views of the members upon the question, and everything had been fixed up. He might in- form them that the Government had no inten- tion of holding two sessions next year. It would be, if tried. a splendid opportunity for . holding the session at the end of the financial year, and finishing up the business about the beginning of May. Honourable members would then have from that time to October to prepare for the general elections, which would give them a splendid opportunity of educating their constituents. Mr. MONK .-- Why not have an early session every year ? Mr. SEDDON .- They would now be able to see how it would work. It had often been urged that the session should be held im- mediately after the close of the financial year. He hoped there would not be a repetition of what took place in connection with the former representation of the colony in the Old Country. He might not get an invitation to be present  at the coronation, and he might not be Premier then ; but, in any case, he would never again allow any one to be placed in a position similar to that in which he himself was placed in going to the Jubilee Celebration in 1897. He was not at all anxious to represent the colony ; he would personally prefer to remain at home and look after things. An Hon. MEMBER .- Is that sarcasm ? Mr. SEDDON. -- The honourable member would see by-and-by if it was sarcasm or not. Parliament ought to know the Government's intentions, and what the expenses were likely to be in connection with the representation. The necessary amount could then be voted before the session ended. The whole matter would be placed before the House for its con- sideration. It was just as well for honourable members to now know that he had no intention of having two sessions, and that he had no in- tention of being placed in the same position as he was the last time. "THE IMPRISONMENT FOR DEBT LIMITATION ACT, 1900." Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) asked the Premier, Whether he will this session introduce a Bill to amend " The Imprisonment for Debt Limitation Act, 1900 ?" The Act of last session had altogether failed of its purpose and design. It had proved to be a perfect hotch potch, and therefore was totally useless. The proviso to section 3 said this : - Mr. Millar shall be made where the judgment creditor is a person, firm, or company whose business is that of collecting or recovering debts, unless the Court is satisfied that the judgment debt was incurred to the judgment creditor directly, and was not acquired by assignment from the original creditor." But what was the use of the Act? The Commercial Agency, which was the particular agency or association aimed at by the Act, pro- ceeded on its course as gaily as ever, notwith- standing the existence of the Act. There was the usual Thursday parade in Court of poor persons who could not pay their debts. The Commercial Agency flaunted itself in the Courts of the city week after week, and, indeed, the Act might as well never have been passed. The clear intention of the proviso to section 3 was that a company whose business was that of col- lecting debts should have no power to appear as plaintiff to a suit, and section 6 of the Act said,- "The assignee of a debt shall not be entitled to maintain in any Court any action for the recovery of such debt unless he names the assignor in the plaint-note and summons." The assignor was named in the plaint-note and summons, as provided by the Act, but the whole object of the section was defeated by the newspapers, which left out the name of the assignor. and published only the name of the Commercial Agency Company as plaintiff. The form this section of the Act should have taken was this : Say he (Mr. Fisher) were manager of the company, the form should be "G. Fisher and the Commercial Agency versus R. J. Seddon." That transposes the names. Then the name of the assignor, as the original creditor, would have to appear first, and would consequently. have to appear in the newspapers. At present this section 6 was a dead-letter, as was the whole Act, by reason of the way the Act had been drawn and bungled, though he would not sav purposely bungled. This paper, issued by the Commercial Agency, which he held in his hand expressed the opinion of the Commercial Agency Company in regard to the Act. It was printed on pale-yellow paper with great red faring letters, which was sufficient to intimidate any timorous woman or timid man. This paper stated, with several very much displayed head- ings, that the company were - "Trade assignees, trade debt collectors. trade inquiry agents; agents in every town throughout the colony. " An alphabetical register of defaulters is kept for the use of subscribers. "The services of the company's solicitor in suing for debts are not charged for, and he will advise on all legal matters without any fees to subscribers. " Don't nurse your doubtful debts until thev are irrecoverable. Avail yourself of the com- pany's expert knowledge. "Send your accounts in for collection and get a cheque promptly. "HENRY WRIGHT, Manager." 
<page:51>
case was brought against himself in the Magis- trate's Court. in which he succeeded in nonsuit- ing the plaintiff. And now, three years later, the Commercial Agency Company, having heard of the debt, purchased it for a bagatelle and sued him through the Stipendiary Magistrate's Court. But again, through his legal ingenuity, he de- feated the company, and put it in for $20 costs, so that he did not think the agency would bother him any more. The company, not content with punishing the poor of the city, had taken upon itself to express its opinion of the Act of last session, and had circulated that opinion through- out the city. It said this :- " Since the Legislature has provided the fullest temptation to fraud by the virtual abolition of the judgment summons, without substituting any procedure for the protection of creditors, the law of New Zealand has ceased to be a deterrent to dishonest debtors." Fancy that coming from a person like Mr. Henry Wright-" dishonest debtors !" He (Mr. Fisher) wondered what Mr. Wright would call himself. It was further stated,- " And it is now quite easy for any person, even with an income of €5,000 per annum, to defy his creditors and still preserve a legally untarnished reputation. This being so, the expert assistance of a reliable trade protection agency becomes more than ever indispensable as the only means of recovering doubtful trade debts." What was wanted was what was represented to the Right Hon. the Premier last year- namely, an Act to prevent trading companies, such as the Commercial Agency Company, from fleecing the poor of the city, because it was only the poor who were attacked by the greedy and grasping hawk who managed this company. If the honourable gentleman were sincere and honest in his desire to protect the poor of the city-indeed, the poor of the whole colony-he would bring in such a measure as he was asked last year to bring in. Instead, however, he had brought in the Act of 1900, which was to all in- tents and purposes a dead-letter. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said he 12.30. would give the honourable gentleman an opportunity to try his hand at it and see how far he would get. It was as much as he (Mr. Seddon) could do to get the Bill through at all last session ; it took him all his time, and he had had some experience in getting Bills through It was not so complete as he would like it, but he would defy any one to get a Bill through that would not have some defects. He thought the statement of this Mr. Wright on the back of the poster was enough to show that he, at any rate, did not like the Act. The Government had had to put up with a great deal of abuse of a similar kind-that they had been passing legislation to encourage dishonesty. But, in his opinion, it was impossible to put a stop to it until you removed the machinery. He could never see why the State should keep on paying Magistrates high salaries to sit and If that were hear these kind of disputes. the evil, and the sooner that was done the better. REMOVAL OF LICENSES. Mr. ATKINSON (Wellington City) asked the Premier, Whether, in view of the unanimous decision of the full Bench of the Supreme Court that the prohibition of the removal of licenses supposed to be contained in section 22, sub- section (4), of "The Alcoholic Liquors Sale Control Act Amendment Act, 1895," can be evaded by dropping an existing license and applying for a new license at any other place in the same licensing district, the Go- vernment will introduce a Bill to make such prohibition effective ? The subsection referred to was necessitated by the enlargement of the licensing districts by the Act of 1893, which under the old lawas to removal allowed licenses a range of fifty or even a hundred miles in the enlarged districts. The removal of a license in the Otaki district from Manakan to Levin called the attention of Parliament to the danger ; and the subsection was inserted in the Act of 1895 which purported to prohibit removals for a greater distance than a quarter of a mile. The decision of the Supreme Court in the New Ply- mouth case a fortnight ago rendered this part of the Act waste paper. To remove a license more than a quarter of a mile was still illegal ; but precisely the same result could be obtained by a very simple evasion. The process adopted now was this : Assuming a man had a license at A and wanted to get it transferred to B, fifty miles away, he put in an application for a renewal at A and an application for a new license at B, and when both came before the Committee he let A stand over and got a new license for B, and then allowed the A application. to lapse. The decision of the Supreme Court was that this procedure was good at law, though in substance and in effect it was nothing but the removal of a license. The procedure was adopted in the New Plymouth case to remove a license three or four miles, and across the boundary of a borough - a double violation of the expressed intention of the Legislature. In the Rangitikei district two such removals were allowed at the annual licensing meeting last month : Taihape was given two licenses, one license being dropped at Ohingaiti, and another at Colyton - the removal in the latter case being for more than fifty miles. He would point out that really the position was worse under the present procedure than it was under the old procedure with regard to removals. In the Wellington Suburbs district the Com- mittee had refused to renew a license at Kai- warra, but now any other no-license centre in that district, such as Khandallah. Wadestown. or Karori, was exposed to the peril of getting a license, not withstanding the unanimous decision of the people of those centres that the license was not required. They were now simply at the mercy of the Licensing Committee. The position under the present law was worse than. under the old one, because then there was no necessity for the publican to jeopardize his 
<page:52>
the removal failed the old license still remained good ; but now he had to imperil his old license before he could secure the new one, and it meant that he must come to an improper understanding with the Licensing Committee on the quiet before he would imperil his license. In this respect he would suggest to the Premier that the provisions of this clause made the position with regard to removals worse than it was before, and some alteration was necessary if the licensing legislation of 1895 was to be given proper effect to. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) quite admitted that there was an evasion of the intention of the Legislature in passing the Act preventing the removal of licenses, and it implied that, though they might be as careful as they liked in their legislation, means would be found to evade the law. He admitted that the manner of doing it now was much more objectionable than when, as formerly, a license could be re- moved a limited distance. Now a license could be removed for any distance as long as it was in the same electoral district. But this question opened up the whole scope of licensing legislation. On the one hand there were objections to any amendment of the licens- ing regulations, and on the other hand he was asked to pass a clause remedying present de- fects. You could not do the two things ; but he thought that if it were only for the pur- pose of dealing with these two questions-the stopping of the granting of new licenses by the dropping-out of old ones, and the giving of  the Magistrates power in regard to the indorse- ment of licenses-a Licensing Bill this session was necessary. If, however, he introduced a Licensing Bill remedying defects of a technical character, how far could he go before much larger questions would be introduced ? At all events, it would be his duty to endeavour to remedy as far as he could defects which now existed, and the Government had taken cog- nisance of the evasion of the law in respect to the dropping of licenses and the taking of them up again at another place ; and he had set his face against this, because he believed it to be an evasion of the law, and he did not think it was right. However, he thought. if the other busi- ness made satisfactory progress, they would have a Licensing Act Amendment Bill this session, and if members were moderate and would simply deal with what the Bill proposed they might get something through ; but a great deal would depend upon members themselves. BONUS FOR PRESERVED MILK. Mr. PIRANI ( Palmerston) asked the Colonial .Treasurer, Whether he is aware that the con- ditions attached to the bonus for preserved milk limit the award of such bonus to one firm, and whether he will alter those conditions so as to allow open competition for the bonus? He would like to point out to the Premier that on the 17th June last regulations for granting this bonns were made by Order in Council, and they were gazetted on the 20th June. There was a bonus promised of 3d. in the pound up to $1,000 Mr. Atkinson preserved milk. The period prescribed for the production of the milk was to date from the 1st July following the Gazette-that was, ten days after the bonus was gazetted-so that any manufacturer who wanted to start a factory and participate in the bonus had only ten days in which to make all his preparations and start the manufacture of the milk. At present there were two factories in the colony, owned, he un- derstood, by one man-one in Auckland and  the other in Invercargill. He noticed from the statistics that in 1897 they exported 47,484 lb. of preserved milk : in 1808, 493.6561b. ; in 1899, 643,559 1b. : and last year, 560,508 1b. It was estimated that nearly the same amount was sold by the same factories for local con- sumption ; so that actually there was last year manufactured in the colony nearly sufficient te earn the bonus by this one manufacturer alone. Now, his point was that the conditions of the bonus absolutely precluded anybody but this one manufacturer from obtaining the bonus. He thought if the Government intended to grant a bonus of this sort, as well as the rebate of the full amount of the duty paid on the sugar used in the manufacture, they ought to open the bonus to everybody who wished to go into this industry, and not preclude everybody but this one manufacturer. By allowing only ten days to elapse from the declaration of the bonus to the commencing of the manufacture the bonus was practically limited to the fac- tories already in existence. He therefore asked the Premier whether the Government were aware of that fact ; and, also, if they were aware of it, would they extend the time for the commencement of the period to earn the bonus, say, to six months, so that anybody who desired to start a manufactory for pre- served milk and earn the bonus would have a chance to do so ? Mr. SEDDON (Premier) might say it came  to him as a surprise that only one factory was likely to avail itself of this bonus. It certainly  was not the intention of the Government that should obtain. The first recommendation from the department was that the Government should only pay a bonus on the milk exported, but that was stopped for very good reasons. But what was really wanted was a bonus in order to en- courage the manufacture of preserved milk, and \- - to promote the establishment of factories. The point raised by the honourable member as to the short time between the notice and the claim for the bonus was such as to warrant the Govern- ment reconsidering the matter, and that would be done ; and so far as he could he would make the bonus open to all who wished to avail them- selves of it. DISTRESS FOR RENT BILL. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) asked the Premier, Whether he will this session intro- duce a Bill to amend the law relating to dis- He could not better express tress for rent ? what he had to say on this subject than by reading the few remarks he made on the same subject in this House last year, namely :- 
<page:53>
Government, Whether they will this session propose an alteration of the law to limit the power of levying distress for debt where the household goods of a person so levied upon may be proved to be worth not more than, say, $10? This question was really not so clearly expressed as he himself might wish it to be. But it was difficult to express in words. The object was that. where distress was levied, the house goods -or household gods - of a person should not be seized by the bailiff. As had been pointed out to him by two or three gentlemen of the legal profession, the Magistrates' Courts Act of 1893 (section 125) already exempted ' the personal and family clothing, the bed-clothes, bedding, and tools or implements of trade,' not exceeding in all $25 in value. The articles specifically mentioned might not be worth 55 or $6, but the bailiff, under the law, rust seize everything not specifically mentioned ; so that the $25 exemption was misleading, and was a myth. The bailiff, as stated, was restricted from seizing the personal clothing of a man, the bed- clothes, the bed he slept on, his blankets, his mattress, his bedstead, and his set of tools, but the rest of his household gods was swept away. Every stick of furniture and the pots and pans must be seized. The object of the question, then, as the House would see, was to amend the law in that respect. He had it on the testimony of Mr. Gordon, the bailiff of the Wellington Stipendiary Magistrate's Court- who, in addition to being a most exemplary and efficient officer, was a man of humane feeling - that, notwithstanding this clause in the Magistrates' Courts Act exempting to the value of $25, he was bound to seize anything and everything beyond the articles specified in section 125 of the Act. He therefore asked the Government to alter the law so that the fur- niture and the small belongings of a house might not be seized by a merciless bailiff, and the persons levied upon literally turned into the street." Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said he would not repeat the reply he had given last session, but would say he was still convinced that there was a necessity for an amendment of the law, and would give effect to what was intended under an amendment of the Magistrates' Courts Act. He did not himself think it was ever intended, or that it should happen, that people should be thrown out into the street without anything at all. He would bring in a Bill to deal with the question. ## PAYMENT OF MEMBERS. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) asked the Premier, Whether he will this session intro- duce a Payment of Members Bill? Again he would read a few words he had uttered in the House last session as bearing on this sub- ject :- "Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) .- I did not speak during the debate on the second reading of this Bill for the reason that in speaking upon the Governor's Salary and Allowances Bill I said all that I wished to say in regard to both ject which during the discussion of both Bills has been kept steadily in the background. Now, I am not one of those members who organized an opposition to the proposals of the Ministry. I am a loyal supporter of the Go- vernment. The branch of the subject that has not been brought to the front is the amount of . salary or honorarium paid to members, and on that subject I hold a very distinct opinion, which I will make very plain. It was said that to have made any proposal to the House on that subject during the present session would have been to take the country by sur- prise. It was also suggested that, in order that the country should not be taken by surprise, members of the House should broach the matter to their constituencies during the recess. That was, without doubt, a prudent course for the Government to suggest; but I have an opinion of my own on the point, which is this: that now is the time, and this House is the place, in which to broach the sub- ject to the constituencies ; not with a view to include the proposal in either of the Bills im- mediately before us, but with the view to the introduction of a measure in the next session. In the last Parliament I gave it as my opinion that there should be an increase in the salaries and in the number of Ministers; and I now speak in advance of a step which I hope to see taken during the next session-namely, that the honorarium or salary paid to members shall be increased to $300 a year. It is futile for members of this House, or any member of the public, to cavil at my opinions on this sub- ject or to cast imputations at me. I give at once and without doubt my clear and emphatic opinion upon the subject. I think a member of the Parliament of New Zealand is entitled to at least the salary paid to members of the Par- liaments of Australia-Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. We are equal in legisla- tive standing to the Parliament of any one of these colonies." He hoped the honourable gentleman would make good his promise to introduce the Bill. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said there had been an indication of something of this kind, he thought, in the Speech from the Throne, and there was every probability that later on this session a measure bearing on the question would be introduced. WELLINGTON HARBOUR BOARD. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) asked the Premier, Whether the Government will intro- duce a short Bill this session to afford redress to those persons resident in the City of Welling- ton whose land was compulsorily taken by the Wellington Harbour Board ? This case, he knew, was familiar to the honourable gentleman. He (Mr. Fisher) had brought the matter before the House during the last session of the last Parlia- ment, when Mr. Joyce, the honourable member for Lyttelton, brought up the report of the Petitions A to L Committee on the petition of Edmond Carrigan and others, and moved that the report do lie on the table. On his (Mr. 
<page:54>
Clerk, as follows : - " Petitioners pray -(1.) That they be awarded such sum of money as may compensate them for losses which they state they have sustained through the taking of their land in the City of Wellington under the provisions of .The Wel- lington Harbour Board Reclamation and Em- powering Act, 1899.' (2.) That the House will take steps to secure justice for petitioners. "I am directed to report,- "(1.) Upon the first clause of the prayer the Committee has no recommendation to make. "(2.) As to the second clause : From evi- dence before the Committee it appears that ' The Wellington Harbour Board Reclamation and Empowering Act, 1898,' has resulted in hardship to the petitioners, and the Committee therefore recommends the Government to make full inquiry, with a view to affording the peti- tioners relief." The petition set out -- " That your petitioners are wholly unable at their time of life, and having no knowledge of business, to employ the moneys so awarded them in any commercial enterprise, and thev are unable to do anything with such moneys except invest the same at the ordinary rates of interest obtainable at safe security-namely, 5 per cent. at the most. It therefore follows that your petitioner Edmond Carrigan will for the future receive, as in return for the money awarded him by the Compensation Court, $115 & year. less mortgage-tax, in place of the sum of $173 12s. 11d. heretofore received by him for  his said property ; your petitioner Margaret Donnelly will receive $78 15s. instead of the sum of $136 9s. heretofore obtained by her for her said property ; and your petitioner John Callaghan will receive but $60, instead of the sum of #197 16s. obtained by him for his .property. "Your petitioners submit that, in considera- tion of their advanced age, and their having, by dint of sobriety, industry, and saving, accu- umulated the moneys by which they were able to purchase the properties in question, and in .view of the fact that they are wholly unable to devote the amount awarded to them by the Compensation Court to any commercial enter- prise, and will be compelled to invest the money so awarded them in ordinary invest- ments, justice has not been done to them by the Compensation Court. "That, if it is necessary in the public interest that your petitioners should be deprived of their land and property in manner hereinbefore described, it should only be on payment of a full and complete compensation to your peti- tioners." The petitioners requested that a short Bill should be introduced by the Government to give them the redress they asked for in con- sequence of their land being taken compulsorily by the Wellington Harbour Board, which meant to them in each and every case a diminution of their income by at least 50 per cent .. and in one or two cases by more than 50 per cent. That was an injustice which no citizen of New Zea- Mr. Fisher as a matter of justice, the honourable gentle- man should take some steps- by the passing of a short Bill, for instance - to place these peti- tioners in the position in which they sought to be placed. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said there was no doubt, with respect to the power given to the Wellington Harbour Board, that in the exercise of that power, it had been alleged, an injustice had been done to some of the landowners. It was a very large question that this matter opened up-namely, whether, when an award was made under the compensation clause of the Public Works Act, you should re-open those cases in which people were aggrieved. It practically meant an appeal from the Compensation Court, and, as he said, that was a very large question. The only way in which he thought this matter might be dealt with would be by a local Bill, and under a local Bill power might be given for these people who were aggrieved to claim again; and then if the award was not made larger than it was in the first instance they should pay the costs, but if they succeeded in their appeal, then the costs of the appeal should come on the Harbour Board. He might just as well tell the House that Parliament had been grossly deceived ; so much so, indeed, that, in future any legislation coming from the Wellington Harbour Board ought to be looked into very carefully. They took this land and told Par- liament they were going to use it for or in respect to docks ; but they never had any in- tention of using it for docks. They simply took it from other people, and were going to let it themselves for building purposes. He said a more glaring deception was never per- petrated on Parliament, and it was sufficient to warrant Parliament dealing with it, and dealing with it very drastically. If a corpora- tion came to Parliament and asked for certain powers on the strength of an absolute state- ment, and that statement did not tally at all with what was originally intended- Mr. HUTCHESON (Wellington City) rose to a point of order. The Premier was introducing debatable matter in answering a question, and if that were allowed he would like to have the opportunity of replying. Mr. SEDDON said it was not at all de- batable. Mr. HUTCHESON said. Oh! yes, it was. At any rate, the honourable gentleman was making a statement that was entirely wrong. Mr. SEDDON said he had a very good memory. He said the Wellington Harbour Board cleared off the people from this land. They asked for the power, which Parliament gave them. to do this on the distinct statement that they wanted the land for dock purposes. The Board had never shown any intention of carrying out the purpose they had stated they had in view, but were going to lease the land for other purposes altogether. Mr. HUTCHESON asked if this was another vendetta. Mr. SEDDON said it was no vendetta. There 
<page:55>
local bodies to come to Parliament and get legislation to clear off individuals from their land, and then lease or sell the same land to other persons at a big pront ? Mr. HUTCHESON said they simply lost £30,000. That was what it meant. ## WORKERS' COMPENSATION FOR ACCIDENTS. Mr. HANAN (Invercargill) asked the Minis- ter of Labour, If he will introduce legislation" in the direction of amending "The Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act, 1900," so as to enable the Magistrate's Court to have juris- diction in respect of such claims as shall not exceed in amount the sum or sums for which Stipendiary Magistrates have now jurisdiction under " The Magistrates' Courts Act, 1893 "? He would like to point out that, as the law stood at present, if an accident happened to a man, say, working at Orepuki, in Southland, and if such injured person or his representa- tives wished to claim redress or to have the benefit of his rights under the Act, he had to wait until the Compensation Court came down to Invercargill to hear the claim. The Court might be sitting at Auckland, and, consequently, securing a sitting of the Court in Invercargill would involve considerable de- lay - perhaps of months-besides occasioning heavy expense. It was obvious, further, that a man might be prejudiced in his case, not only by reason of the delay, but also by reason of the difficulty of securing the attendance of his wit- nesses when the case was heard. Witnesses might leave the colony before the Court sat. Now, if the amendment were made it would enable the injured man to have ready redress, and obtain promptly the money he might be very much in need of. It would be a step, he submitted, which would be greatly in the in- terests of the working-classes themselves if jurisdiction were given, as he suggested, to the Magistrates to deal with small claims under the Act, so that a poor man who might be injured could recover his money without loss of time and without incurring much expense. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Labour) said he would look into this matter and let the honour- able member have a reply later on. ## PASSAGES TO GREAT BRITAIN FOR NEW ZEALAND TROOPERS. Mr. O'MEARA (Pahiatua) asked the Govern- ment, Whether any direct monetary assistance or reduction in passage-money to returned troopers who are desirous of visiting Great Britain will be granted, as he believed it was understood a promise was made to them that they would have the option of visiting the Old Country previous to returning to their homes ? He understood that a promise was made to those who had left these shores to fight for the Empire that they would be given an oppor- tunity to visit the Old Country before return- ing to this colony ; and, as a number of these men had been sadly disappointed at that pro- mise not having been given effect to, he asked indicated in his question could not be given to those returned troopers who were anxious to visit the Old Country. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said it was not the intention of the Government to find the money to enable troopers to go Home. What had been done was this : The Imperial Government agreed to pay the passages from Capetown to New Zealand ; and if the difference between going to England and then back to New Zea- land was paid either by the Imperial Govern- ment or the returning soldiers, well and good ; but it was not a fair charge on the colony. We do not see our way to do that. If the Imperial authorities desired that a section of our men should go Home he would raise no objection to that, but if it was simply the case of a single individual wanting to take a trip to the Old Country, with the chance that he might not return to the colony, the Govern- ment did not see their way to find the money for that. Mr. O'MEARA asked if the Government would communicate with the Imperial authori- ties and ask them to assist the troopers to visit the Old Country. Mr. SEDDON said, anything that would please our troopers and reward them for what they had done he would be most happy to do, but he did not believe in asking the public to put their hands in their pockets to do it. ## WELLINGTON HARBOUR BOARD ACT 1879 AMENDMENT BILL. On the question, That the Bill be 2.30. read a third time, Mr. HUTCHESON (Wellington City) said,- I think it must be generally conceded by this House that any legislation that has emanated from the Wellington Harbour Board during the last five or six years has not only been carefully drafted, but it has had for its general provisions the practical giving effect to the policy of the Harbour Board. We had the astounding state- ment made here this afternoon that a former Bill introduced by the Wellington Harbour Board was intended to and did enact- Mr. SPEAKER .- Are you referring to some- thing that took place on this Bill, as you can- not refer to what was said on another Bill ? Mr. HUTCHESON .- I am speaking on the Wellington Harbour Board Act 1879 Amend- ment Bill. Mr. SPEAKER. - You cannot refer to some- thing that was said in debate on another Bill. Mr. HUTCHESON .- There are these who look upon emanations from that body or from any other local body as Greek gifts, more or less, and it is thought that every Bill coming from that Harbour Board should be closely examined for evidence of ulterior motives. There are those who charge the Board with motives. Some three years ago the Wellington Harbour Board had under consideration the question of enlarging the representation on the Board, in order to give representation to the population that has fast been accumulating in the Wel- lington Provincial District, and this Bill has 
<page:56>
give adequate representation to the vast number of settlers who have settled in the Wellington District since the Board was constituted. To say that because of attempts in the past to delude the House, and to seek for power that was not for the public good, sufficient ground is shown to warrant a close inspection of any future legislation emanating from the Wellington Harbour Board is by inference and insinuation saying what is not in accordance with fact. Probably, Sir, 1 will find another opportunity to refer more explicitly to a particular statement made in this House, which was not only unwarranted, but which was absolutely at variance with the facts. I trust the House will pass the third reading of this Bill, and other Bills having for their purpose such fair and equitable purposes as the present Harbour Board Bill. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- Inferentially the honourable member who has just sat down refers to what I said this morning in answer- ing a question. I know what he is driving at, although he has not answered the question de- finitely. I repeat that the object of the Bill of 1898 was not accomplished. Poor people were ejected from their buildings, and the land taken from them was vested in the Harbour Board ; and as far as I can hear-and I believe it is true -the Board is going to let the same land to other people, instead of using it for dock purposes, or in connection with the docks, as was stated when the Bill was passed. Mr. TANNER .- Without making any pro- vision for them ? Mr. SEDDON .- Without making any pro- vision at all. An Hon. MEMBER .- That is exactly what you are doing under the Land for Settlements   Act. Mr. SEDDON. - No : we put and increase the people on the land. If that statement be true, then I say that a fraud has been perpetrated upon Parliament, for they got that land for the pur- pose of docks. Mr. HUTCHESON .- You do not know any- thing about it. Mr. SEDDON. - If they did not do it for that, then what did they do it for ? I can only go by the speeches, and the reasons given. If the House had been told that it was only in- tended to put tenants upon the land the Bill would never have got through. Mr. PIRANI .- It is incorrect, and you know it. Mr. SEDDON .-- All I know is that the re- ports of the Select Committee that dealt with the petitions which have been before the House stated that the people suffered an injustice, and the Committee reported that they had been un- generously dealt with. I will not use a stronger term. Those people who were cleared off the land alleged that it had not been used for the purposes for which it was taken, and they natu- rally complained that they should have been ejected from their premises, and the land cut up and was to be leased or sold for purposes similar to those for which they held it. They Mr. Hutcheson utilised for the purposes that Parliament in- tended. I will not myself go between the parties ; all I do say is this: if the land was taken for dock purposes and it has not been so utilised -and it looks very much as if it is intended that it will be simply used as an endowment to bring in rents-I say that if this should prove to be the case, then Parliament passed the Act under a misapprehension. So far as local legislation is concerned, such action will cause Parliament to be careful in regard to what powers they give local bodies in the future. I was referring to "The Wellington Harbour Board and Corporation Empowering Act. 1898." Two Acts were passed, but I think this is the one. The preamble says, -- "And whereas by an Act of the General Assem- bly of New Zealand intituled ' The Wellington Harbour Board Loans Consolidation and Em- powering Act, 1884,' the Board was empowered to construct within the Harbour of Wellington a basin, graving dock, wet-dock, or slip, and also all works necessary for the convenient, proper, and efficient working of any such basin, graving-dock, wet-dock, or slip : And whereas it has been ascertained that, owing to the recent increase in the size and number of the vessels trading to the Port of Wellington, the land described in the said Thirteenth Schedule is insufficient in area for the purposes for which the same is vested in the Board : And whereas. for the purpose of obtaining a sufficient area of land for the construction thereon of the said works, and of other harbour-works, the Board and the Corporation on the thirteenth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and ninety- eight, duly entered into the agreement set out in Schedule A hereto : And whereas it is ex- pedient that the necessary powers should be granted to enable the Board and the Corpora- tion to carry out the said agreement, 3.0. and that further powers should be re- spectively vested in the Board and the Corpora- tion." An Hon. MEMBER .- Read the rest. Mr. SEDDON .- I have read the preamble. and evidently, according to that. it is clearly set out that the land was required for dock pur- poses. Why should they want to take the land for any other purpose ? An Hon. MEMBER .- Read the clause dealing with the land. Mr. SEDDON .-- I do not know what clause the honourable gentleman wants read, but the Government department would never give power to a Harbour Board to remove people from land unless the land was really wanted for Harbour Board purposes - never simply to form an endowment for the Board ; the thing would be monstrous. An Hon. MEMBER .- That is what you are doing every year. Mr. SEDDON .- No, we do not. I have no- thing to withdraw, and shall have something more to say. Mr. ELL (Christchurch City) .- I do not in- tend to take up the time of the House in regard to this Bill, but I wish to take this opportunity 
<page:57>
legislation at an early date to provide for the direct election of all these local bodies. I find that the Act under which this Board was con- stituted in 1879 provided that various means should be adopted for appointing members of this Harbour Board. Three members were to be appointed by the Government ; one was to be elected by the Chamber of Commerce ; the Mayor for the time being was to be a member ; two members were to be elected by the rate- payers of Wellington ; and others were to be appointed by various local bodies. Sir, the complaint has been frequently made that our people in New Zealand are not taking suffi- cient interest in local government ; that in- terest in local affairs, so far as the people of the colony is concerned, is dead. We have no strong, healthy public opinion in regard to local government such as we have in the Old Country and in other parts of the world ; and we want, if we possibly can, to correct that, and to create a strong and live interest in local affairs. To do that, it seems to me, would be to do a good and a very desirable thing. We want people to take a real interest in local matters and in local government. Now, if we give the power of electing the members of all local bodies di- rectly into the hands of the people, instead of allowing them that power only indirectly, I think much good would be done. When the Counties Bill comes down, I think it should provide that all local bodies should be elected on the same day as County and Municipal Councils. All that would be necessary would be that on the same day that the Councils are elected an extra voting-paper should be put into the hands of the voters, and they should vote direct for the election of the #cc-zero members of the respective Harbour Boards. That would give an additional interest, be- cause it would give the people a direct voice in the election of the Board. The right of the people to have a direct voice in the elec- tion of Harbour Boards is beyond question. All the costs and charges incidental to the landing of goods in this country are put upon the consumer, and are paid for by the con- sumer, so that everybody who uses goods pays towards the cost of the management and carry- ing-on of harbour-works throughout the colony. An Hon. MEMBER .- Will they vote ? Mr. ELL .- They will vote if you give them a little more interest-if they are put more directly in touch with local government. To give them a direct vote will, at any rate, do a great deal towards doing away with the apathy that at present exists. I hope we shall in the near future have provision made in the laws whereby the members of local bodies shall be directly elected by the people, instead of being indirectly appointed as at present. Mr. TANNER (Avon) .- I have carefully read the Bill under consideration, and I consider it a most estimable arrangement, by which a kind of redistribution of seats on the Harbour Board is effected, which becomes necessary from time to time. It will be necessary, with the growth of population in Harbour Board dis- Bills of this kind, in order that the rural popu- lation may have some voice in the control of local government affairs. As the conduct of this public body-the Wellington Harbour Board-has come under review, I shall take this opportunity to call attention to an evil of an undoubted kind, which at present has not developed in the colony to any extent, but. instances of which have occurred in Wellington during the last year or two, as very striking instances of what the population of a large town may suffer oven from the action of a local governing body which may be carrying out public improvements. The Wellington Harbour Board has recently obtained legal powers to purchase a number of streets, and clear some very objectionable residences from the face of the earth ; but in doing so no pro- vision was made in the law whereby the Wel- lington Harbour Board was compelled to pro- vide house accommodation for the people in that way dislodged. The result is that those people, mostly belonging to the poorer classes -being working-men-were driven out from their homes, and the effect of getting themselves other accommodation in the city has been to harden the already high rate of rent in this town. In England such legislation is directed differently. If a railway company or a public body there attempts to purchase a block of land in the large cities-in the "slums," as it is called-there is attached to the legislation a provision to the effect that additional accommo- dation equal to the shelter required for the number dislodged shall be provided for them over and above what already exists within the immediate limits of the locality. In this way the large railway companies are compelled, when demolishing insanitary-or, for that matter, sanitary-buildings, to see that a sufficient amount of new accommodation is elsewhere provided, so that the result may not be so disastrous to the general public as it is in such cases as that to which I have just referred. I think the House would be well advised to pay a little more attention than it seems to do to some of the local measures which are passed. The principle which I have named, and which is in operation in England, led, a little while ago, to an injunction being served on the London and North- Western Railway Company, under which the amount of €18,000 was claimed by the Attorney-General for violation of this pro- vision in carrying out one of their improve- ments. If a principle like this were introduced into these Bills I believe it would be far better for the industrial population of our cities than to leave matters as they are now. I trust that a matter like this, which so deeply concerns the material life of the lower classes of the people. will receive that attention from the Govern- ment which its importance deserves, and that some active steps will be taken to put into operation the necessary remedial steps. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) .- The point raised by the honourable member for Avon is a point of considerable importance; but, if he desires that the Harbour Boards and the local bodies 
<page:58>
find accommodation for those whom they dis- lodge, I would ask him to try and induce the (Government to take upon their shoulders the responsibility of finding a place of abode for the people whom they dislodge. I have in my mind not so much those who are dislodged under the land-for-settlements scheme at the present time as what has been taking place in the last twelve months in the City of Dunedin. The railway authorities are making provision for a new rail- way-station in Dunedin, and they have displaced and dislodged from their houses in Dunedin dozens of poor working-people, and have not made the slightest attempt whatever to provide them with other places of abode. Mr. PIRANI .- They have done the same in Palmerston. Mr. J. ALLEN .- They may also have done the same thing in Palmerston-I do not know- but they certainly have done as I have stated in Dunedin. These poor unfortunate people are seeking for a place to put their heads in, and it is most difficult for them to find what they want. Now, if the Harbour Boards have done this kind of thing, then I say the Govern- ment has been a thousand times worse. With regard to the point raised by the Right Hon. the Premier, the honourable member for Avon touched a little on the fringe of that question too, but he did not go far enough. This land that the Premier has been talking about, as having been taken compulsorily by the Wel- lington Harbour Board and applied to a pur-  pose other than that which they assigned to Parliament, is situated in Grainger and Allen Streets, and was not land that was purchased for a dock at all. There was certain land adjoining Grainger Street which the Har- bour Board had to acquire for dock pur- poses, and which they have not vet used, and will not use until such time as they get the money to build a dock. But the particular land that the Premier referred to where these people were dislodged was land that the Wel- lington City Corporation wanted to buy for the special purposes of widening the street and clearing away a slum. It was an arrangement entered into between the City Corporation and the Wellington Harbour Board; not that the Harbour Board wished it particularly, though they certainly wished to see the Corporation remove a slum that was near to the proposed dock, but the Corporation did particularly wish to carry out this object. The Wellington City Corporation, therefore, were the movers in this matter, and they wished the Harbour Board to include this in their scheme ; consequently, the land was taken under the Public Works Act, and compensation was paid for it. Does the Hon. the Premier wish to say that the compen- sation paid under that Act is not fair? If 50, 1 will ask him to consider this : There was other land taken at about the same place-not under the Public Works Act, but by agreement-and the fact that the owners of the land that was taken under the Public Works Act received as high and even higher compensa- tion than wasgiven for that which was taken by Mr. J. Allen under the Public Works Act was awarded a fair value. Now, what is the result ? A 66 ft. wide street was constructed in that neighbourhood, and now, instead of the place being an eyesore, it is pleasing to the eye. The Premier was wrong in stating that the Wellington Harbour Board had no intention of making a dock in that locality. On the contrary, that intention still remains. He was wrong in saying that the people whose land was taken had been de- frauded. They received under the Public Works Act what the Court decided was fair.  Mr. SEDDON .- They have a grievance. Mr. J. ALLEN .- If you are the champion of the people who live in these slums -no doubt it is right they should have a champion-but I say it is better for themselves and for the community that they should be cleared out of these slums. I have given an instance in which it was better, and the place made re- spectable. It was a slum, and the intention was to clear it ; and the shum was cleared and a respectable street made there. Mr. SEDDON .- The power was obtained under an Act of the Wellington Harbour Board for the purpose of obtaining land for a dock. It was not for the purpose of clearing a slum at all. Mr. J. ALLEN .- The Premier forgets that the whole matter was before Parliament, and I believe that the Local Bills Committee, to whom the Bill was referred, went down and examined the place and recommended that this very thing should be done for the purpose of clearing the place. What more can the Premier say ? I think, after what has been said, he will see that he has fallen into an error in making the state- ment he did. I am aware that this was in the Wellington Corporation Act, and that it was not for the Wellington Harbour Board alone that this land should be acquired. As I say, it was a joint acquisition by the Wellington Corpora- \- tion and the Wellington Harbour Board Mr. SEDDON .- It never ought to have been done under that Act at all. Mr. J. ALLEN .- It is a matter of opinion whether it should have been done under that Act or not. The Wellington Harbour Board had to do certain work on land adjoining this. and if it was found necessary to put this in their Bill I do not think it matters. But to say that the Wellington Harbour Board acquired the land under false pretences is a charge that is quite unfair, and ought at once to be refuted. Mr. GUINNESS (Grey) .- I cannot under- stand why the honourable member for Avon and other honourable members are raising a debate . on an Act passed some two years ago. The Right Hon. the Premier simply interjected a correc- tion to what Mr. Hutcheson, the member for Wellington City, stated. I wish to call honour- able members' attention back to the Bill now before the House, and especially to clause 7. which alters the date upon which the financial vear shall commence and end. I am sorry the Right Hon. the Premier did not notice this clause when the Bill was going through Com- mittee, because I think it is a most objection- 
<page:59>
Harbour Board in the colony has its financial vear defined - when it shall commence and when it shall end ; and it is provided that its accounts for that period shall each year be laid on the table of this House. I wish to know why a special exception is to be made for the Wel- lington Harbour Board. I think that clause of the Bill should be struck out. All the other Harbour Boards have to balance their accounts on the 31st December. I think this matter ought to receive the attention of honourable members. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City). - I tho- roughly indorse the statement of the Right Hon. the Premier that this House is too much in the habit of accepting the representations of local bodies in regard to Bills promoted by them in this House. I have frequently opposed Bills introduced to this House by the Corporation of the City of Wellington, but I am always met by members from other parts of the colony with the objection that the Bill comes here with the imprimatur of the local body. so that anything said by any member of the House in opposition to the Bill carries with it no weight whatever. I will mention one special instance. Some few years ago a Bill was promoted in this House by the Wellington City Council for the purpose, amongst other things, of widening streets and for the purchase of an estate called " Miramar." I showed in this House the whole effect of the proposal to purchase that property, but, notwith- standing all my representations, the Bill, with that proposal in it, passed through this Chamber.  In accordance with the custom which then prevailed, I reprinted the speech which I had delivered in this House on that occasion, and circulated it amongst the citizens of Wellington.   The privilege and the right to reprint our speeches in Hansard for circulation amongst the people has since been taken away by the Minis- ter in charge of the Printing Office. But, as the result of the circulation of that speech throughout the city, that so-called Conservative branch of the Legislature -- the Legislative Council-struck out the proposal in the Bill relating to the purchase of Miramar ; and now I understand we are to have the proposal to pur- chase that property again placed before us, with the imprimatur of the Wellington City Corpora- tion. We shall see what happens. The Premier is perfectly correct in saying that the Welling- ton Harbour Board Bill, which proposed to take lands for Harbour Board purposes, also ex- pressed the intention to take the land in Allen and Grainger Streets for dock purposes. An Hon. MEMBER .- The dock is not required. Mr. FISHER .- That is not the question. Now. what has been the result ? The land has not been used for dock purposes, nor was it required for dock purposes. The land was compulsorily taken from the poor people to whom it belonged, and has been turned to profitable account by the Harbour Board. The honourable member for Bruce, who pokes his oar into everything, whether it concerns him or not, says the land was not taken for the construction of a dock, but for street-widening Harbour Board to do with the widening of streets. Then, he says the land was taken to do away with slums, and to make things pleasing to the eye. How touching! How affecting! These slums, the residences of these poor people, who have lived there perhaps twenty-five or thirty years, were removed in order to make things pleasing to the eye. And in order to make things pleasing to the eye you take away from these people more than half their income. $137 a year is taken from one of the petitioners-John Callaghan. If $137 a year was taken from the member for Bruce, would that be pleasing to his eye ? This is the language of the petitioners :- "That your petitioners are wholly unable at their time of life, and having no knowledge of business, to employ the moneys so awarded them in any commercial enterprise, and they are unable to do anything with such moneys except invest the same at the ordinary rates of interest obtainable at safe security - namely, 5 per cent. at the most. It therefore follows that your petitioner Edmond Carrigan will for the future receive, as in return for the money awarded him by the Compensation Court, $115 a year, less mortgage-tax, in place of the sum of €173 12s. 11d. heretofore received by him for his said property ; your petitioner Margaret Donnelly will receive $78 15s. instead of the sum of $136 9s. heretofore obtained by her for her said property ; and your petitioner John Callaghan will receive but $60, instead of the sum of #197 16s. obtained by him for his property." That is to say, the annual income of Edmond Carrigan has been reduced from £173 to $115, a difference to him of $58 per annum ; the annual income of Margaret Donnelly has been reduced from £136 to $78, a difference to her of $58 per annum ; and the annual income of John Callaghan has been reduced from #197 to $60, making to him, a poor man, who owes his subsistence to this property, which represents the whole savings of a lifetime, a difference of £137 per annum. One would not so much ob- ject if the land had been legitimately taken for dock purposes : the objection would not be so strong. But what has the Harbour Board done with the land so taken ? The land has been let by the Board at a profit to the Board. The Board is consequently deriving profits which properly belong to these poor people. And I ask those honourable members who profess to know so much about local Bills if that is a state of things that should result from their legislation in this Parliament. And yet we have members here who profess to know so much more about these things than we who live in the city, we who have studied these questions and have probed them to the bottom. Our opinions are treated as light as air. Honour- able gentlemen who come from the Bay of Islands and from the Bluff, and from the east and the west, know all about these matters, while we, who have the interests of our con- stituents at heart, know nothing. We sit here, forsooth, listening to gentlemen like the honour- 
<page:60>
taking of this property in this compulsory way is justified in order to make things pleasing to the eye. Now, I want to ask the honourable member in charge of the Bill whether any representation has been made to him in regard to the inclusion in the Bill of a provision for the representation of the wharf labourers-the working-classes-upon this Board. Mr. WILFORD .- I will reply presently. Mr. FISHER .- I should like the honourable gentleman to answer that now. Mr. WILFORD .- Yes. Mr. FISHER. - Such representation has been made to him. Was an amendment to that effect moved when the Bill was in Com. mittee ? Mr. WILFORD .- No. I will explain that presently. Mr. FISHER .- Well, I shall move that the Bill be recommitted for the purpose of recon- sidering clause 5, to enable me to propose a new clause, giving special representation to the wharf labourers. Labour should have special representation on the Board, as well as the special representation for the payers of dues and the special representation for the Chamber of Commerce. I am compelled to take thisstep now because I was detained in town by a violent rain- and hail storm, which kept me standing for five minutes under a verandah, and conse- quently I arrived in the House five minutes late, to discover that the Bill had been put through Committee in three minutes. An Hon. MEMBER .- Less than that. Mr. FISHER .- Well, I suppose I am in  fault for not being here ; but there were two other members in the House who were present at a deputation at which we were requested to move this clause. Had I been here, I would have moved that the wharf labourers, who are as much concerned as any one in the affairs of the Harbour Board, should have the right to elect one member to that Board. If it be answered that this is class representation, then the rejoinder is this : that the City already has three members on that Board, who represent the whole city-namely, the Mayor and the two elected members. Then there is a representa- tive for the payers of dues. That is distinctly class representation. Then, there is a repre- sentative for the Chamber of Commerce. That, again, is distinctly ciass representation. I say, then, that there ought to be one member on that Board representing the purely labour in- terest. That is class representation, of course, but the precedents to which I have referred should remove all argument against the work. ing-men having their own representative. I therefore move, That the Bill be recommitted, for the purpose of reconsidering clause 5. Mr. SEDDON .- That clause about changing the financial year, I think, should be recom- mitted. Mr. FISHER .- I propose that the Bill be recommitted. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston). - I merely second the amendment for the purpose of saying a few words on this matter, and I believe it will Mr. Fisher that the honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) was a supporter of the Bill under which this land was taken when it was brought down in 1898. Contra:y to his usual practice. he seconded the second reading of the Bill after Mr. Hutcheson, and he gave this Bill his ap- proval, including as it did the purchase of the very land that he has to-day condemned up hill and down dale. Then, the honourable member reflects on the rest of us as ignorant members who do not live in the city, and who supported the Bill in our ignorance. The honourable mem- ber does not know everything that goes on in the Legislature. It will be news for him, per- haps, to hear that the Bill as it passed this House had no provision at all for the widening of the streets. Perhaps he does not know that the Wellington Harbour Board, of which he is a member, had nothing to do with the clauses regarding the widening of the streets, but they were put into the measure by the Legislative Council, and a very good provision too, I think. But the beginning and the end of this trouble, although the honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) would make you think so, did not originate with this Harbour Board Bill at all. It originated with the fact that a person who wanted an extortionate price for his property entrusted him with a petition to get money by using the power of Parliament which he could The honouraide not get by legal means. member presented a petition from one of these men who were dispossessed of their lands. who valued his property at €10,800, and was getting an annual revenue of #173 from it. I ask any of you what sort of an investment of that sum of money in this City of Wellington it would be that only realised #173 a year? And yet he asks us to believe that this request for £10,800 compensation was a fair request, and that, by not giving it, the man was robbed by the Harbour Board. A Compensation Court was set up under the Act, consisting of a Supreme Court Judge and two Assessors-Mr. Kennedy Macdonald and Mr. Muir-and this man, Sir, who had been offered by the Harbour Board $1,100, and had asked $10,800, was awarded £19,300 $1,200. Other claimants claimed for their property. The Board offered them $5,097, and the Court awarded them $5,350. Why, if the Premier had taken the same action under the Land for Settlements Act and any one had attempted to father a petition through this House as the honourable member for Welling- ton City (Mr. Fisher) had done, the Premier would be the first man to condemn him and say that the land was taken under the laws of the land, and that the value given was a fair one. But, besides this, the Harbour Board offered to find the claimants a similar investment in the City of Wellington which would realise as much money as they were getting out of the invest- ments. Surely it is time the Premier looked at these matters from a business point of view, and if the present method of taking land under the Public Works Act is not satisfactory he should bring in an amending Act. Then, the Premier tells us that this land 
<page:61>
is not being used for the purpose of the dock, | the Corporation of the city. To the other point but is being sold and leased. Does any one mean to say that a public body ought to allow lands to lie idle until they are in a position to use them ? The part they have reserved for the dock the Board has made no effort to get rid of, and it will be used for the dock as soon as everything is ready. The honourable member for Wellington Suburbs can tell you far more about the intentions of the Board than I can, and, as far as that matter is concerned. I will leave it to him. But there is one thing I would like to correct the Premier in. This land is not vet let for a profit. Mr. SEDDON .- I said they had advertised it. Mr. PIRANI .- Why not wait until it is let ? Why anticipate what a public body is going to do ? As a matter of fact only one section has bien let. The whole point of this turns not on the administration of the Board, but on the ad- ministration of the Public Works Act; and I say that if these men have not got value for their lands it is the fault of the Government of the day who put that legislation on the statute- book, and it is they who ought to obey the legislation or amend the Act, and put it on the lines of justice they think it ought to be. But I know others who know the pro- ferty, and they say that the men got good compensation for all the property was worth. The property was wanted for the best of public purposes-clearing away slums, widening streets, and constructing a dock; and I would like to know for what better purpose you could use money and acquire land for. And yet you talk of dispossessing tenants. The honourable  member for Bruce (Mr. Allen) pointed out about the Dunedin Railway-station, and I can point out in Palmerston a whole street of cottages that were taken by the Railway Department for railway purposes, without any attempt being made to provide similar accommodation for the same tenants elsewhere. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) .- I desire to mike a personal explanation. I understand that, in referring to my remarks upon this Bill, the honourable member for Palmerston twitted me with having been an ardent and warm sup- porter of the original Bill when it was before the House. Mr. PIRANI .- I said you supported the second reading. Mr. FISHER .- Oh. I see; the honourable member wishes to modify what he said. With your permission, Sir, I will read what I did say. it only shows how careful one ought to be in accepting the representations of certain mem- bors in this House, particularly when they profess, as some acute lawyers do in Court, to In: reading something from a book which is not in the book at all. In Vol. 101 of Hansard, of Ius, page 489, speaking on the Wellington Harbour Board Bill, Mr. Fisher said : - "The unanimity arrived at between the bodies interested, referred to in the concluding remark of the honourable gentleman, might be taken to mean that the Harbour Board of the City of Wellington had again absorbed some other valuable portion of the assets and properties of \-that the Bill had been before the Local Bills Committee-he attached no importance what- ever, because every member of the House must know how little the general body of members of the House understood the contents and far- reaching provisions of such a Bill as this. He had no objection to any of the provisions of the Bill except to the one which enabled this, a local body, to raise a further loan of $150,000. He had a standing objection to local bodies in any part of the colony being allowed to burden themselves with loans of such a magnitude ; but in this case he intended to interpose no objection, because, on the one hand, in the case of the Harbour Board, they had a pro- gressive, virile body : on the other hand, they had an inane and inert body, the Corporation of the city." Mr. PIRANI .- Read page 500 ; you have got the wrong Bill. Mr. FISHER .- Well, at page 500 Mr. Fisher said,- " He was a little amused also at the honour- able gentleman who introduced this Bill calling it the supplement to the other one. Why, this was the Bill. The local knowledge and the knowledge of the legislation on the subject dis- played by Mr. Duthie was to him not only astounding but amusing, and he was sorry the honourable gentleman was not present. That was not his fault. He was supposed to be there in his place during the discussion of such an important Bill. He thought the honour- able gentleman said just now that he was Mayor of the city when this Te Aro Reclama- tion was carried out, and, if his recollection served him, the honourable gentleman made much the same statement during that now cele- brated by-election for Wellington City. The honourable gentleman had as much to do with the Te Aro Reclamation as many of those mem- bers who did not live in Wellington at all. At the initiation of that great scheme-for it was a great scheme-the honourable gentleman was vegetating somewhere in the neighbourhood of Wanganui, and he would tell the honourable gentleman - for he was sure the honourable member did not know it to that moment-what the history of that Te Aro Reclamation was." And then I gave the whole history of that reclamation, which I carried out from beginning to end. Mr. PIRANI .- Read page 502. Mr. FISHER .- Does the honourable gentle- man want me to read the whole volume of Hansard ? I supported the second reading be- cause it is always invidious of a member repre- senting a city to oppose a Bill promoted by a local authority. Mr. PIRANI .- You opposed the previous Bill. Mr. FISHER .- I think the honourable mem- ber is somewhat confused about these Bills. I am acquainted with the history of most of them. I may say that it has sometimes hap- pened that I have been unable to approve of all the provisions of these Bills, and, although I have often found it impossible to bring about an 
<page:62>
succeeded in prevailing upon the Legislative Council to amend the Bills in conformity with the wishes of the people of this city. Mr. SPEAKER. - I think the honourable member is exceeding the bounds of a personal explanation. Mr. FISHER .-- I say that my action through- out in regard to these Bills has been consistent, and I also say, with the Premier, that it is un- wise for Parliament to always take for granted everything that is stated by local bodies in favour of their own local Bills. Mr. W. FRASER (Wakatipu) .- I understand that objection has been raised to this Bill be- cause clause 7 makes the financial year expire on the 30th September instead of at the end of December. If members will only take the trouble to read the first page or two of the Bill, where reasons are given why the Bill should be passed, they will find the reasons set forth very clearly indeed why the Board desires to have the financial year end on the 30th September, and I cannot see, myself, any better reasons which it is possible to give ; and if members only read what I have suggested, I think they will come to the conclusion that there is no necessity to recommit the Bill. It says .- "There are four reasons why the 30th September has been suggested as the most suitable time for the closing of the financial year :- " Firstly, that it will enable the Chairman of the year to deal with the finances of his year of office at the annual meeting in January, and  before vacating his position. "Secondly, a year ending in December closes in the middle of the wool season, and an early or late season, or an insufficiency of vessels to remove the produce, renders the annual statis- tics irregular and not comparable, whereas the 30th September is prior to the commencement of the wool season. "Thirdly, the work of balancing and audit, with the preparation of statistics, et cetera, would be completed before the rush of the wool season, in place of being as at present under- taken in the busiest period. " Fourthly. as the Board came into active existence on the 1st October, statistics could be collated for twelve-monthly periods continuously from the commencement of the Board's opera- tions." These reasons are, I think, most excellent, and any one who has any knowledge of the work which such a Board as this has to do must see that they are weighty reasons. Surely, because other Boards have not the same special reasons as this one for altering the date of the financial vear, that is no reason why the request of this Board should not be acceded to. I do hope the House will pause before it stultities itself, be- cause I do not think there is any reason which can be set forth which will controvert the reasons given in the explanatory page to this Bill. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) .- I trust the House will not agree to recommit this Bill. I think it would be a pure waste of time; Mr. Fisher Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) that he can always get what he wants inserted in a Bill put in in the Legislative Council. It would there- fore be a sheer waste of time to recommit the Bill. I was surprised to see that the honour- able member has become a convert to the rights of property-owners. He has used the same arguments on their behalf which the so-called " bloated squatter "-the owner of the Hatuma Estate-used on his own behalf-namely, that he could not get as much interest from his compensation as he could get from his property. That argument has now been boldly advanced by the member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) in favour of certain persons in Wellington. 1 do trust that he will continue in that frame of mind, and both by his speeches and his vote defend the rights of property-holders. I trust it is not a mere flash in the pan. Mr. FISHER .- Sir, may 1, with your per- mission, add a few words to my amendment. I wish my amendment to read as follows : "That the Bill be recommitted for the purpose of reconsidering clause 5, so as to provide that one member shall be elected from the Wharf Labourer's Union, such member so elected to be a bona fide member of the Wharf Labourer's Union." Mr. T. . MACKENZIE (Waihemo) .-- I am going to support the recommittal of the Bill. The honourable member for Wakatipu has not at all made a clear case in favour of what the Board desires in connection with clause 5. He read out a list of reasons, but these might apply to every other Harbour Board in the colony, and yet, forsooth, we are asked to make an ex- ception in this one case in the rendering of returns to this House. The whole of the Boards in this colony have to render those returns. which are supposed to be a guide to the country. I am astonished that the honourable member. who usually shows good common-sense, should have opposed the recommittal of the Bill for the insertion of the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Wellington City. Hon. MEMBERS .- You are on the wrong amendment. It is an amendment to clause 5. Mr. MACKENZIE .-- I understand the Bill is to be recommitted for the purpose of re- considering clause 7. Mr. SEDDON .- It was originally intended that the whole Bill be recommitted, but the honourable member now asks for the recom- mittal of clause 5 only. It is quite competent. however, for the honourable member for Wai- hemo to ask for the recommittal of the whole Bill. Mr. MACKENZIE .- I regard the recommittal of that clause as essential. I see no reason why one Board should make up its accounts on the 31st December, while all the others have to do this on another date. For these reasons I wish to support the honourable member. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .-- I want to explain. so that I might not be accused of being unfair to the Wellington Harbour Board in respect to this matter. In going into the history of the passing of these Wellington Harbour 
<page:63>
According to the preamble of the Wellington Harbour Board Bill, the Bill was promoted for dock and harbour purposes. In another place it is changed entirely. In one respect it is still being maintained and kept for harbour purposes. It is simply used as a means of taking certain lands for street- widening purposes, for closing streets, and ac- quiring private lands to sell or lease the same. If the Wellington Borough Council had come with a Bill for that purpose-and it was the proper body to do it-I do not think it would have been objected to for a moment. It would appear as if clause 11 had got into the Bill in another place. Mr. PIRANI .- Only subclauses (1), (2), and (3). Mr. SEDDON .- Section 11 does it. The subsections referred to are subsections to sec- tion 11 :- " The Board may, in addition to the powers to take land vested in it by the Act, purchase or take under the provisions of ' The Public Works Act, 1894,' any land, together with the buildings thereon, excepting land vested in Her Majesty the Queen, that it may require to pro- vide approaches to any of the land described in the said agreement, and for the purpose of the diversions of the streets and railways hereby authorised, and for any works the Board is authorised to execute under this Act, and may purchase or take in addition to the land actually required all or any of the land described in Schedule B hereto, as the Board may think  fit." Schedule B gives the land taken. First of all it has the railway between it and the dock-site, which is really between it and the land they are reclaiming, and the main street is between this land and the railway. The dock-site is to seaward. and further along Clyde Quay, so that the land in Schedule B had nothing whatever to do with the dock, nor the approaches to the dock. Schedule B is as follows-and you will find it stuck in at the end of the Bill :- "All that land in the City of Wellington shown on a plan deposited at the office of the Marine Department, Wellington, and marked ' M.D. 2193' : Bounded towards the north by Victoria Street, towards the west by Tory Street ; towards the south by Courtenay Place, and towards the east by Cambridge Terrace ; including therein the streets known as Grainger Street and Allen Street, as hatched in green lines thereon, but excluding thereout the lands contained in the Eighth Schedule." So that the blame seems to be not so much with the Harbour Board ; but its Bill was evidently used, not to provide land for harbour purposes, but to remove an eyesore from Wel- lington, and, if so, everything I said was right. We ought, therefore, to be careful. I say, Sir, that the man who uses his neighbour to per- petrate a wrong is as bad as the man who is the instrument and wrong-doer. Mr. PIRANI .- Parliament. Mr. SEDDON .- Parliament is not perfect, and is subject to err like the rest. All I can to be removed for sanitary reasons, then the matter should have come before the House in the form of a Bill for that purpose. I object to using the machinery of a Harbour Board to take land for other than Harbour Board pur- poses, and to convert it into an endowment- for that is really what it means-and it had no connection with the dock works at all. Mr. PIRANI .- It never produced what they paid for it. Mr. SEDDON .- That is all the worse for the Harbour Board. Mr. PIRANI .- It was the Legislature that made them do it. Mr. SEDDON .- Any one reading the con- templated Bill can come to no other conclusion than that the land was intended for dock or harbour purposes absolutely. That is how it was introduced and passed by the House. Not. withstanding that, it comes back with another section, or several subsections in it ; and if, as is stated, the Harbour Board will lose money by the transaction, then all I can say is that the action is all the more reprehensible-it is not straightforward. As regards the complaints in respect to the land, we know no one gets what he asks for when he goes before the Compensation Court. And we know that there are also 4.0. some very glaring cases, where people put in claims for very large amounts over and above any reasonable valuation. I do not, of course, know the merits of this case beyond this : that the Committees of this House have upon various occasions recommended that repa- ration be made to the original landowners. Mr. HUTCHESON .- They have never let the other side know what they were doing ; it has been low-down work. Mr. SEDDON .- Very well ; if that is so, the House is still open. But you should not, except in well-authenticated and grave cases, give a right of appeal, because, if you do, you will have no end whatever to the compensation claims. An Hon. MEMBER .- We will come back on the Government. Mr. SEDDON .- I do not know that you can come back on the Government ; but if there has been a miscarriage of justice, if there has been any wrong done, and a case can be made out for Parliament to deal with, I say Parlia- ment has a right to deal with it, whether it is the Government or the individual that is in fault. I repeat that, after looking up the debates, after looking up the records of Par- liament, I find that under this Bill the purpose was entirely changed. I say that if a Bill was brought in for the construc- tion of a road by a County Council or a Borough Council, and that under that there was a block of land that some one wanted to have taken for any other purpose than a road, or some ordinary purpose under the Public Works Act, and to have special powers given to take that land from individuals, and it was permitted, that would be a very dangerous pre- cedent ; and, this being a dangerous precedent, it is my duty to point that fact out to the 
<page:64>
to me this question of Grainger Street. If you say it is a matter of lung space for the Town of Wellington, and that such places ought to be opened up, I say at once that that is a very good thing to do, but what I complain of is the way in which it has been done. I do not think Parliament understood it, or would have passed it through if they had understood it ; and if they said they were doing it for the purpose of putting the railway on it-that they were going to widen the street and shift the railway-then they have no right to cut it up, as is their in- tention, and to use it for building purposes. An Hon. MEMBER .- The Act gave them the power. Mr. SEDDON .- I know the Act gives them power. It is very extraordinary. Section 11 SOVS, - " All land so purchased or taken shall vest in the Board for the purposes for which it is constituted, and the Board may sell and dis- pose of any lands so purchased or taken, by public auction, private contract, or exchange." An Hon. MEMBER .- Read the section. Mr. SEDDON .- I have read that part of the section which provides how the Board is to deal with the land taken. It includes the land in Grainger Street, and this land " shall vest in the Board for the purposes for which it was constituted, and the Board may sell and dispose of any land so purchased." I say the land so purchased was taken under Schedule B. It can be sold by public auction or private contract, which is again monstrous, or it may be exchanged or leased. Well, this House, if it knew the facts' of the case, would no more think of giving the right to the Wellington Harbour Board to take lands for the simple pur-     pose of selling or exchanging with somebody else than it would think of making the Wellington Harbour Board a present of the site on which this house stands. At all events, I have called attention to it. It is not a vendetta ; it is simply a matter from which we ought to take warning in future. We are too careless con- cerning these Bills. I myself have been, I, must confess, somewhat indifferent as regards local Bills. Members bring them up, and we take it for granted that they apply only to the localities, and that the members concerning them know best ; and when there are no peti- tions against them we take little trouble. Mr. PIRANI. - By Jove you do, if I bring them in ! Mr. SEDDON .- No, I do not, but I think I ought to. What I was going to say was about the change of the financial year. If you are going to change the financial year of the Har- bour Board to suit the wool season, what are we going to do with our nancial year which is fixed to end on the 31st March ? How are you going to get the returns laid on the table of this House if you change the financial year of the Board to the 30th September, because the present time causes some little inconvenience to the Board ? The other Boards would require the same thing. I do not think you should change the date of the financial year unless you Wir. Seddon given-on account of the wool season and that the Harbour Board's staff is busy. Then, again, why should it be done in a Bill which is simply dealing with representation on the Board ? Nine out of ten members of the House would take it that the Bill is introduced for the  sole purpose of giving country representation on the Harbour Board, and here is a clause slipped in altering the financial year. An Hon. MEMBER .- That was explained in introducing the Bill. Mr. SEDDON .- That is to the credit of the honourable member, but I had not read it, and it was only when the honourable member for the Grey called attention to it that I noticed it was not desirable. There has been no good reason shown for it. Why should not other Boards make the same application ? It is the wool season in Napier, in Christchurch, and Otago, and if these Boards asked, for the same reason, that we should change the financial year, we should grant it in the one case as well as in the other. An Hon. MEMBER .- What harm would there be ? Mr. SEDDON .- It means that the balance- sheet, when laid upon the table of the House, would be nearly twelve months old. Mr. WILFORD (Wellington Suburbs) .- I regret that the discussion this afternoon has turned upon the provisions of Acts dealing with the Wellington Harbour Board, other than that which I am fathering, if I may use the term : and I much regret the discussion which has taken place has been upon lines of general policy, some honourable members condemning the action of the Board in regard to the Grainger Street property, and others in refer- ence to the legislation which was introduced in' 1898, while most speakers have ignored the matter dealt with in my Bill. Now, I should like to take this opportunity of telling the Pre- mier that, notwithstanding the fact that certain clauses were introduced by the other branch of the Legislature, the statute of 1893 has been carried out in its entirety by the Wellington Har- bour Board. They have not violated any legal principle. They have not acted in any way con- trary to the spirit of the statute empowering them to do certain things ; and I think it is time enough for the Premier to take objection and move in some way to put a matter right when a wrong has been done. The attitude of the Wellington Harbour Board is absolutely consis- tent with the statutes under which it is incor- porated. There is no provision in the statuto which it has not observed, and subclauses (1), (2), and (3) of clause 11 of the Act of 1898 have given no power which the Wellington Harbour Board has exceeded in any shape or form. Now. Sir, I want to say one word in reference to the last clause of this Bill, or the Schedule, in refer- ence to the altering of the date upon which the annual meeting is to be held. May I ask honourable members from other districts what does it matter to them, whether the annual meetings of the Wellington Harbour Board shall be held at the date suggested in this Bill  
<page:65>
If the Harbour Board of Wellington respect- fully presents to this House a Bill by which they desire to have a date fixed for the annual presentation of their report and balance-sheet which is in conformity with the conditions of things that are existing, why should honour- able members from other districts condemn it ? What is the objection ? There must be some substratum of purpose underlying the objection which honourable members assign for their onpasition to this Bill. I did not think it particularly necessary. in moving the second reading, to say anything in regard to that clause, because I considered, if the Harbour Board of Wellington desire that its annual meetings should be held on a particular date. and if they possess good and fair reasons for altering the date, then honourable members who represent other districts which have not got their dates altered should make no ob- jection. I will guarantee that hardly any of the members from other districts have taken the trouble to read the annual report and the balance-sheet of the Wellington Harbour Board. If we are in a prosperous condition, and if our trade is continually expanding at a very rapid rate, much of it is due to the fact that Wel- lington is the central seaport town of the colony, and to the fact that the Wellington Harbour Board is doing a considerable amount of the export and import traffic of the colony. What is the meaning of the opposition to this clause in the Bill? Why does the honourable member for the Grey, who is, of course, in- terested in his own Board at Greymouth, seck to prevent the Harbour Board of Wellington fixing a particular date which suits its circum- stances best for the presentation of its annual   report and balance-sheet ? The honourable member says it is altering things. I grant that it is. That is the watchword of this side of the House. We are continually wanting to alter things so as to make them better and more comfortable for the people at large. Supposing that in the interests of the Greymouth Harbour Board the honourable member for the Grey introduced an amending Bill, and he asked that the date of its annual meeting should be fixed for one particular day, instead of the present day, would honourable members from other districts dream of opposing that suggestion and wish ? An Hon. MEMBER .- You do not understand the objection. Mr. WILFORD .- I understand the honour- able member's objection quite well, as he well knows. The honourable member for the Grey has no real reason for urging it, seeing that it does not affect him. If I was proposing by this Bill to alter the date on which the annual meet- ing of the Harbour Board of his district was Of held I could understand his objection. course, it has no particular interest for me whether Parliament agrees to the amendment or not ; but when a Board asks to be allowed to have this date fixed, why should there be opposi- tion to it when it does not matter a snap of the VOL. CXVII .- 4. ing this change of date are such as honourable members can well realise to be quite pertinent. Of course, we have had it suggested that, as a general date is fixed for the annual meetings of Harbour Boards by section 55 of the Harbours Act of 1878, therefore any alteration should be looked upon with suspicion. But when honour- able members understand what is really the ob- ject that the Wellington Harbour Board has in view, I hope they will help me in getting this Bill through in its entirety. I do not know why the honourable member for Waihemo should move to recommit this clause again. An Hon. MEMBER. - I suggested that, for statistical purposes, it was desirable that the accounts of these Boards should be made up at the end of the year. Mr. WILFORD .- Well, supposing they are. That seems to me to be like the honourable gentlemen's other remarks in regard to this matter-not pertinent to this particular ques- tion. The question here is, the financial year closes on the 31st December, and section 55 of the Harbours Act provides that the annual meeting shall be held on the third Monday in the month of January in each year for the purpose of receiving the audited accounts. There is provision also made under the Local Bodies Act to enable the annual meeting to be held at a date later on. The election of Chair- man in the case of the Wellington Harbour Board is held on the first Tuesday after the 20th February, and it has never yet hap- poned that the accounts have been ready, be- cause the year ends on the 31st December, and the accounts are not audited and printed in time for the Chairman to make his report and present them before he vacates his office. Now, Sir, I do not understand the motion of the honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) in regard to this extra representa- tion on the Board for the interests of labour, and the reason I do not understand it is this : I claim, as a member of the Wellington Harbour Board, to be a representative of labour ; and also that the honourable member for Welling- ton City, Mr. George Fisher, is a representative of labour ; and so also is the Hon. Mr. Fraser, of the Upper House. I claim to be just as directly representative of labour on the Wellington Har- bour Board as I am a representative of labour in this Chamber, and I should feel very indig- nant indeed if any of my constituents suggested the selection of any particular member in this Chamber as a representative of the interests of labour while I hold a seat here. I do not under- stand the honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher). I am quite sure there is no man in the City of Wellington, or in the Suburbs of Wellington, no matter what his station in life may be, who has come to me with a grievance, that I have considered a real one, which I have not earnestly taken up and sought to get redressed. I feel that this motion is a reflection upon me as a member of the Wellington Harbour Board, and as a mem- ber of the House of Representatives ; for if extra 
<page:66>
of the labour portion of the community, that is a distinct reflection on my capabilities. I know perfectly well that on more than one occasion I have been the mediator between the wharf labourers and the Harbour Board in con- nection with certain grievances which they have had redressed. Why some other repre- sentative should be placed on the Harbour Board as directly representative of the in- terests of labour I am quite at a loss to understand. It may be that neither the honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) nor myself are labourers in the same sense that the wharf labourers are. I say this, however : that if any man comes to me in con- nection with any breach of the law affecting labour, or in connection with any grievance under which he has been placed, whether he be a mechanic or labourer, I can realise what he desires, and be able to grasp with ordinary intelligence the facts of his par- ticular case; and I am prepared to represent his case -- and, perhaps, although it may seem egotistical-to represent it in the House just as well as if these men had a direct representa- tive of labour to plead their cause. Take the case of Wellington City : They have three par- liamentary representatives on the Harbour Board. We will take it that the Wharf Labourers' Union decide, if this power is granted them, to elect Mr. John Hutcheson as their member on the Board. I take it, if Mr. John Hutcheson be chosen by the workers to be their member on the Wellington Harbour Board, there will then be four parliamentary representatives. Mr. John Hutcheson has proved his capacity and capability for that posi- tion. I am not going to say anything against his work on that Board, and I never will. But I say, in regard to Mr. Hutcheson, what would   be the position suppose he were elected? We would have four members of Parliament there ; and is Mr. Hutcheson a more direct representa- tive of labour than I am? Mr. J. ALLEN .- Yes. Mr. WILFORD. - Mr. Hutcheson may have had in his experience to do certain kinds of labouring work, and all the more honour to him for it. I have not had that to do, but I have had to work just as hard as any man. Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- Not practically. Mr. WILFORD .- The honourable member is about the most theoretical member in this House. Mr. T. MACKENZIE. - That is the lawyer's view. Mr. WILFORD .- It is the correct one. But I shall ask honourable members to hesitate before recommitting this Bill for either of the purposes suggested by honourable members. I have to thank honourable members for the utmost consideration given in carrying this measure to its present stage. The second read- ing passed easily with the help and co-opera- tion of members, for without the co-operation of honourable members no member can hope to get anything through this House. I learned Mr. Wilford will give the same consideration to the passing of this Bill as they give to the other measure I have mentioned. Mr. HUTCHESON (Wellington City) .- Sir, I should just like to examine, in passing, for one moment the logic of my honourable friend the member for Wellington Suburbs. He claimed-and I do not dispute his claim-to be as good a representative of labour inte- rests on the Wellington Harbour Board as myself, or any one else; but those who are asking for this amendment of the constitution no doubt. in their wisdom, are looking at the future, when there may be one of those hide- \- bound Tory Governments in office who would not be likely to put a representative of labour like the honourable member for the Suburbs on the Board, but would put a hide-bound Tory on the Board ; and then where is his logic? While I altogether deprecate class representation, I am bound to admit that the present constitution of the Board does to a certain extent give re- presentation to class. If the question of what interests are to be represented on Harbour Boards is raised, I submit it should be gene- ral throughout the Boards of the colony, and not through the medium of a local Bill confined to one Board only. Now, as to what the Pre- mier said this afternoon in connection with the annual balance-sheet, I would ask him why he should single out the Wellington Harbour Board from all the other Harbour Boards in the colony. I refer to the honourable gentleman's argument as to the proposed alteration of the date of the balance-sheet. I will give the Premier a good reason why the date of the Wellington Harbour Board's balance-sheet should be different. The honourable gentleman asked why this Harbour Board, of all others, should have this privilege. The Wellington Harbour Board is unique in the matter of its operations. It is the only Harbour Board in the colony that does its stevedoring, storing, pressing, and holding wool-sales. The present time for the preparation of the balance- sheet occurs right in the height of the wool season. The time proposed in the Bill is much more suitable, more especially as it fits in with the date of the incorporation of the Welling- ton Harbour Board, and consecutive annual statistics can be prepared from the date of the initiation of the Board's operations. It thus suits the executive officers of the Board, as pointed out by the honourable member for Wellington Suburbs. Mr. SEDDON .- Why not make it the 31st March ? Mr. HUTCHESON .- For the simple reason that the officers of the Board and the Board itself can better ascertain the result of its work- ing when the end of the wool season comes. The Wellington Harbour Board is pressing wool for months after what is generally considered to be the end of the wool season. It is pressing, storing, and holding sales, and surely it ought to be allowed, provided it does not interfere with the operations of other Boards, to study its own convenience. I consider it is almost humiliat- 
<page:67>
balance-sheet at a certain period. Surely it is a matter of no consequence to any other body, seeing that it does not interfere with the other Harbour Boards of the colony. But, Mr. Speaker, I rose principally to deal with the misstatements of the Right Hon. the Premier. I did feel moved this afternoon and wondered whether justice and truth would eventually pre- vail, or whether misrepresentation and distortion of facts must always obtain. The right honour- able gentleman told us this afternoon that the Harbour Board inserted in a clause of the Bill called "The Wellington Harbour Board and Corporation Empowering Bill " provision to en- able it to take land which was not required for dock purposes Because, forsooth, it lay to landward of Victoria Street and the Railway- station, therefore it could not be used for dock purposes. Is that not what the right honour- Would this House be able gentleman said ? surprised to learn that there is an inviolable agreement between the honourable gentleman's Government and the Wellington Harbour Board empowering the Board to alter the railway and the public road right through the land in ques- tion, in order that their dock might take the place of the site occupied by his railway and the public road? Why could he not put his pre- sentment to the House in a way that was fair, and would not be misleading ? Mr. SEDDON .- That had nothing whatever to do with it when the Bill was introduced. Mr. HUTCHESON .- I say that when the Bill was introduced the Board's intention was revealed as clear as day ; but perhaps it may  not be inappropriate that I should recapitulate shortly the history of the negotiations between the two local bodies alluded to to-day. The Wellington Harbour Board had as an endow- ment a block of land known as the Hunter Street Block, upon which are certain ware- houses -amongst others, Sargood, Son, and Ewen's, Bannatyne and Co.'s, the Queen's Chambers, and others-and which, so far as the revenue is concerned, the Harbour Board re- tains till 1907. The right to reclaim the Te Aro foreshore was vested in the Wellington City Corporation at a time when the Wellington City Corporation managed the harbour affairs of the City of Wellington. After the City Cor- poration had ceased to manage the affairs of the harbour, and having no longer any interest in reclaiming the Te Aro foreshore, it was con- sidered desirable that that power should be transferred to the Wellington Harbour Board. In the beginning of 1897 there was an agree- ment arrived at between the two corporate bodies, which ultimately eventuated in the preparation of and the mutual agreement to this very extensive deed of transfer contained in Schedule A of the Wellington Harbour Board and Corporation Empowering Act of 1898. Therein it is specifically set forth that the Wel- lington Harbour Board will make over and con- vey to the Wellington City Corporation that block of land known as the Hunter Street Block in exchange for the right to reclaim the area foreshore, over and above the land which the Wellington City Corporation was entitled to grant to the Harbour Board for the dock site. The granting to the Harbour Board of the dock site was always a condition of the right to re- claim the foreshore incumbent upon the Welling- ton Corporation. In the preparing of the Bill between the two bodies, and in order to extend the dock beyond the originally decided length, so as to meet the increased size of our shipping, it would be necessary to trench still further to the landward of the five-acre block known as the dock-site block. In order to do that it was necessary to deviate or deflect the present Te Aro Railway Extension, and also the adjacent road known as Victoria Street, so that when the road and railway is in the new position they will form, together with the old position, the upper limbs of a letter Y, and so leave the Har- bour Board the necessary increased length for the dock. Mr. SEDDON .- That is the reason why. Mr. HUTCHESON .- And I want to ask the Premier the reason why, if he knew what he was talking about, did he so disingenuously mislead the House as to the true reasons for the acquisition of the Grainger Street block ? I want to convince the Premier as to the im- propriety of his being a coadjutor of those who are seeking to subvert the principle that he is always contending for. He has bewailed to the House that when the Government go before a Compensation Court they always go to the wall, and he ought to appreciate the position of local bodies, who, unfortunately, are also so treated. The overlapping of the road and the railway upon the block of land known as the Grainger Street block would have cut into certain sec- tions of land at a long acute angle, leaving small patches of land that would be absolutely valueless to the owner or to the Harbour Board. An Hon. MEMBER .- Why not put it into the Bill in the first instance ? Mr. HUTCHESON .- It always was in the Bill, and I am coming to that now, and I say that the Premier stands convicted of having no grounds for the threatening and vindictive abuse which he gratuitously hurled at the Wellington Harbour Board this afternoon, or that he did it with malice prepense. It was ungenerous and most unbecoming language that the Premier used towards the Wellington Harbour Board this afternoon, and I want to demonstrate the fact. But to continue my narrative : Both of the local bodies came to a mutual conclusion that it was desirable in the interests of public health and morality, and for every reason, that that natural silt-pit, wherein were huddled rows of unwholesome hutches, many of them used for immoral purposes-where, among other things, a man had his face cut open with a lemonade bottle in the broad light of day - should be wiped clean off the face of Wel- lington. The whole block lay in a depression of the land, several feet, in fact, below the level of the surrounding streets, and whenever there was 
<page:68>
hovels taken out on men's backs and in boats. Typhoid was there rampant : and of what use was the great and extensive schemes of sani- tary drainage for the City of Wellington so long as that sink remained ? With the full know- ledge of the responsibilities that lay upon them both local bodies said. " We must remove it, and here is the opportunity. Get power to take such a block. First of all, remove the rabbit-hutches that are there now, in order that you may fill up the sections to the level of the permanent roadways, so that you may reroad it. Then it can be cut up into areas to suit the public convenience." That was in the Bill ; and not only had the House a set of most elaborate plans, but an invitation was sent to the whole of the House to inspect the locality, and the members of the Local Bills Committee were taken in cabs at the expense of the Board to the site, so that they might see the insanitary squalor of the whole surroundings. And vet the Premier says this afternoon that the Har- bour Board got the power surreptitiously and broke faith with Parliament, and dishonestly subverted the purposes of the Act for their own speculative purposes. Surely he must be mea- suring the Board's corn by his own bushel. Mr. SEDDON .- I say it again. Mr. HUTCHESON .- Yes, unfortunately, we are accustomed to the Premier's method of bluffing his way out of a false position when he is fairly cornered. Now, what happened in the Legislative Council was this : The whole of the subsections of clause 11 were put in there with- out any wish for them on the part of the Board,  and rather than face the possibility of having the Bill stuck up, and seeing that there was so much dependent upon it, the Harbour Board made a virtue of necessity and accepted the amendments. The first subsection of section 11 compels the Harbour Board to divest itself of all the land over and above what is necessary for dock purposes within nine years. It is clear that the Board had no intention of making this a profit-earning speculation, although the Premier has told us that sach was the Board's sinister intention. The real facts are that the Board has every prospect of losing 930,000 over the acquisition of the land. How does that tally with the demand that the poor man should have a special Bill brought in to enable him to get behind the Court of final appeal. And here is a point I want to emphasize : that the Prime Minister, above all men, should be the first to put forth a hand to shake institutions whose integrity, we say, should be inviolable. I refer to his threat this afternoon to introduce a Bill practically to upset the decision of a Court of final appeal-namely, the Compensation Court. It will react on him and on every department of the Government in the acquisition of land under the Public Works Act. Private citizens will then be able to go over the head of the de- cisions of the Compensation Court dealing with the acquisition of land for public purposes by the Government. To go on, however : that area Mr. Hutcheson ponny in rates to the city. So much were the Council impressed with the integrity and up- rightness of the Board that they got this sub- section (2) put in. That subsection is as fol- lows :--- "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in ' The Rating Act, 1894,' and any amend- ments thereof, or 'The Municipal Corporations Act. 1886,' and any amendments thereof, the lands taken under this section shall not be liable to pay any rates whatever to the Corpora- tion so long as they shall remain the property of the Board, and not be let or leased." To the best of my knowledge, only one single section has been dealt with by the Board. and, tinding themselves unable to permanently sell to the applicant, they have made a provisional arrangement which will tide him over till such time as they are able to fmally sell. That was to enable a three-story building to be erected by a tradesman in Courtenay Place. The piece of land was contiguous to his own section, and enabled him to enlarge his frontage in return for a slice that was taken off his Allen Street frontage. With that single exception. I believe the Board are deriving no revenue from that land; and the Board is under the compulsion of law to divest itself of every vestige of that land within nine years. But if the Premier were the broad-minded, unselfish, beneficent statesman that he would have us believe, he would say to the Harbour Board, " If you make proposals to us asking for legislation enabling you to retain the balance of that area for the purpose of building workmen's homes thereon, and for no other purpose, I will promote and assist legisla- tion that will enable you to do that in return for the consideration it has cost you." That would be something like a statesman's attitude. Mr. SEDDON .- Make it a recreation reserve. Mr. HUTCHESON .- We know the Premier, and the fatherly regard he has for Wellington and its institutions ; but. worse luck, he cannot stand the resistance of the Wellington people. They are a stiff-necked and rebellious race, who decline to allow him to bully them, and there is trouble because the Premier cannot mani- \- pulate and run Wellington and its institutions ; he therefore loses no opportunity to have a fling at the city when he has the power. But I say that if ever a speech was made by the Premier which was unwarranted, and which misrepresented and distorted the facts, it was the speech he made this afternoon in connection with the alleged dishonesty of the Wellington 1 Harbour Board in connection with this legisla- tion. There was nothing in any of these three Arts which did not receive the best, mest un- selfish, and the most keen consideration from the members of the Joint Committee of the two bodies for a period of over two years. They gave more time unselfishly, more thought unselfishly, to the welfare of this city in connection with those three Bills than the Premier has ever given or is ever likely to give to New Zealand during the whole of his political career. Mind, I

represent, but I if were to allow his statements bodies had absolutely nothing personal to gain to go unchallenged, if I were to allow it to go -not even position, place, or power. What they did they did for the benefit of the whole on record that I had said that I was going to community, and with the full knowledge of the promote a Bill to give these people who had a people interested. And I say again that those grievance a right of appeal, I should not be doing justice to myself. I will repeat now what people who surreptitiously petitioned Parlia- I said.

Again, the honourable member misrepresented me, because he said, first of all, proceedings was carefully withheld from the Harbour Board. And, if I mistake not, it was that I had personal feeling in this matter. There has been no personal feeling on my part. not my colleague Mr. Fisher who asked that the Committee's report be read. My recollec- I simply say I did this as a matter of duty. Why should I have any personal feeling? I tion is that I happened to come in in the nick of look on the Wellington Harbour Board as one time, when the report was about to be smuggled on the table. and I asked that it be read. The of the best Harbour Boards in the colony, and honourable member for Palmerston has alluded I look upon its chief officer as superior to any one else in that position in the colony. Why to the poor persecuted man who only asked for #10 :00 for his little holding, and he got some should I have any personal feeling in the mat- $1.200 from the Compensation Court. ter? I have said, and I repeat, that the Bill He was brought in and passed, including the three refused an offer of 41,100 from the Harbour Board, and he would probably have received subsections of clause 11- $1.5 % if he had been amenable to reason and approached the matter in a spirit of equity and good faith. His interests at the Compensation honourable member has proved that this piece Court were most ably represented by Mr. of land is not wanted by the Harbour Board.

And the legislation. wind-up of the honourable gentleman was that An Hon. MEMBER .- NO. by this the Harbour Board lost $0,000.

Task this House again, Is that any evidence I said distinctly that it was only in case of of bad faith or intention to deceive the House ? grave injustice being done to them the Bill I riterate that, instead of making money out should be passed ; 1 prefixed my remarks by of the transaction. they will in all probability that. ive a large sum by the transaction. In con- clasion. I ask again, Is the Premier going to charge of the Bill, to explain to the House that allow his feelings of hatred to Wellington and the honourable member for Wellington City her institutions to obscure his judgment and (Mr. Hutcheson) is in error in saying that the care him to say that which is not in accord- loss to the Board would be something like ance with fact ? I repeat that the Board has no other object than the promotion of the public made of possible loss is between $9,000 and weal. and to properly discharge its duties as a Beard. The members of the Board have no personal interests to serve; they are not of being accused of pohing my nose into things .. actuated by animus or personal bias; they are simply doing what they believe to be their duty. I trust that the Premier will do nothing thing of what I intended to say has been said rashly in gratification of personal revenge that will prevent them from discharging their duty (Mr. Hutcheson). I intend to remark on the flaw as efficiently as they have done in the past. in the arguments of the honourable member in Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- I do not think charge of the Bill when he said he was a repre- An Hon.

The largest estimate that could be $10.000. Mr. BARCLAY (Dunedin City) .- At the risk that do not concern me, I will venture to say a word or two in connection with this Bill. Some- by the honourable member for Wellington City 
<page:70>
Mr. WILFORD .- I said I hoped I was. Mr. BARCLAY .-- Well, I believe the general opinion is that you are. But, as the honour- able member for Wellington City said, the honourable gentleman may not occupy a seat on the Harbour Board for ever ; there may be various reasons why he should have to resign, and a more unsatisfactory member may be appointed. At all events, in the meantime he is nominated by the Government -- that is his position at present. I think it is right and proper that these men -- a very considerable number of them, running into hundreds, I believe -employed by the Board, who have to submit to everything that is told them, if the Chamber of Commerce and other bodies inter- ested in the harbour are represented on the Board, should have a representative also. I should like, also, to say a word as to the reasons why I think it inadvisable to alter the date of the closing of the Board's financial year. It has been already pointed out by the Premier that it would be a serious disarrangement of things that the years of the Harbour Boards should not be the same, so that their statis- tics would not be comparable. It is very objectionable that one Board should have its accounts closing at one date and every other Board at another date. It may be that this is the best date on which to close the accounts, but, if so, let it embrace all other Harbour Boards. The reasons given for the clause say the present date is at the height of the wool season, and this renders it difficult to prepare complete accounts ; and you would naturally expect, if the accounts closed at the date which the Board proposes, there would be a considerable difference in the figures between those closing as they do now on the 31st De- cember and those closing on the 30th Septem- ber. The Board itself furnishes the answer. In its report for last year they give two tables : they give the wool and skins exports for ten years-from 1890 to 1900-on the 31st December basis, and also a table on the 30th September basis, and when you come to compare the two there is only, comparatively speaking, a few bales difference. Take the figures for 1900, for instance, on the 31st December basis: the number of bales was 120,708; for the year closing on the 30th September the number was 125,346-practically a difference of less than 5,000 bales. Take the 1899 period : the num- ber was 107,438 on the 31st December basis, and on the 30th September basis, 108,988-a difference of only about 1,500 bales. In 1896, on the December basis, the number was 99,569, and on the September basis it was 96,223-only about 3,000 difference. It seems to me for such a small difference as this it is hardly worth while making the accounts different from all the rest of the colony. The question, "That the Bill be now read a third time," was negatived. On the question, "That the Bill be recom- mitted for the purpose of considering clause 5," Mr. Barclay that clause be recommitted clause 4 will also have to be considered, clause 4 reading as fol- lows : " The Board shall, on and after the tenth day of February, one thousand nine hundred and two, consist of eleven members." Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) .- I should like to know whether the honourable member for the Suburbs consents to the recommittal to increase the number of the Board. I understood him to be in charge of the Bill. Mr. WILFORD .- The honourable member for Bruce is pleased to be facetious. I am still prepared to stand by the Bill in its entirety. Mr. SEDDON .- My vote will be for recom- mitting clause 7. Mr. WILFORD .- I am prepared to agree if the House consents to the excising of clause 7; but in regard to clause 5, I cannot agree. The House divided on the question, "That clause 7 be recommitted." AYES, 27. Napier Allen, E. G.

Mr. SPEAKER .- The House has decided that the Bill shall not be now read a third time, and it has rejected both amendments for the recommittal of two clauses. The only course now is for the honourable member to ask if the House will consent to allow the third reading to be fixed for Thursday next. Mr. WILFORD .- Perhaps honourable mem- bers will consent to allow me to move it now. Mr. SPEAKER .- It cannot be read a third time no ., as the House has already refused that. I think the honourable member will have to be satisfied if the House will allow the third reading to be set down for Thursday next. Consent was given to allow the third reading to be set down accordingly. PATEA HARBOUR BILL. Mr. HASELDEN (Patea) .- In the absence of the honourable member for Hawera I have been asked to take charge of this Bill. I did not expect to have charge of a Bill so soon after taking my seat in the House, but I wish to say a few words with regard to the Patea Harbour. It is not a very large harbour, but it is a very use- ful one. A great amount of produce is sent out  of this particular harbour, especially now that we have so large an export of butter. An enormous quantity of butter is sent via this harbour to Wellington, and so are quantities of wool, tallow, and preserved meat. The history of the harbour is this : In 1878 the sum of $10,000 was borrowed to improve the harbour, and that was expended under supervision in accordance with plans prepared by Sir John Coode. This sum of $10,000 was very judiciously expended, and improved the harbour very considerably. Later on a further sum of $5,000 was borrowed, and of this £3,000 has been expended ; but £5,000 has also been expended out of the ordinary revenue of the harbour in improving it, showing conclusively that the harbour is returning a very large amount of revenue; and it is ex- pected that with increased facilities the revenue return will be even greater than it is now. The Bill before the House asks permission to borrow £10,000 for further expenditure. We are not asking Parliament for any assistance, except for permission to borrow money and to pay for it ourselves. The revenue will meet the whole of the interest necessary, and a little more. Be- sides, as I have stated, £5,000 has already been paid out of revenue for the improvement of the harbour. The total sum now to be ex- pended is #25,000, and the revenue derived will amount to £1,910, leaving a margin of £535 above the amount required for interest. I think I need say little more. This harbour is outside the harbour and go direct to London. I move the second reading of the Bill. Mr. SEDDON .- In seconding the proposal I do so because I know positively that the har- bour improvements are badly wanted at Patea. After what has been spent something more must be done, otherwise what has been already spent will not give that benefit residents of the district are entitled to expect. There is some- thing wanting in the Bill, and that is the plan of the proposed works. That has not been deposited with the Minister of Marine. An Hon. MEMBER. - It was put before the Local Bills Committee. Mr. SEDDON .- Did the Local Bills Com- mittee have the plan of these works before them, or the previous one? Will the honour- able member answer that question ? That is just one of the defects. It was not deposited. An Hon. MEMBER .- It was produced before the Local Bills Committee. Mr. SEDDON .- The old plan. Mr. GRAHAM .- The new general plan. Mr. SEDDON .- We shall get at it by-and-by. What I claim is that in respect to the expendi- ture of money on harbour-works we ought to have had the plans submitted. That is all I claim-that it speaks in general terms :- "The Patea Harbour Board (hereinafter re- ferred to as ' the Board "), constituted under the said Act, shall have power from time to time to borrow, in the manner and subject to the con- ditions of the said Act, upon the security of all lands vested in the Board or set aside as endow- ments, and of any works constructed or being constructed under any Acts heretofore in force, and of all other property or income of the Board, all such sums of money as may be necessary for the purpose of constructing or repairing harbour-works within the Harbour or Port of Patea." Now, the words there are "constructing or repairing " within the Patea district, or within the Harbour Board district, to the extent of £10,000. I know the works they propose to construct are necessary. I know that they are in accordance with Sir John Coode's plans, and they were subsequently reported upon and ap- proved by Mr. Thomson, who is now the har- bour engineer at Greymouth, so if there is any objection taken by the Crown as to the pro- posed works we know the lines that they intend to go on-that they are as recommended by Sir John Coode, and that they are as approved by Mr. John Thomson; consequently, the £10,000, in my opinion, is necessary, if you are to put anything there at all. But my only fear is that they would not have enough money. As to the necessity, I think we all admit that. As to the plans, of course, that is a matter that can be seen to afterwards. This last plan.and re- port, I understand, are from Mr. Reynolds. Mr. GRAHAM .- The plan for a new work was prepared by Mr. Leslie Reynolds. Mr. SEDDON .- Well, with Sir John Coode's plans, with the extension under Mr. John

said the work can be done for €10,000, he is generally careful, and his work generally comes out pretty near to his estimates. Not long ago the coastal steamer got ashore, and there is great risk until some improvements are made in the harbour. I can assure the House, there- fore, under these circumstances, that they will i the debate on this Bill to close without saying a do well to pass the Bill. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) .- Sir. I have much pleasure in supporting the second read- ing of this Bill. I know the district well, and I also know a good number of its settlers, who formerly were residents of Wellington. I have had special representations made to me from persons in business in the Patea district as to the necessity and the great desirability of carrying out this work. The people of Patea have. in the person of Mr. Mckenna, a very energetic and enterprising Chairman of the Harbour Board. The district is notable for its productive power, and these harbour-works are greatly needed to give the district an outlet for its products. There may be some feeling that the Patea Harbour works are calculated to sap the trade of the New Plymouth and Wanganni Harbour Boards, but really there ought to be no jealous rivalry of the kind. The settlers of Patea are as much entitled to a seaboard outlet for their products as any other part of the colony. It is a great drawback to that part of the country that they should have no port. and, if the money asked for will provide the necessary shipping facilities, we ought to give them the opportunity of borrowing the money. Knowing, as I do, so much of this district --  having so frequently passed through all parts of that country -- knowing its great productive power, and knowing the great desire of the gentlemen who compose the Harbour Board   there. I was glad to hear the remarks of the Premier, who has offered in the most generous manner to support the passing of the Bill. I am sorry I have not with me the particulars I received from a friend whose interests are bound up in the Patea district. I unfor- tunately left his letters at home, not expecting that the Bill would come up this afternoon. Sir, I have great pleasure in supporting the motion for the second reading of the Bill, and I hope in the interests of the Patea district it will become law this session. Mr. SEDDON (Premier). - When I rose just now I was under the impression that accord- ing to the original Act of 1878, or the general Harbours Act. a plan of the proposed work was required to be deposited with the Government ! gentleman who is in charge of the Bill, and who three months beforehand. That plan has not been deposited. It was taken, of course, on the main plan laid before the Local Bills Committee. The section of the Act of 1833 allows the plan to be deposited by order of the Governor in Council. . But I think the difficulty has been got over : and, as for the plan going before the Committee, there was a plan before the Local Bills Committee, and therefore it has done its duty so far as it was concerned ; but the plan that I ing, when he said that local Bills were allowed Mr. Seddon mittee it was plainly pointed out that the measure did not authorise the construction of the works, and therefore the objection that it was not deposited three months prior to the session practically falls to the ground. Mr. WILLIS (Wanganui) .- I should not like few words. I have known the Harbour of Patea for the last thirty or forty years, and I am quite satisfied that the improvements suggested will be of great benefit to that district. 1 am also satisfied that the money expended there already has been well spent, and it only requires the outlay of some further money to make it a good harbour. I only wish, myself, that it was a question of our own harbour improvement that was in contemplation. Although we re- quire money for our own harbour, still 1 can give my support to other harbours, and, although I naturally regard things from our own standpoint, I would be very pleased in- deed to see Patea afforded the opportunity of sending away the produce of the surrounding district from that port. There is another thing I should like to say. I think a great part of the prosperity of the colony is due to the large number of harbours we have, by means of which our exports may be carried away profitably, instead of our having to go to a large expendi- ture for the purpose of conveying them to the large centres. I know there has been a feeling often in Wellington that it is the natural centre, and that everything should drift to and be distributed from Wellington. But. friendly as we are, and much as we would wish to see Wellington prosper, I think it is quite right. that we should push forward the improvement. of our own local harbours, by means of which our produce can be carried away most profit- ably, to the advantage of our farmers and our- selves. Mr. TANNER (Avon) .- Sir, I was 7.30. about to remark at half-past five, when the House adjourned, that the honour- able member for Wanganui had apparently not finished his remarks, but was under a misap- prehension when he sat down, and I was pro- posing to give way that he might conclude anything he might desire to add, but I find that on reassembling he is not present. What has struck me during the few words that have been said with regard to this local Bill this afternoon is the small amount of information that has been vouchsafed to the House. It is a most unfortunate matter that the honourable introduced it, should have been, I suppose, un- wittingly absent at the time it was called on, so that the measure fell into the hands of a new colleague, who probably may or may not be acquainted with the position, and who has apparently been taken unawares in moving the second reading. No one, of course, wishes to criticize the honourable gentleman, but it struck me that the words of the Premier this morn- 
<page:73>
before the day passed. What does the House as a whole know of the position of the Patca Harbour Board ? I have myself endeavoured to glean all the information attainable, and I find it is meagre and scanty. I find that the Harbour Board was intrusted some years ago with nearly four thousand acres of land as endowments. We have not been informed what revenue is derived from those endowments, or whether. like a neighbouring Harbour Board -the Wanganui Harbour Board-it has suc- ceeded in selling them and spending the pro- ceeds. Hon. MEMBERS .- Oh ! Mr. TANNER .- Honourable members say " Oh." but it is a fact that the General Government endowed the Wanganui Har- bour Board with 25,000 acres of land, the whole of the freehold of which has been sold and the money spent. I remember, in 1892, when the last Bill was passed through this House giving power to sell the last remnants of the 25,000 acres, and at the time I called attention to the fact. Sir, I find the Patea Board has had large borrowing-powers extended to it in the past. In 1878 power was given to borrow $10,000), and in 1890 power was given to borrow a further $5,000. I should have been glad to hear from the honourable member who moved the second reading how far the Board has used its powers of borrowing : whether any large amount has been borrowed. Mr. PIRANI .-- It has all been borrowed. Mr. GRAHAM .- No ; $13,000 out of $15,000. Mr. TANNER .- Well, at any rate, no mem- ber wishes to stand in the way of the develop- ment of any portion of the colony. Our large harbours have been a success. Some of the secondary harbours have not been the success the people of New Zealand might have wished. and a good deal of useless and unnecessary expense has been incurred, casting burdens on the people for many years to come, which money has been, to all intents and purposes. wasted in some instances. I do not say that this applies to the Patea Board. I remember seeing the works some years ago, and they reminded me of the pictures we generally see in good books of the ruins of Tyre and Sidon on the Mediterranean coast. There were a few blocks of concrete standing above the level of the water, but the whole place had a dismantled and forlorn look, and is the most wretched spot one could conceive. But, Sir. things may have changed since then; I hope they have, but it would have been well if the honourable gentleman who moved the second reading had given the House some assurance. and some knowledge of the details, and whether it is likely, if the House passes this Bill giving further borrowing-powers, that the expenditure of the money will be carried out with somewhat greater degree of wisdom than has characterized the expenditure of such moneys in the past. ] feel that we pass many of these Bills far too lightly. The member for a district just intro- duces a Bill. He takes up the attitude that the from one member to another ; and, partly out of sympathy, and partly from indifference or a wish not to take any trouble in the matter, members assent to a Bill which, on reflection and thought, they would rather blame them- selves for sanctioning. I appeal to the honour- able gentleman who has introduced the Bill, in his reply, to submit some further knowledge to the House than what it at present possesses with regard to the Patca Harbour Board. Mr. GRAHAM (Nelson City) .- Sir, as a member of the Local Bills Committee, to whom this Bill was referred, I feel it incumbent on me to speak a few words in explanation as to the position of this Bill. With reference to the merits, pro- visions, and particulars of the Bill, and as to how the money which the promoters of the Bill desire power to borrow is to be spent, and what it is going to be spent on, I say nothing. I leave that to the honourable member in charge of the Bill, who represents the district. My concern is with reference to the Bill as reported from the Local Bills Committee, and as to whether the Standing Orders have been complied with. The Right Hon. the Premier this afternoon, with- out one atom of knowledge of the subject, in supporting the second reading of the Bill made an apology for the Standing Orders not having been complied with, inasmuch as a plan had not been deposited with the Marine Department, as required by clause 148 of the Harbours Act. That, Sir, in the face of the Committee having reported to the House that the Standing Orders had been complied with, renders it necessary for me to make some explanation on the subject. This Bill, Sir, was referred to the Local Bills Committee in the ordinary way. When it came before the Committee there was a plan attached to the Bill. li the Bill had provided for carry- ing out the works that were shown upon the plan that was attached to it, the Bill would have been absolutely barred by clause 148 of ". The Harbours Act. 1878," which says,- " No land shall be reclaimed from the sea or in any harbour, and no graving-deck, dock, or breakwater shall be constructed in any har- bour or in the sea, except under the authority of a special Act ; and the applicants for such special Act shall, three months at least before the session of the General Assembly at which such Act is sought to be obtained, deposit at the office of the Marine Department a plan." And so on. No plan had been deposited with the Marine Department, therefore, as I said just now, if the Bill had provided for the plan that accompanied the Bill before the Local Bills Committee being given effect to it would have been completely barred by that omission. It has been stated by the honourable member for Avon that local Bills are passed far too lightly by the House. I can assure the honourable member and the House that the Local Bills Committee gave this particular Bill a great deal of attention. They not only considered it on one occasion, but they adjourned it for a week for the purpose of 
<page:74>
reference to it. I found that no plan had been deposited ; but it was apparent, when we investi- gated into the merits of the Bill, that it made no provision for giving effect to any particular work as defined on the plan that accompanied it, and no reference to any plan is made in the Bill. It is a borrowing Bill pure and simple. It is, in fact, in its operative clauses a fac- simile, word for word, of the borrowing Bill of 1890, under which the Patea Harbour Board borrowed $5,000 to continue the work they had previously being carrying on, and for which they had obtained $10,000 in 1878. On that occasion no plan was deposited, and no plan was re- quired, because it was a borrowing Bill. The Marine Engineer informed me that Mr. Leslie Reynolds's plan is absolutely a new work, and that it could not, under any circum- stances, be considered as a continuation of the work recommended by Sir John Coode. It could not even be called a modification of such work. It is absolutely a new work. Therefore, if this Bill is passed the people of Patea may borrow ±10,000 ; they may pay in- terest upon it, and keep it locked up in a chest or a bank, but they may not spend it on the work they propose until other public steps have been taken. If the $10,000 they ask for power to borrow now is for the purpose of continuing the work which was formerly authorised, then it may be proceeded with without the depositing of a new plan for three months, as provided in clause 148 of the principal Act. They may in that case proceed under clause 4 of the amend- ing Act of 1893. It is not a conflict of statutes, as the Premier stated. Clause 4 of the Act of 1883 is a modification of clause 148 of the original Act, and provides that after they have borrowed this #10,000, if they are in a position to show that it is in continuation of a. work previously authorised, then the Governor in Council may grant authority under certain con- ditions. Clause 4 of the 1883 Act says,- " Whenever any Harbour Board is desirous of executing or constructing any harbour-works upon lands vested in such Board or upon lands of the Crown of such a nature that the same could, under the said Act, only be carried out and executed under the authority of a special Act, the Board may apply to the Governor in Council for a special order, and, if the Governor in Council thinks fit, such order may be made and granted, subject to the terms and condi- tions hereinafter prescribed." Then follow eight or nine long subsections of the clause, which I need not read in full, but I will give the details of them : Before the works can be carried out the Board shall submit to the Minister a plan showing details of the proposed work. The Board shall deposit copies of such plan at the Customhouse or other public office in the locality where the work is to be carried out for public inspection. The Board shall give notice in writing to all persons whose lands may be injuriously affected by the construction of the proposed works. Such notice must state Mr. Graham local newspaper once in each of four consecu- tive weeks. Objections in writing may be lodged with the Minister against the carrying- out of the proposed works. After duly consider- ing all such objections, the Governor in Council may grant a special order authorising the con- struction of the works asked for in the manner prescribed by Act, and the works so authorised must be specially mentioned and described in the authority given. Now, all these things will have to be done before the money sought to be raised by the borrowing Bill can be expended. Therefore there is ample protection for every one concerned. If this Bill had been, as I have already said, anything more than a simple borrowing Bill, the Local Bills Committee would not have given instruc- tions to report it to the House as having com- plied with the Standing Orders. But there is nothing to show that the money has to be spent on any new work, and before that money can be spent, if they borrow it, they have got to do all the things I have just now stated. If the honourable member for Avon will accept my assurance, together with my explanation, he will, I think, feel satisfied that local Bills, when they are referred by the House to the Local Bills Committee, are really carefully considered. The honourable member for Palmerston says " Hear, hear," and he is in a position to speak from personal knowledge, because he was pre- sent when this Bill was under consideration by the Committee. He spoke a few words this afternoon. Of course, he knew the position, and he knows to some extent at least the trouble which was taken by the Local Bills Committee with reference to the Bill which is before the House. I am very glad that the honourable gentleman happened to be there to see how careful the Committee is with refer- ence to any recommendations they make to this House. I would not report to this House that the Standing Orders had been complied with unless I felt convinced in my own mind that they had been complied with. I hope, Sir, after this explanation, members will not think for one moment that local Bills are not dealt with effectively by the Committee to whom they are referred. I do not, as a rule, think it my business to take up the time of the House with discussing local Bills after they have been reported upon. The Committee in. vestigates and deals with them, and when I have, by direction of the Committee, reported that a Bill has complied with the Standing Orders, and, when necessary, on the merits of the Bill, I am satisfied without saying any more. The Premier this afternoon, in reference to the report of the Committee, without any know- ledge of the subject, took upon himself to say that the Standing Orders had not been com- plied with. I do hope the right honourable gentleman knows more about the many import- ant policy measures that he brings forward and expounds upon to the House than he knew about this Bill, otherwise he would not be in a 
<page:75>
Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister for Public Works) .- I think every honourable member can bear testimony to the great care which the last speaker exercises in every matter that comes before him. Honourable members know, of course, the attention he gives to every matter that comes before this House, and they can readily understand that, as Chairman of the Local Bills Committee, much greater care and responsibility is cast upon him. On that Com- mittee I can assure honourable members that he acts as our guide, philosopher, and friend. But. Sir, I should not have risen but for a re- mark dropped by the honourable member that no work would be undertaken under this Bill unless it came before the House again. Now, I should not like any member of the House to misunderstand the position. The Premier said, and correctly said, there was a conflict between the Act of 1878 and the Act of 1883. One of those Acts prescribes that no work shall be undertaken unless plans of the work are de- posited with the Marine Department three months before the meeting of Parliament. Well, in this case the Chairman of the Local Bills Committee has informed you-and, of course, we know what he states is correct- that the Bill could not have proceeded under the Act of 1878. But there is a conflict between the two Acts, inasmuch as the Act of 1883 allows the work to be done. This being simply a borrowing Bill, then the local body is to have its plans prepared and sub- mitted to the Marine Department, advertised in the local papers for a certain time, all the  local bodies interested are to be notified, and then only when the Order in Council is issued can the work be proceeded with. There was some doubt in the mind of the Chairman and others as to what was the intention of the pro- moters of the Bill ; and when we were waited upon by the Chairman, Mr. McKenna, and the secretary, they made the matter very clear to us, and I can assure the House that, so far as the forms of the House having been complied with, they need have no hesitation in allowing the Bill to proceed. Then, as to the nature of the work, I know something about Patea, and something about the enterprise of its in- habitants. I know something about the needs of the district, and I know that that district, and from there on to New Plymouth, is one of the most prosperous parts of the colony, and I agree with the honourable member for Wa- nganui, who says it behoves us to enable those people to tax themselves in order to carry out the required works. I believe this will be of . great service to the town, and I hope honourable members will allow the Bill to proceed. Major STEWARD (Waitaki) .- I do not rise to oppose the Bill, Sir. On the contrary, I am quite prepared to support it. But I wish to draw the attention of the honourable gentleman in charge of the Bill to the fact that there is an omission in its provisions, which should be supplied in Committee. Of late years, in all borrowing Bills that have passed this House, be borrowed. Last session we passed a Bill relating to Westport Harbour, and another relating to Greymouth Harbour, and in both of them this proviso occurs :- " But no money shall be borrowed under the authority of this Act which shall produce to the lender a higher rate of interest than four pounds per centum per annum, anything in the last-mentioned Act notwithstanding." Then, in the Dunedin City and Suburban Tramways Bill the limit was made 5 per cent. It is quite possible that in the case of a small loan such as is proposed to be authorised by this Bill 5 per cent. would be the limit inserted in Committee. It is quite clear that, unless the House is going to depart from the rule that it has laid down during the last several ses- sions, it will be necessary for the honourable gentleman to accept, or himself incorporate in Committee, a clause limiting the price at which debentures may be sold. Mr. T. MACKENZIE (Waihemo). - This question of harbour expenditure is one that I think the House should exercise very consider- able discretion in connection with. I believe, however, so far as Patea Harbour is concerned, that that is a modest work, and will probably repay interest on expenditure; and from all that we have heard to-night there is every justification for this measure going on, subject, of course, to the very important provision which has been so ably laid before the House by the honourable member for Waitaki, the Hon. Major Steward. I took a very keen interest at the time of the discussion before the House re- garding the limit of interest that should be per- I mitted on loans to be raised by local bodies. did that because I recognised that the time was coming when the colony must take over the responsibility of sound harbour loans. It is absurd to think that for all time we shall go on paying 6 per cent., as is the case on many of these loans, of which 90 per cent., and in some cases only 80 per cent., was contributed. I say it is the duty of this House before sanctioning a single loan to see that the expenditure is a wise one, and that adequate revenue will result. If that is so, the colony will come in a very practical way to the rescue of the people who are going in for harbour expenditure. We had the Minister of Marine stating that it was right and proper for the Government to assist the harbour-works; but the greatest assistance that can be extended to local bodies at the present time is to give a guarantee to their loans, which will enable them to gain their money at the lowest rate of interest. And that principle should extend further, and we ought to have the Imperial guarantee behind genuine colonial loans, so that when money is raised for this colony for defence purposes and for other colonial purposes the people of this colony should obtain the money at the lowest possible rate of interest. I regard the proposal suggested by the Hon. Major Steward, that 5 per cent. should be the limit, as far in excess. Now, I do not believe, except in cases 
<page:76>
What is the price of money in the London market at the present time? Did we not see these gilt - edged 23 per cent. British Consols down to $92, a point never reached before? And all these arguments go to prove that what I said ought to be adopted by the House. An honourable gentleman on the left says it is owing to the war. But my financial friend the honourable and able representative for Nelson City says that the price will soon go up again, and I repeat and indorse that. We do not always find that common-sense delivered from that honourable gentleman, and it is only right and proper when we see the honourable gentleman moving along the narrow path of rectitude-which we always hope to see him pursue- that we should commend him, because we thereby encourage him to do the right. Coming back to the point which the honour- able gentleman has tried to wile me away from by his interjection, the point is this : That we should not sanction the raising of loans at the present time, because we shall not get that value that we shall probably get for our money as soon as this unfortunate war is over. Now, Sir, whilst I have not risen for the purpose of opposing this Bill, I am glad to think that the Chairman of the Local Bills Committee has endeavoured to make it a little clearer in the House as to what took place before the Local Bills Committee in connection with this particular Bill, because Standing Order 390, dealing with local Bills, clearly sets forth that the Committee shall be supplied with a state-  ment of the finances of the body, and the works upon which the money is to be expended, and also a map showing the work to be undertaken. The honourable member has been exceedingly severe on the Premier this evening. He has been as bold as a lion in the absence of the Premier. What the Premier said was not based upon that which the honourable member en- deavoured to explain away. What the Premier stated was not that the Standing Orders bad not been complied with, but that a map should be deposited somewhere in the district for a period of three months. An Hon. MEMBER .- - No. Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- It has to be deposited and advertised in the district. Mr. GRAHAM. -- It was deposited in the Magistrate's Court of the district. Mr. T. MACKENZIE. - Very well, why did you question the statement of the Premier ? The Premier said distinctly that there was a map required to be deposited for three months before this Bill can be gone on with, and accord- ing to the Premier, that map was not so de- posited. He did not say that a map did not accompany this Bill when it went before the Local Bills Committee. Therefore the explana- tion of the honourable member, and the courage he has shown on this occasion, was entirely uncalled-for, because the Standing Orders have been complied with, and the Committee recom- mended that the Bill be allowed to proceed. Coming to the question of the propriety of Mr. T. Mackenzie he in that connection instanced the Wanganui Harbour Board. I am sorry that the honour- able member for Wanganui is not in his place to- night. You cannot in the whole of the loan expenditure of this colony find a more flagrant instance of waste of public money than was carried out in connection with that harbour. They raised a sum of something like ¥60,000, and spent the bulk of it in river-works, and after the expenditure took place they dis- covered that, instead of assisting the navigation and increasing the depth of the water in the river, it absolutely reduced the depth of the water. That is a fact. And what are they going to try to do now ? They are endeavouring to raise money for the purpose of making a more efficient harbour ; but it is only for the purpose, after all, of bringing in the little mos- quito fleet which coasts round our shores. Will one of those large cargo-boats which are con- structed for the purpose of taking away the pro- duets of the farmers-wool and frozen mutton -- will one of these steamers be accommodated with 1 in. more water ? They will not. The whole policy of borrowing for further harbour con- struction emanates from the people of the Town of Wanganui. If you appealed to the farmers of the Wanganui district as to whether or not $100,000 was to be literally wasted in the har- bour, and for which they would be taxed without one farthing of benefit, would they assent ? They would not. It is the people in the towns, in order to have the temporary expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds-they advo- cate the expenditure of this money; but the responsibility of the bulk of that expenditure, unfortunately, falls on the farmers in the back districts, and for all time heavier export and import rates will be imposed on the products coming and going into the district, or else a rate will be levied on the district. And, when that comes about, will that assist the 8.0. farmers, as we heard so eloquently put by honourable but irresponsible members this afternoon ? You simply handicap them to a much greater extent, without extending one iota of facility for the export of their produce.  I therefore say, so far as the Wanganni Har- bour is concerned, what this House wants to pass is a Bill to protect people from them- 1 selves-to protect them from the rashness of their own actions -and to take the voice not only of the townspeople on expenditure of this class, but the voice of the producers -- not the consumers and distributors of the townships, i but the producers in the country-as to whether or not this expenditure should be gone on with. Can we have a more glaring instance of waste of money than has occurred in connection with the construction of the so-called harbour-works at Napier ? An Hon. MEMBER .- How about Wellington ? Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- I should like to say this about Wellington : If the expenditure had been carried on in connection with other har- bours under the wise engineering supervision that has characterized the working of the 
<page:77>
nificent ports, and the harbour accommodation is the best in the Southern Hemisphere, and this is largely due to the able men who have composed the Board, and because they allow Mr. Ferguson, their engineer, to wisely domi- nate their expenditure and their operations. But coming to the question of the Napier Har- bour. It was recognised as Bill after Bill went through this House authorising increased ex- penditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds that this money was to be literally wasted -- and it is wasted. They have spent between $500.000 and 9600.000 on the harbour. works, and it does not aid one of these steamers a bit. Not so; they cannot use the protective works or wharves when the weather is in the least rough : and if it cannot be done in rough weather, what is the use of having a fair- weather harbour? And I suppose when these great cargo-steamers and ocean-going tramps to take away the produce of the farmers of the Napier district go to the port not one single ocean-going tramp or cargo-boat ever goes near the wharf. Mr. MILLAR (Dunedin City) .- I rise to a point of order. What has the Port of Napier to do with the Patea Harbour Bill ? Mr. SPEAKER .- I must say I think the honourable gentleman is travelling rather wide of the mark. Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- I always obey the ruling of the Chair. What I wanted to point out to the House is that as imprudent expendi-  ture, and as glaring mismanagement have oc- curred in the past in connection with expendi- ture, and as these mistakes have rather beon made by the people of the towns than the people of the country-if these mistakes have occurred in connection with other harbours, it is reasonable to suppose with the same in- fluences that have been acting in Wanganui -and that I was referring to as being alluded to by the Minister of Marine and the member for Wanganui-that. as these loans have been influenced by the townspeople rather than by the country people, then I contend that the voice of the country people should be taken in preference to that of the townspeople. And the betring on the Harbour of Patea is this : I believe it is the people of the Town of Patea rather than those of the surrounding district who are con- tending that this should be gone on with. If Iam confined to the question of the Patea Harbour I shall go into the finances of that particular harbour, and I shall show that, although they wish for a further expenditure of $10,000, their exports, instead of being an increasing quantity, are diminishing. On page 14 of the published report of the Patea Harbour Board we find that the exports for 1900 amounted to 533,000. whereas the exports for 1599 were $103,208, the difference between those two vears being no less than $20.000. In other words, the exports from that harbour have diminished in one year by $20,000, or 20 per cent. In the year 1593 1897, when the exports were $113,701, which is something like $30,000 above what the exports were for the year 1900. Then, if the exports are diminishing in that ratio, 1 venture the opinion that the agriculturists in that district are either finding another outlet owing to the cheap railway fares that we have heard so much about from the Minister for Railways, or the produce is not there to send away. I hope the honourable gentleman in charge of this measure, when he replies, will give full information in regard to this matter. He will probably point out to us that the sheep pre- viously exported from the Port of Patea are now being bought up by the enterprising meat- freezing company of Wanganui, and are being shipped from the Wanganui works instead of from that port. That may probably account for the diminished exports for 1900, as against those of 1897. We might go back a little further. Take, for instance, the year 1896. We find that the exports then were $123,784. In 1895 they were $108,000, in 1894 €115,000, and in 1893 they were $99,592, so that last year they were $16,000 less than the year 1893. Now, coming to the general account of the Patea Harbour Board, I find that the total revenue was $4,038 Os. 3d., but from that con- siderable items, which really do not stand as revenue, have to be deducted. There is a balance of $1,036, so that the Board's revenue is some- thing like $3,000. Now, in connection with this matter of revenue, I should point out that there is a loan of $13,000, upon which 44 per cent. interest has to be paid. absorbing $585 of the money derived by the Board. And, then, Sir, there are the sinking funds. There is a sinking fund of 24 per cent. on the 410,000, and of 2} per cent. on the $3,000. The sinking fund in the one case absorbs $250, and in the other $75. You will therefore see, if you are going to borrow and to authorise the expen- diture of another $10,000, we ought to ask the Hon. Chairman of the Local Bills Committee to explain, as he has not explained to-night, where that probable revenue is to come from, seeing that the exports during the last six years have enormously decreased. I say the honourable gentleman has not been faithful to his work when he recommended that the Bill should pro- ceed, for he should have shown us clearly and emphatically that not only had he examined the proposed plans, and seen that the Bill had been properly advertised in the district as is provided by law, but he ought to have been pre- pared with figures - - because the honourable gentleman is an authority on figures, and I believe it is within the history of this House that he made one great financial statement here that riveted the attention of the House and was cabled all over New Zealand. However, that is by the way. Mr. GRAHAM .- You ought to be Chairman of the Local Bills Committee. Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- I am an ex-chairman of the Local Bills Committee, and I venture to 
<page:78>
increased revenue is to come from in respect to this further expenditure of £10,000, and until that is clearly shown I say the honourable gentleman has not done his duty. But I venture to think that the honourable member in charge of the Bill will give such an explana- tion to the House as will show that, although the Chairman of the Local Bills Committee has not done his duty faithfully in the Committee, he, at any rate, knows the responsibilities and resources of that district, and will show clearly to the House that it is a right and proper thing that the Bill should pass. Now, there are a few more points that I want to make about this Bill, and they will be chiefly of a financial nature. I regret to think that we have not a statement in this House showing the actual position of the different Harbour Boards of the colony. What occurs here is that year after year each Harbour Board, as the Act requires, places upon the table of the House a statement of its finances, but after they have been laid upon the table of the House no record is kept of them. I have been hunting through the Library to see whether I could obtain these reports, and ascertain what has gone on in connection with the various expen- diture on our harbours, but not one single copy of the reports that from time to time have been laid upon the table of this House is now avail- able. What becomes of them is past my com- prehension. An Hon. MEMBER .- They are in the cellar. Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- I believe they are.   I went to one of the librarians and told him, and he said another had gone home and had taken the key; and the same thing occurred a few nights ago when I wanted to refer to some   agricultural matters. These things ought to be open to members in order that they can go fully into the consideration of the harbour- works and other matters, and give such votes as will be safe and also as will conserve the best interests of the colony. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton). - After the very entertaining address which has been delivered by the versatile member for Waihemo, I fear the few remarks I have to place before the House will fall flat and trite. However, there are one or two points in connection with this Harbour Bill upon which I desire to bang a few remarks. The point that always sur- prises me in connection with Harbour Bills being laid before the House is the rapidity-I might say, the amazing rapidity-with which they have been accepted by the House and passed through. I think the honourable gentle- man was correct in the statement he made that sooner or later all these Harbour Boards' lia- bilities, and especially those of the smaller Har- bour Boards, would fall on the colonial tax- payer, and it is from that standpoint I wish to say a few words. First, as to the rate of interest, which is unlimited in the Bill. I remember very well that last year I appeared before the Mr. T. Mackenzie I remember that then the Local Bills Com- mittee insisted on a clause being inserted that the lender should not be paid more than 4 per cent. for the loan; and I cannot understand why the Local Bills Committee has allowed this Bill to come down permitting the Patea Har- bour Board to pay unlimited interest. I cer- tainly think that when the Bill is in Committee it will be the duty of the House to insert a clause which will bind down the Patea Harbour Board, the same as the Local Bills Committee has bound down other bodies during the last few years, to pay a rate of interest not exceed- ing 4 per cent. in connection with the loan. The large question which is involved in con- nection with these smaller local harbours is the relation that they stand in to our State system of railways. Now, the member for Wanganui spoke almost in terms of ridicule of the idea of the Wellington Harbour being a port for Wanganui and the West Coast harbours and districts. Why, Sir, what other place is there in the colony from which the produce of the fariners of Wanganui and Patea can be better sent to its destination in the markets of the world than the Harbour of Wellington ? The particular point I wish to make is this : All the money that is being spent in connection with these small coastal harbours is not being spent in opposition to the large harbours of the colony, but is rather being spent in opposition to the railways of the colony, for the simple reason that if we had a proper system of rail- way freights, then the whole of the produce that has to go to the London markets in the way of frozen mutton and in the way of butter, instead of being sent in these small vessels from the small bar-harbours, would go along our rail- ways to the ports whence they would be for- warded to the Mother-country, or wherever the markets may be. An Hon. MEMBER .- The direct liners come to Wanganui. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- What is the use of saying that? Do not I remember in the old days, at Wanganui, when they started their harbour-works at Wanganui, they actually began to train the steamers to jump hurdles. They found that the steamers had to go over sand-banks, and mud-banks, and protective works, and they had to train the steamers as steeple-chasers. The vessels that go as direct liners to Wanganui are only intermit- tent, not regular, and freezing-works must get rid of their produce rapidly ; and therefore I repeat that, so far as the harbours of the colorty are concerned, we have to recognise that the two harbours for the North Island are Wellington and Auckland, and that the two harbours for the South Island are Lyttelton and Port Chalmers. Our railway interests must therefore be worked so as to handle the produce from the distant districts, and carry it to the natural ports of debarkation. An Hon. MEMBER .- What about Timaru ? 
<page:79>
the Smithfield mutton is frequently railed to Lyttelton for the purpose of being shipped. It is frequently done on account of the fact that, there being a great many more vessels going to Lyttelton, there is a constant opportunity to forward lamb and mutton for Europe ; whereas at a place like Timaru they can only have a vessel to load occasionally. Experience shows that in almost every great producing country there are two or three large ports which are the natural shipping centres of those countries, and, that being the case, I submit that the policy of this House should be the limiting, as far as possible, the expenditure upon these small bar-harbours; and for that purpose the Government should lay down as the policy for our railways that the products of the colony shall be carried at the cheap fares for long dis- tances that obtain in America or Canada or Australia. Do honourable members know, for example, that we have actually no rate of freight on our railways for frozen meat ? The railway freight for frozen meat is simply for dead meat, and was instituted a number of years ago as a charge for carrying carcases for sale in our cities. Our railways are still backward as far as com- parison is concerned between the freights on frozen mutton charged in New Zealand and the freights charged in Australia. Again, compare our rates with the rates charged in America. There they have to rail wheat long distances, as much as fifteen hundred miles, to the sea- board. An Hon. MEMBER .- Where from ?  Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- From the north- west-the great wheat-growing districts of the United States-and also from Canada. Surely the honourable gentleman knows that much.     If we compare that with the rates charged in our own colony, it will be seen that the key to the situation, so far as prosperity of the farm- ing community of New Zealand is concerned, is in the railway freights that are charged. I therefore say it appears to me that whenever these small harbour questions are raised we have to consider the point of view of competi- tion with the State railways, recognising that the colonial taxpayers must ultimately take the responsibility of these small loans that are now being negotiated. Mr. R. MCKENZIE (Motueka) .- Sir, I did not intend to take any part in the discussion on this Bill, but I desire to say now that I have had two surprises since the discussion on the measure commenced. One is that some honour- able members will not recognise the progressive- ness of which a young colony is capable. The honourable gentleman who spoke last says the meat should be railed from Patea to Wellington ; but what will he say when I inform him that, as a matter of fact, it would be cheaper to ship meat from Buenos Ayres to London than to rail it from Patea to Wellington ? An Hon. MEMBER .- That should not be. Mr. R. MCKENZIE .- No, perhaps not, but it is the fact. Now, I also wish to say this: tion, and I recognised that the amount of money now asked for is necessary to allow certain works to be carried out. Some honourable mem- bers in speaking to-day are probably trying to stonewall some other Bill. However, I think the House should recognise that the work is necessary. There is also the phase of the ques- tion pointed out by the member for Waihemo : that the money ought not to be borrowed at more than 4 per cent. Well, he surely knows that if a clause were put in the Bill to that effect it would render the measure ineffective. There is no analogy between the extensive works at Westport to which he referred and the small works required at Patea. There is no comparison between the two cases. I hope honourable members will now let the Bill go through, especially as it is in the hands of a new member, and if honourable members are trying to block any other Bill let them go straight for it and not block this one. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) .- Mr. Speaker, after what has taken place this afternoon and even- ing, I am inclined to think the proper way to support a Bill is not to get up and make a long speech in favour of it, but rather, especially in the case of a local Bill, to use a well-known expression, to " sit tight," and eventually the measure will get through along with others, and find its way on to the statute-book. I do not think I would have said anything on this Bill if it was not for the desire I have to defend the Local Bills Committee and its Chairman from the imputations cast on them by previous speakers. One honourable member found fault with the Local Bills Committee for allowing this Bill to proceed without having seen that plans in connection with it were deposited for three months, as he said, in the Magistrate's Court in the district concerned. Three months. Why, Sir, if the honourable member will look at the Standing Orders - if he ever read the Standing Orders he would have seen that the specified term is not three months, but three weeks. I do not propose to read the Standing Orders now, because it would waste too much time, but I would simply refer the honourable member to Standing Orders Nos. 383 to 389. Sir, the statement made by the honour- able member shows a very superficial knowledge on his part of the Standing Orders, and I am surprised at such an assertion being made by a gentleman with the parliamentary experience which he possesses. Then, he quoted figures to show that the trade of Patea has been falling off during the last few years. I do not know where the honourable member obtained his figures. If he had looked at the report of the Patea Harbour Board -a copy of which I hold in my hand-he would have seen that in 1887 the exports from Patea amounted to £33,186, and last year the exports amounted to the large sum of $83,927. That is to say, that in the years between 1887 and 1900 the exports had more than doubled, and I venture to say they will go on increasing at an even greater ratio than that recorded for the years I have 
<page:80>
was formerly a member of that Committee, and I have had some experience of its working, and I venture to say there is no Committee of this House which takes so much trouble as this Committee with the business submitted to it, and no Chairman of a sessional Committee who is more painstaking or more conscientious than the Chairman of the Local Bills Committee. think it is necessary, in view of the reflections cast upon him, to make the remarks I have just made. Now, Sir, coming to the Bill, the position of the Patea Harbour Board, as I understand it, is something like this : They have borrowed, in two amounts, €13,000-at one time they borrowed $10,000, and another time $3.000, making, in all, €13,000. But, Sir, their revenue at the present time ex- ceeds their expenditure, and has exceeded it for quite a number of years by nearly $1,000 per annum, so I think they are quite justified in doing what they are doing now-that is, in asking the authority of this House in order to borrow a further loan of $10,000 for the pur- pose of further improvments to their harbour. And, Sir, they are doing what sensible, practical, and progressive people ought to do-they are acting in accordance with the recommendations of one of the most eminent engineers who ever visited this colony-Sir John Coode ; and since he left the colony they have been acting on the advice of another eminent engineer - a Mr. Thomson, I think, at present a resident on the West Coast ; and they are acting in accordance with the plans and advice of these  eminent authorities. Mr. HALL-JONES .- Mr. Leslie Reynolds's plans. Mr. MASSEY .- I have got the report of the Harbour Board here, and I trust I will not be interrupted for a few minutes, and I will lend it to the honourable gentleman when I have finished. Another honourable member who cast reflections on Patea and upon the har- bour there was, I think, the member for Avon. He told us, so far as I can recollect, that when he visited Patea some years ago the harbour- works at Patea reminded him of the ruins of Tyre and Sidon, or of some other Eastern city. It was quite evident from the remarks the honourable member made that he had not seen Patea during the last few years. He must have seen Patea long before the era of the re- frigerator and the separator, and before the country in the neighbourhood of Patea had been occupied by enterprising and prosperous settlers, as it is to-day. I feel quite satisfied that when the Bill goes to a division a majority of honour- able members will be found supporting the Bill. Now, we had fault found with the Local Bills Committee by the honourable member for Waitaki, and I believe by one or two others, for not having inserted a provision in the Bill limiting the rate of interest. Well, I am willing to admit that it was customary for the Local Bills Committee formerly to insert Mr. Massey years so far as the money-market is concerned ? Why, Sir, the Government itself a few years ago were able to borrow at 3 per cent., almost at par. But now they are glad to get money at 4 per cent., when they find it necessary to borrow. Mr. PIRANI .-- The Government paid more I than 4 per cent. this year. Mr. MASSEY .- Yes, they have paid more than 4 per cent. if you take the cost of adver- tising into consideration and the fact that we paid interest before we received the whole of the money. But the same state of things affects local bodies, of which the Patea Harbour Board is one. I do not know what rate of interest they will have to pay, but I have no doubt that the member in charge of the Bill will be willing to accept an amendment defining a reasonable limit, say, 5 per cent., which I think would be reasonable under the circumstances. I do not think I have any more to say with regard to this measure, but I can only remind honour- able members that the Bill is in charge of the youngest member of the House, and I hope to see that courtesy afforded to him which is always afforded to young members ; and I think I might promise on his behalf that when he gets the Bill into Committee he will be quite willing to afford the House all reasonable ex- planation and to accept all reasonable amend- ments. Mr. T. MACKENZIE (Waihemo) .- I wish to make a personal explanation. The honourable gentleman stated that I blamed the Chairman of the Local Bills Committee for not having had these plans there for the three months. I alluded to a statement made by the Premier with regard to the three months, and I quoted from the rules of this House; and when the honourable member stated that they were before the Local Bills Committee I was cor- recting the member for Nelson City in regard to the statement he contradicted about the three months relating to the Premier's asser- tion. I am also going to show that the honour- able member, wherever he gets his figures from, has made a most dreadful mistake. He wished to know where I obtained my figures from with regard to the Patea Harbour- Mr. R. MCKENZIE .- I rise to a point of order. Is this a personal explanation, Sir ? Mr. SPEAKER .- 1 am waiting to see how the honourable member connects these remarks with the explanation he desires to make. The honourable gentleman. I presume, considers he has been misrepresented. Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- My personal explana- tion is that the honourable member said that I had misrepresented the export values of pro- duce from Patea. That was his statement, and he wished to know my authority. My authority is the annual report of the Patea Harbour Board, which has just been placed upon the table. This is what it says :- 
<page:81>
1893 TO 1900 INCLUSIVE. 33.186 1857 . . . . . . .. 1800 99,592 . . . . . 115,254 194 .. .. 108,792 1-95 . . . . 113,784 1596 . . . . .. 113,707 1-97 . . .. 100,383 1848 103,208 1809 . . 83,927 They are the figures I quoted, and the honour- able member has surely made a terrible mistake in saving that I was incorrect- An Hon. MEMBER .- They are the figures I quoted. Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- Then, if they are the figures you quoted, why do you say that I am wrong ? Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) .- Before the mover replies, I would like to say a few words. It seems to me that there is a misunderstanding, which was probably started by the Premier, with regard to plans. Whether the Premier was correct or not. others have been confused by him, and this is generally the case after the Premier speaks. The House is probably aware that there are two plans which are necessary, and the plans which have been referred to are not the plans which are supposed to be produced before the Local Bills Committee, but the plans which are required by the Marine Department to show whether the works which are proposed to be constructed in the Bill are works that the colony can approve of, or whether they are works which might be detrimental to the general interests of the colony. Why, I believe that one reason why these plans have not been deposited three months before was because the Works proposed may not be new works, but     the extension of old works. It is said by the Chairman of the Local Bills Committee that there was no necessity to deposit them. Well. Sir, his argument is that this Bill which is now before us is not a Bill giving them authority to construct new works. Well, I am not sure of that, and I should like to hear what the Minister for Public Works has to say upon that matter. It is true that in this Bill there is not direct authority given for any fresh works, but under the Bill of which this is practically an amendment there is an authority to construct works. I refer to the Act of 1883. Under that Act, if they get the money they pro- pose under this Bill, I take it they can go on completing works which they have already partially constructed. No doubt the honour- able member in his reply will state whether the works proposed are works in continuation of those works started under the Act of 1883, or whether they are entirely new works. therefore requiring the deposit of plans with the Marine Department, or Order in Council. If these are in continuation of works begun under the Act of 1883, then I should like to ask the Chairman of the Local Bills Committee whether the : not, and it is a little difficult to understand Standing Orders have been complied with, be- ! whether they are going backwards or forwards. VOL. CXVII .- 5. to have been deposited in the Stipendiary Magistrate's Court three weeks before the Bill came before the Local Bills Committee. How- ever, that is a point which the honourable member in charge of the Bill can make clear when he replies. Then, with regard to the Bill itself. I have looked over the Harbour Board accounts, and I find they have, according to the secretary or treasurer's report, from $800 to €900 of surplus revenue. They make the claim, no doubt quite correctly, that they are able to pay interest upon their loan ; but the point is this: that the loan proposed to be raised under this Bill is a loan of $10,000. They have $800 or €900 of surplus revenue --- not €1,000, as the honourable member for Franklin says-and they can pay 8 per cent. upon this $10,000. I should like the honourable member to make clear in his reply why they have asked for $10,000 only. In the report of the Harbour Board Mr. McKenna suggests a loan of $18,000 to $20,000. It will be found in the report of the Patea Harbour Board, laid on the table this session. Under the heading of "Loans," he says,- "This brings me to the question of the re- -newal of the loan of €13,000, falling due in August, 1902, and the obtaining of further money for Heads improvements. It seems to me that the surplus ordinary revenue is sufficient to provide some $800 or $900 per annum for further borrowing, and if we can arrange for a long term of $18,000 to $20,000 we shall be within our means if we can obtain the money (including sinking fund) at 54 per cent." Then he goes on to show the importance of the harbour, and the increase of revenue that will ensue, which very likely is true. But what I want the honourable gentleman in charge of the Bill to state to the House, is whether the plans of which he spoke some time ago, and which ought to have been deposited in the Marine Department three months before new works are started -- whether those plans have been gone into. Has Mr. Leslie Reynolds, the engineer, been at Patea ; has he surveyed the harbour, has he laid out the plans, and has he estimated the value of work it is proposed to do? If so, is his estimate €10,000, or under that, or is it $18,000 or $20,000, as the secre- tary of the Harbour Board says? Well, if the secretary of the Harbour Board is right, then the Bill does not provide sufficient funds for the carrying-out of this work, as evidently it is intended to do. If that is the case, I think the honourable member will have to seek the advice of those for whom he is acting, and to assure the House that if a further sum is required he will put that sum into the Bill at a later stage. With regard to the question raised by the honourable member for Waihemo, and the honourable member for Franklin, I have looked through the accounts of the Patea Harbour Board to see whether they are making progress or whether they are 
<page:82>
honourable member for Waihemo is correct when he says that in 1899 to 1900 the exports dropped considerably. When one tries to find out the reason for the drop it is rather curious. Mr. McKenna himself recognises the drop and at tempts to explain it. He says the reason of the drop is owing, no doubt, to the temporary stopping of the meat works by the high price of stock. If the Harbour Board is dependent upon meat-works, which may be stopped when the price of stock is high, for the value of its exports, it seems to me that the revenue is not founded on a very solid basis. Very strong argument would have to be adduced to warrant this Harbour Board in spending extra money on harbour-works, which may only increase their difficulties, and not increase their revenue. And it is obvious that the expenditure of money on the harbour will not decrease the price of stock : and if the revenue is to be dependent upon the price of stock, then I take it that the expenditure about to take place will not have that effect, but will increase the charges without increasing the revenue. Looking through the general items of export that. take place from this harbour one finds that what is true of stock and meat is true of a great many other exports. I find that wool, instead of having increased in quantity and value, decreased last year, and that the amount of wool exported now is not within 1,300 bales of what it was in 1894. In 1893 they had 6,043 bales exported. and in 1900 there were only 4.799 bales exported. That is a very serious falling-off. One pauses to in-   quire as to what is the reason for this falling-off in the quantity of wool sent away from this harbour. Either it is that the harbour will not allow the ships that would go there to come in, in which case the expenditure is justifiable, or else it is that the wool and other products are b -ing sont by rail to Wanganni or Wellington, where an easier port may be found. I find that one of the few things that have increased in quantity is the bales or bags of fungus that have been sent away from this port. They have risen from 101 bags in 1994 to 602 bags. The export of tallow has decreased. So we find that many of the items instead of increasing have decreased. The only thing which has kept up the revenue of this Board have been the new industries. For instance. they have lately begun to export cheese, which was now to them until the year 189. There is a remarkable rise in the export of cheese from 1899 to 1900 of from 470 cases to 1.798 cases : and if it be true that that rise is to con- tinne, then I certainly should agree with the honourable member in charge of the Bill that further expenditure of money is justitied in this harbour. But, leaving the exports, one does find with respect to imports a considerable increase. The secretary draws attention to that in these words : - " The inward cargo shows the largest result in the annals of the Board by about 1,200 tons Mr. J. Allen really is somewhat hard to know whether this extra expenditure is justified or not. I have no doubt the honourable member in charge of the Bill, who comes from the district and knows its capabilities and wants, will be able to lay before the House a sufficient reason for us to vote for the second reading of the Bill. When we get into Committee there will be two questions which the honourable member will have to consider. One has already been mentioned- namely, as to limiting the rate of interest to be paid on the loan. Such a provision has been inserted in other Bills of late, and I have no doubt that some such provision will be in- serted in this Bill. But there is another clause which honourable members have not mentioned, and one which, I think, has been inserted in nearly every local Bill which has come before the House of late years. I refer to a clause dealing with the sink- ing fund. The Patea Harbour Board has recognised all through its existence the neces- sity for providing for payment of its loans when they become dne, and one finds in the accounts of the Board that it has in the past made provision for the payment of a sinking fund. The sinking fund accounts are shown, and in the course of a few years there will be sufficient out of the sinking funds to redeem the loans that are already in existence. An Hon. MEMBER. -- How much do they set apart for sinking fund ? Mr. J. ALLEN. 24 per cent. in some cases. That is, of course, a very heavy amount to set apart. I see the sinking fund account on a £10,000 loan is 24 per cent., and a sinking fund of 24 per cent. is also provided for on a loan of $3,000. An Hon. MEMBER .- What is the currency ? Mr. J. ALLEN .- I do not know the currency of the loans. But, with regard to the ban pro- posed to be raised under this Bill, I find no provision for a sinking fund. The honourable member will perhaps be able to tell us why the Board in this instance has departed from what seems to me to be a wise practice, and a prac- tice they have followed in regard to all previous loans - why in this instance they are not abiding by what seems a good plan. There may be good reasons for departing from what they have been doing in the past. Mr. HASELDEN .- It is provided for in the accounts. Mr. J. ALLEN. - The honourable gentleman assures me that a sinking fund is provided for, not in the Bill but in the accounts. The honour- able gentleman will, no doubt, as he agrees with the principle of a sinking fund, be prepared to place this clause also in the Bill in Committee. Therefore when the Bill gets into Committee there are two new clauses to be inserted. one limiting the amount to be paid by way of in- terest, and the other providing for a sinking fund. I think the honourable gentleman will admit it will be wise to put in a sinking fund, 
<page:83>
I have been reading only lately of an effect in London of the floating of our loans there with- out making provision for sinking fund. and there can be no doubt if we had provided in our colonial loans for a sinking fund, as we had in the old days, we should have been able to float them at par, or a premium, instead of a dis- count of 4 or 5 per cent. If that be the case, that is a strong argument for this Board pro- viding for a sinking fund ; for it cannot afford to dat a loan at a discount, it wants all the money it can get. Another reason is that it is right with works of this nature-harbour-works, that are not permanent works in the sense that railways are permanent - to provide for repay- ment. A railway is a work which of necessity must be kept in repair. The rails are renewed and replaced by heavier ones from year to year, and the rolling-stock is replaced, so that really after fifty years it is probably superior in regard to actual value to when it started; this being done out of revenue, and not out of fresh capital. This Harbour Board is not similar to that. Harbour-works cannot be kept for ten or twenty years in as good repair as when they were started. The sea Ihaves in a way it is not expected to behave; good wharf accommodation becomes inferior owing to the action of the elements; and it is reckoned that provision should be made for repaving a loan within a reasonable period. I hope that the honourable gentleman will con- sent to these two clauses in Committee, so that, he might have no difficulty in passing his Bill through. In Committee I will do my best to  assist him to pass it, and I hope honourable in moers will give him that assistance which they usually give to a new member having charge of a Bill for the first time. Mr. WITHEFORD (Auckland City). - 1 in- tend to support this Bill. The Bill has now been discussed from every point of view, and I hope there will be no further delay. Patea is a fme district, and they are fine people down there. deserving every encouragement. There- fare I trust that the measure will be passed, and let us proceed with other business. Mr. HASELDEN (Patea) .--- This Bill has raised more discussion than I ever thought it would, and it only shows how important the Patea Harbour is. I can assure honourable members that it is the most important har- bour on the West Coast, judging by the large amount of produce exported from and im ported to it. At present it acts as a great feeder for Wellington. An enormous amount of stuff is imported to and exported from it. A great many figures have been read to- night. but I will give honourable members a fes simple ones. In 188- the imports amounted In 1900 they were 9,081 to 2, 727 tons. tons. which shows a very considerable in- In 1888 the exports of wool from the crease. Patea Harbour amounted to 2,156 bales, and in 1900 they were 4,799 bales, showing a very large increase in that item alone. That there foot-and-mouth disease in the Argentine Re- public, and therefore more sheep have been frozen at the central freezing.works. It is to be hoped that the foot-and-mouth disease will not scourge the Argentine again, though it would be a ver: good thing for New Zealand if it did. We have an enormous increase in exports of butter, cheese, and bacon from Patea. I think every member in this House knows that Patea is one of the richest districts in New Zealand, and that it is increasing every vear in the amount of produce exported from it. As we used to say, the butter industry is progressing " by leaps and bounds," and very many of our other industries are being assisted and are increasing. Moreover, the settlers are receiving a very large amount of money for the produce of their labour, and this will result in a still further increase in the amount of our exports. Steamers are being built specially for this trade, and I do not think that there is a sounder Harbour Beard in the colony than that of Patea. It has always paid its interest and provided 24 per cent. for a sinking fund. We have now avail- able an annual revenue of no less than $1,910, and it is increasing every year, showing that after providing for interest there is an ap parent surplus of $535. There has been spent out of revenue $5,000, showing that over $1,060 a year of revenue has been spent in improving the harbour-works. It is now proposed to obtain $10,000 to further improve the harbour by carrying the wall further out to sea, so as to prevent the accumulation of silt caused by the north-west currents. Much larger vessels . ill then be able to enter the harbour than at pre- sent. Of the 98,000 expended, $5.200) was spent in Guide Pier: 12,200 in wharves and sheds ; payment of staff. $100; and dumping plant, 2430, bringing the total to $7.980; 9.0. and I can say that it was well spent; I can assure the honourable member the finances are sound. An Hon. MI MBER .-- But where are you going to get the revenue ? Mr. HASELDEN .--- The revenue is coming from the increased imports and exports, which are increasing year by year. If wool is de- creasing, the export will more than be made up by butter, cheese, and bacon. I think I shall show the honourable member for Avon that the endowment has not been disposed of. There is no less a sum than 9381 95. 2d. paid yearly in rents for these endowments, proving at once that they have not been disposed of. The rate of interest is a matter for Committee ; but at present money is borrowed at 4} per cent., and I see no reason why we should not, with so much cheap money in the market, ob- tain it at the same rate. I was rather amused at one honourable member speaking about the competition with the railway, and saying that we should not improve the harbour because it would compete with the Government railway. I think everybody knows that that land carriage

Bill read a second time. ## DUNEDIN CITY AND SUBURBAN TRAMWAYS BILL. Mr. MILLAR (Dunedin City) .- In rising to move the second reading of this Bill it will be unnecessary for me to detain the House at any great length because it is practically a machinery Bill. Under the Act which was passed last ses- sion honourable members will remember that authority was given to the City Council to pur- chase the tramways of Dunedin, and likewise to borrow the sum of $200,000 for that purpose. After making full inquiries they have decided to adopt electricity as the motive-power for the trams. In order to enable them to do that they had to get the necessary water-rights. These water-rights have been obtained from the War- den's Court, and one of the conditions for con- structing the race and dam was that the Council should be liable for any damage that might ac- crue by reason of that work, and it was neces- sary, therefore, for them to come to Parliament to get that power. If honourable members will look at the Bill they will see that the first three clauses are machinery clauses. A great deal of misapprehension exists in the minds of certain members that certain things are in this Bill which are not there at all. There is nothing in the Bill which states that the tramways shall pass through a certain part of the Town Belt.  An Hon. MEMBER. - Can you say that they may not go there ? Mr. MILLAR .- At any rate, this is a mere Committee objection, and the honourable mem- bers who are talking about this matter know that it is a Committee objection, and that in Committee we can deal with the whole subject. No. 4 clause simply clears up a defect in the definition of suburban districts in the original Act. An Hon. MEMBER .- Where is that ? Mr. MILLAR .- You will find it in the Tram- ways Act. Then, clause 5 clearly defines the position of the City of Dunedin as the pro- moter of the tramways. Clause 6 vests the mining privileges in the Corporation. Then. clause 7 is a clause which throws the liability upon the Council for any damage which may accrue in connection with the construction of the dam or weir. That is one of the conditions imposed by the Warden's Court when granting this right. Clause 8 simply makes a good title for the City Corporation in respect of these works, and that is absolutely necessary, because a large sum of money will be bor- rowed for the construction of these tramways. $50,000 has already been borrowed, and they may have to go to the foreign money- market for more. This is to make a good title for those who may advance the money. Sec- tions 10 and 11 simply contain what is con- Mr. Haselden and dam are deemed to be waterworks, with this exception : that if it passes through a mining district a miner is not liable if he fouls the water that passes along the water-race. Clause 14 gives the ordinary power to make by-laws. Clause 15 refers to the form of debentures to be issued. Clause 16 gives authority for the issue and sale of debentures. Clause 17 pro- vides that the consent of the ratepayers is un- necessary before applying for an authorising order. The reason for that is this: A poll has already been taken on a loan of $50,000, which it is understood will cover the whole matter. and the ratepavers have sanctioned it. There- fore the Council ask that they be not required to take another poll of the ratepayers if there should be any slight deviation of the line. It has been proposed to extend the line beyond the limits of the boroughs as contained in the original Act. Here is a case in point : Honour- able members will know where Anderson's Bay is. The proposal is to carry a line to that locality : but that cannot be done under the original Act, because Anderson's Bay is not contiguous to the city, although it is con- tiguous to one of the boroughs. This clause. therefore, gives power to carry the line beyond the ordinary boundaries. Clause 18 of the Bill sets out that the tramways are not liable to be rated by the local authority. That is only fair, as an agreement has been entered into between the local boroughs for rent to be paid for the trams running through their districts. The rent that is agreed on will be a fair rent. no doubt, and there should be no other rate beyond it. Clause 19 embodies in this Bill what is contained in section 10 of the Second Schedule of " The Tramways Act, 1894." Clause 20 states that the period for which any borough may delegate its authority shall be stated in the Order in Council. At present there seems to be no time defined. Then follow the schedules to the Bill, granting the right to the Council to 350 heads on the Taieri River and to thirty on the Lee Stream. The form of the debentures is also set out. I hope. Sir, the Bill will be allowed to go through with- out further delay. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Mines) .- Sir. I should like to know if the honourable mem! er is prepared to refer the Bill to the Goldfields and Mines Committee. There are mining interests affected, and under the law all Bills affecting mining and mining interests are to be referred to that Committee. I have not had time to look closely into the measure, and I am not prepared to say what position I would take up in regard to it. If the honourable gentle- man would let the Bill go to the Committee I think it would facilitate its passage. There are some clauses to which opposition might be raised, but I do not intend to refer to them at present. I think the honourable gentleman should allow the Bill to go to the Goldfields and Mines Committee. Mr. MILLAR .- I might reply at once to the. 
<page:85>
mining privilege granted now, and all that I draw the attention of the House, before I go is asked in the Bill is the right to transmit i proviso I got inserted into the Bill of last the power to the city. I think there is no berssity to refer the Bill to the Goldfields and Mines Committee, as it does not affect the gold- hell- or the Mining Art. Mr. MORRISON (Caversham) .- Sir, I regret that 't has fallen to my lot to have to make vie remarks of an antagonistic nature against the measure now before us. I would have pre- ferred that some other gentleman had to take in the attitude I am required to take up to- tiet, seeing that I am a strong believer in the macipali-ation of our tramways in Dun- rain. and supported the honourable gentleman strongly last year in connection with the Bill he then introduced on behalf of the City of Das din. To give honourable members an opportunity of knowing the exact position I occupy, I will claim the indulgence of this House to read a portion of the remarks I made last war when supporting the honourable gentle- m.m. I make this extract from Hansard :- " While he was pleased that the City Cor- poration of Dunedin were purchasing the rights hed by the original promoters, he wanted to maintain the same privileges under this new mercure as the borough which he represented had under the present agreement. He had chatted the matter over with the honourable member for Dunedin City (Mr. Millar), who Wa- perfectly agreeable to put in any clauses winien might preserve the rights of those boroughs. He had a new clause drafted, which he would take the opportunity of moving when the Bill went into Committee. This new clause  was in the direction of reserving the rights of prl- who resided in the adjacent boroughs. He should be very pleased to assist the honour- ali member for Dunedin City (Mr. Millar) in facilitating the passage of this measure through the House, provided always that the rights of the [wotl: he represented were carefully guarded." That is the attitude I took up last year. In the measure which is now before the House let us examine for a moment whether the City Council of Dunedin are prepared to stand in the position of the original promoters of the Danedin City tramways. Are they going to preserve the rights of the suburban boroughs ? I -av No; and I say this Bill is a very carefully drafted Bill, which is going to do the suburban districts in and about Dunedin a great injustice if we pass it as printed. Now let us examine this clause 19, which says, - "Section ten of the Second Schedule to . The Tramways Act, 1594.' shall in all re- Iwrts apply to the local authorities of the arghs in the suburban district as if two- : ind. of the length of the tramway proposed i be laid were in the City of Dunedin." Why. Sir. it is an entire revolution of the whois principle laid down in the Second Schule of " The Tramways Act. 1894," and it is trying to get behind the arrange- vett that was entered into last year, not only with the Caversham Borough, but other brorghs in and about Dunedin that are on to describe this Second Schedule, to a wear to retain the privileges that the suburban boroughs held from the original promoters. It is the last subelause of clause 11 of " The Dunedin City and Suburban Tramways Act, 1900 ": " Provided also that, except to the extent to which the rights and powers of the boroughs of the suburban districts are by this Act expressly modified, the same shall remain unaffected." The whole position of that was. this : that any existing agreement or any exist- ing arrangement prior to the passing of this Act as between the original owners of the Dunedin City tramways and any suburban district was to remain intact. Now the City of Dunedin comes down with this amending Bill, and the honour- able gentleman who introduced it described it as a machinery Act ; but it is going to upset all agreements which have been entered into with any of the suburban districts, and it is going to make the City of Dunedin sole arbiter as to where they are to run their tramways, and as to what they are to do. But let me fall back on clause 10 of the Second Schedule of the 1894 Act. or what is known as the Government statute dealing with the tramways. The Bill now before the House says section 19 of the Second Schedule of " The Tramways Act, 1994." shall in all respects apply to the local authori- ties, and so forth. Now, what does this Second Schedule of the 1894 statute say? No. 1 sub- elause of clause 10 says :- "Subject to these regulations the Governor may, on a joint application, or on two or more separate applications, settle and make an order empowering two or more local authorities re- spectively jointly to construct the whole or separately to construct parts. and jointly or separately to own the whole or parts thereof ; and all the provisions of these regulations which relate to the construction of tramways shall ex- tend and apply to the construction of the whole and the separate parts of such tramways as last aforesaid ; and the form of the authorising order may be adapted to the circumstances of the case." The honourable gentleman kindly glossed over that ; he knew he was on thin ice and he did not want to enlighten the House too much. But let us examine subclause (2) of the same sec- tion 10 of the Second Schedule. It says,- " When it is proposed to lay down a tramway in two or more districts, or to extend into another district any existing tramway, and any local authority having jurisdiction in any of such districts does not consent thereto, or will not apply or join in applying for an authorising order, the Governor, on the application of the local authority proposing that the work shall be done, may nevertheless make such order if he is satisfied, after inquiry, that two-thirds of the length of such tramway is proposed to be laid in the district of the local authority so proposing as aforesaid, and the form of the authorising order may be adapted to the circumstances of the case." 
<page:86>
is called an " authorising order," and they have to make a joint or two or more separate appli- cations. Shortly put, the whole meaning of the proposal of the City of Dunedin as con- tained in this Bill is this : they are asking for powers from this House which would enable them to go into the Caversham district or any other suburban district, and if they are success- ful in procuring that power, then they can snap their fingers at any agreement which may have been entered into with any local Borough Coun- cil in the past, and they can lay down tram- ways, rails, or lift or alter or erect posts along any street or road, or anything they like-in fact, they can do anything without consulting the Borough Council. The City of Dunedin virtually seek the power of entering into any suburban district in or about Dunedin and doing just as they like. All they would have to do would be to apply to the Governor for an authorising order, and the suburban districts interested would not have a voice at all in the question. I ask, Is this in conformity with the statute we passed last session ? I say it is not. and that the City of Dunedin at the present moment is trying to get behind the provisions of the statute of 1990. There are other objec- tionable features in this Bill, some equally as strong and as cogent as the one I have just mentioned. In clause 17 it is stated that the consent of the ratepayers is not necessary before applying for an authorising order; and the honourable gentleman used as an illustration that it might affect my district -- the section from the City of Dunedin to Anderson's Bay.  But a proviso has been added to that clause by the Local Bills Committee, to the effect that the clause should only apply to the construction of tramways sanctioned by the ratepayers prior to the passing of this Act. The origmal Bill as drafted by the solicitors in Dunedin and sent up here sought to give them full control and power to construct tramways where they liked in or about Dunedin without consulting the ratepavers ; but the clause has been amended, although when it comes to be examined, it does not go far enough vet in my opinion. Clause 18 states that " The tramways shall not, nor shall any property or appliances belonging to the city in any way connected therewith, or with the generation or transmission of power to be used in connection therewith, be liat le to be rated by any local authority." I would like to know what the City of Dunedin means by this clause. Here is a Bill brought down and placed before this House which states that the ratepavers are not to be consulted with regard to the lifting or the laving-down of any fresh lines of tramways, which states that the rate- payers are not to be consulted with regard to whether it is advisable to extend the tramway system in any portion of Otago, and in the next breath they want power to say, " If we acquire land, erect buildings, or establish any other works in your district, you will get no rates from us." They want to be exempt from paying any rates in the suburban dis- Mr. Morrison have the power to lay down tramways all over your district whether you like it or not, and we are going to take all the money we can out of your district : but if you want any rates from us you cannot get them under this Bill." That is the position ; and I ask honourable members if they are going to support so obnoxious a mea- sure, the provisions of which I have only just touched upon. In fact, owing to the difficulty I am labouring under in speaking to-night, I have been obliged to skim over many of the points more hurriedly than I otherwise should have done ; but, Sir, I think I have said enough to show the House the gravity of the situation. The whale meaning of this Bill is " Trust the City Council of Dunedin." Well, I, for one, do not trust them too much. We know what the City Council of Dunedin have done in the past. Why, only a short time ago there was an at- tempt on the part of that City Council to get the necessary authority to run the tramway service through the Botanical Gardens. The honour- able gentleman did not tell us that. In fact, I believe a committee of the City Council re- ported in favour of such a scheme, and a considerable amount of agitation was created locally over the matter, and it was only at the last meeting of the Council that, by seven to six, it was decided that the proposal should not be entered into. And I say, when you find a City Council composed of men who are pre- pared to cut into our public reserves simply to enable the tramways to yield a little more revenue to the city, it behoves members from all parts of the colony to see that the reserves that have been set aside for the benefit of the publie and for the enjoyment of future genera- tions are kept inviolate for the people. I shall not take up the time of the House any further, but I hope honourable members will think over the various points I have touched upon. ] shall not block the honourable gentleman in his second reading. I shall give him his second reading ; but I shall certainly see that there are some very drastic alterations made in Com- mittee, or else I can promise the honourable gentleman about the liveliest time he ever had in this House. Mr. CARNCROSS (Taieri) .- Sir, as this is a Bill which has a very close bearing upon the district I represent I do not intend to give a silent vote upon it. I intend to vote against the second reading, as, in my opinion, the Bill should not be allowed to pass in its present form. I am not going into a general considera- tion of the Bill, but will regard it merdy from a local point of view so far as it concerns my d.strict But, although it may be only a local point of view, it is a highly important one, and I should not be doing my duty to my con- stituents if I did not speak upon this measure to-night. The honourable gentleman, in his reply, may possibly tell us that the local lodies in my district have offered no opposition to this Bill as it is framed. Well, I be- 9.30. lieve that may be correct : but I am not here to be governed by the local bodies 
<page:87>
duty to make them known here, and record them, as I do not intend to let them do my thinking for me. I am rather inclined to lament that the local bodies in my district have been so apathetic in this matter, and have not recognised the disastrous bearing this Bill may possibly have on their own interests. The honourable gentleman, in his opening remarks, referred to clause 7, which declares that the Council shall be responsible for any damage which may ensue in connection with this dam which may be built. The clause reads thus :- " In respect of the said license No. 1 (dam), the said Corporation shall, as from the date when it comes to construct the dam or weir which it is empowered to construct, be deemed to be liable to all persons and bodies, corporate and politic, including His Majesty the King, for any damage caused through the con- struction, breaking-away, or other failure of the proposed works." You see, Sir, by inference it is recognised that there is a possibility, if not a probability, of some day an accident occurring, and this dam burst- ing. Now, Sir, what would be the result that would follow if there were an accident in the shape of this dam bursting ? The consequences would be frightful to consider if there should be anything faulty in the construction of that dam, and there should be a break-away. It is proposed to build a dam that will be 30 ft. high. It will have the effect of damming up the river for three miles, with an average width of five chams. Those are not my own estimates ; they are taken from one of the schedules of the Bill  itself. The First schedule says,- " Length of dam wall : 160 ft. " Greatest height of same : 30 ft. above ordi-   nary river-level. " Breadth of same at base: 30 ft. " Length and width of water area : Length, three miles ; average width, 5 chains." Just imagine, Sir, what would be the result if a dam of that magnitude, placed as it is in a narrow gorge, were to break away. The water would come down in a wall 30 ft. high, and as it emerged from the gorge it would spread over the Taieri Plain and do incalculable damage. It is not within the means of the City of Dunedin to repay the damage that would be done, and the city would be made bankrupt. They could not pay for the damage that would be done if a di-aster took place. Sir, it is well known that the Taieri contains the most highly cultivated farms in Otago. Every farm there is highly cultivated, and there is enormous value in the improvements. The farmers of the West Taieri have for years past spent thousands and thou- sands of pounds in building a wall or embank- ment as a protection for their farms against river floods. In the event of the dam bursting the protective embankment, upon which they have at great sacrifice spent so much money, would be scattered like chaff. and the water would spread over the whole of the West Taieri district. carrying ruin and desolation over thou- sands of acres, and ruining farmers who have reparation for such loss. I referred just now to the fact that it would be impossible for the City of Dunedin to pay for the dam- age that would be done in the destruction of property. But what about the destruction of life? Can you' put a clause into this Bill that will give compensation for the lives that must inevitably be destroyed if there is a break- away there ? When it comes to loss of human life nothing man can do will make reparation for that. I need not do more than remind honourable members of the disaster at James- town. They will remember the great destruc- tion of life and property on that occasion. It is only the other day that we read of the re- sults of a bursting dam in Virginia, in connec- tion with which many lives were lost. I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that the dams at that place were imagined to be per- fectly safe, and the engineers no doubt gave their guarantee as to its safety. We shall be told the same thing in the case of this dam. We shall doubtless be assured that the dam will be most substantially built ; but there can be no certainty about it. I say it would be a very wrong thing to allow a dam to be erected at the proposed site, and I shall do whatever I can to prevent it. Even though we so amend the Bill in Committee that we deprive the Dunedin City Council of getting its water-supply from the Taieri River no injustice will be done, for we are not taking away from them all opportunity of getting a water-power supply. They can get water from the Waipori River, a few miles further on, without building any dam. I am aware that there will be a greater initial cost, but only about $10,000 more ; and, according to the re- port of their own engineer, the annual cost will be considerably less. Their own engineer's figures show that it will save $9 2s. per horse- power if they obtain their supply from the Wai- pori River, as compared with taking it from the Taieri River. In the face of the undoubted fact that they have another source from which they may obtain their supply, and without running the same risk of damage to life and property, I feel more than justified in opposing the Bill. I think it would be a wrong thing to allow this Bill to go through in its present shape. When the Bill reaches the Committee stage I shall do my best to make certain amend- ments in it. So far as my district is concerned, I ask honourable members to place themselves in the same position as I am in. They may have rivers close to a centre of population, and the city may wish to dam up a river in order to get electric power from it. Let them con- sider how they would like the same thing to take place in their district. I intend to record my vote against the Bill. Mr. GILFEDDER (Wallace). - I have no intention of opposing this Bill, nor do I intend to retard its progress by way of stonewalling. I must say I compliment the member for Caversham on being in such good form, and on making the speech he has delivered to-night. 
<page:88>
some of us thought he would not be able to take his place in the House this session, or, if he did so that he would not be able to acquit him- self so creditably as he has done to-night ; and we hope that he will continue to improve in health, and that before very long he will be back in his good old form-in the form in which he has been in the days that are gone by. From the tenor of the remarks made on the second reading of this Bill it must appear to the most casual observer that there is more in this measure than appears on the surface, or was stated by the honourable member who introduced the Bill. It has been said on previous occasions during the day that there is an inclination on the part of the House to pass these local Bills without properly regarding their present or future effect. Members representing districts outside Dunedin have said there is a serious danger that this measure will prejudicially affect the interests of the suburban townships. It is to be hoped that honourable members will see that such a clause is put in the Bill in Committee as to preclude any attempt that should be made by the Cor- poration of Dunedin to interfere with their rights and privileges, or do anything against the interests of the suburban townships around Dunedin. Another point was dealt with by the honourable member for Caversham, and that is the danger in the near future that the City Council will construct the Castle Street tram- way through the Gardens. Knowing the Gar- dens in Dunedin intimately, and admiring the good taste of the Dunedin people in doing what they have done to beautify those Gar-  dens, I consider it would be nothing short of an act of vandalism to run a tramway through what might be regarded as one of the prettiest spots in Dunedin. As one travels through the colony and sees the attempts made in different towns to improve botanical gardens that will be a credit to the place, and the successful efforts in New Plymouth in this direction, one cannot but feel that, should in the course of time the Corporation feel it advisable to run the tramway through the Gardens, then one would be constrained to vote against any measure that could be introduced in order to give them liberty to do so. I hope the honourable member in charge of the Bill will not consider I am opposed to the measure otherwise than on principle, and if he will give the House an assurance that he will assent to a clause being inserted in Committee to pre- clude Corporations from making any attempt in this direction I shall support the Bill, and vote for its third reading. Another point raised by the honourable member for Caversham was in regard to clause 17, where it is not in- tonded to take a vote of the people interested. This is another point that has been raised to-day : that the House is too careless or too liberal in passing local Bills-measures that affect only one locality, and not the colony as a whole. Where is the junior member for Dunedin City - the professor of constitu- Mr. Gilfedder ratepavers - are to be overlooked, and tram- lines are to be constructed whether they like it or not. 1 consider it is the place of the junior member for Dunedin City-a leading au- thority on the constitutional aspect of such a question -to be in his place to protest against any attempt on the part of the Corporation to pass such a law. I hope the honourable men- ber in charge of the Bill will go further than the amendment suggested by the Local Bills Committee, and not endeavour to take out of the hands of the people the right they should possess to control the local expenditure in con- nection with the construction of the tramways, and such acts as will materially or prejudicially affect their own interests and those of sub- urban townships. I am sure that when this is pointed out to the junior member for Dunedin City he will not agree with his senior colleague in this respect. I hope the honourable member will make the point clear, so that we may be able to support the Bill. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) .- Sir, I believe my objections to this measure are similar to those of the honourable member for Caversham - namely, Committee ones ; but the objections of the honourable member for Taieri imperil the whole Bill. I support the Bill, but I want an amendment made in Committee, and I feel constrained to meet the argument of the member for Taieri in regard to the question of the dam. His argument is that, because the city to secure power has to construct a dam, the presence of that dam is a danger, and that therefore Dunedin is to have no electric trams at all. Mr. CARNCROSS .- I said you could get it from Waipori. Mr. J. ALLEN .-- I will deal with the Wai- pori argument presently. If this is the way we are to look upon enterprises of this kind, then we shall have no enterprises at all, for they are all more or less dangerous. We must not con- struct a railway, because, forsooth, the train  might run over a precipice and kill the people in it. We must not construct our waterworks, because the dam might break away, and those living in the valley below be drowned. Our waterworks in Dunedin are in exactly the same position as this proposed dam. At any time it might break away and damage be done; but you would not say that therefore the water- works should not be constructed, and that the people should be supplied with artesian water or water from tanks. That is not the modern way of looking at a matter like that. It is impossible to adopt the means requisite for carrying out works of this kind without in- curring some risks. The risks are minimised by our having the experience of ages. In deai- ing with works of this nature the engineers have the experience of those who have gone bit- fore them as their guide, and. having that experi- ence, they will make the works of such a nature that there will be very little risk of danger in the future. I have no doubt that if this dem is constructed there will be very little risk, either 
<page:89>
Dunedin will be responsible for the damage d .ne. Mr. CARNCROSS. - You cannot make good less of life. Mr. J. ALLEN .- That is true ; but in every ordinary day avocation we run the risk of losing lit ... The risk is, however, very remote. If the opposition were successful, there would be no power for electric works. Surely that would be I say the carrying the argument too far. Borough of Dunedin can meet all the charges that may be made against it for any damage that may be done by the ercetion of this dam. There is the power to strike a rate, and I do not think it will be said for a moment that a city of fifty thousand people would not be able to ineet any damage that might happen owing to the breaking of this dam. Anyway, I submit that the argument is sufficiently strong in favour of the construction of such a dam, even though some amount of damage may possibly take place. But the honourable member has said that another means of supply is open to the Dunedin Corporation - the Wai- pori scheme. Well, it is true a supply might i taken from there. It is not so good a sup- piy as the one from the Taieri River. Reports have been made upon both these supplies, and the recommendations are strongly in favour of the supply from the Taieri. I believe it will be necessary vet, though the Corporation does not we it, but will soon see it, to take both the Taieri and the Waipori supplies. They will re- quire both, not only for the city trams -trams  that, no doubt, in the course of a few years will porineate all the suburban districts -- but for electric light and other purposes ; so that both these supplies will in the course of a very short time be necessary. Now, I hope the Taieri and the districts the honourable member spoke for will not be influenced to oppose this scheme from any selfish motive whatever. There is no > 'fish motive on the part of the Borough of Dunedin in starting these works. On the con- trary, they are willing to supply the wants not only of the city, but of the suburbs as well; and I hope the day may come when they may go outside the present suburbs of Dunedin, and if they do, then. no doubt, noth places, the Taieri and the Waipori, will is required. Now, with regard to the other objections raised --- I think they are Committee ones-by the honourable member for Caver- cham. I admit there is a good deal of force in the atomnent be used against clause IT. Clause 17, i. f .re the proviso was put in, provided that no vir of the ratepayers of Dunedin was required ir an extension of these tramways. That. I ogiove, was what the clause at first meant with- mint the proviso ; but, the proviso being put in Units the section to the tramways as now machased that is to say, to the purchase of the Gunlaws. to relaying the lines, and making retrie tramwave of the existing trams. Under en, clause, with the proviso, that can be done without a vote of the ratepaver- ; but, if they am not at all sure whether it is wise to limit the City Corporation with regard to the vote to the extent the proviso has done. I think it would have been wise for a compromise to have been come to between the member in charge of the Bill and the member representing Caversham and some other suburban districts, so that a reason- able extension of the existing tramways might take place without a vote of the ratepavers ; but if they wanted any considerable extension- for instance, another tram-line to Mornington or Roslyn, which may be done some dav -- - then possibly the other honourable member for the City ( Mr. Arnold) would have had something to say about a vote of the ratepayers being re- quired ; but, if only a small extension was re- quested, I think a compromise ought to have been effected. The proviso that has been put in by the Local Bills Committee restricts them to too great an extent in my opinion. As to clause Is, I admit the honourable member has a considerable amount of strong argument with him. That is to say, if the Borough of Dun- edin ereets works in a suburban district for the purposes of the trams, that those works might be liable to rates. That is open to argument. It is a Committee objection, and may be fairly argued when the Bill gets there; but there is no reason why the Bill should be blocked because the clause remains as it is at present. Then, with regard to the more serious objec- tions -- that is, as to clause 19. which permits the Borough of Dunedin, practically speaking. to control the tramways through the suburban districts. Well, Sir, I admit that the mem- bers who are representing the suburban dis- triets are right in doing what is proper to conserve the rights of their constituents. At the same time I hope they will not so limit the power that is being conferred on the Borough of Dunedin as to in any way jeopardize the ex- tension of the tramway system. for the exten- sion to the suburbs is not so much in the interest of the city as it is in the interest of the suburbs themselves. And if the suburban districts seck by any selfish motive to put such restrictions upon the Bill as to prevent this extension, I think the harm will fall more upon the suburbs than upon the city itself. The city can do with these trams if they extend only to the boundaries of the borough itself. That may be sufficient for their purposes, but certainly not for the purposes of the Boroughs of Caver- sham and St. Kilda, or places like these. These are Committee objections to the Bill, and I hope the honourable member, before the Bill goes out of Committee, will be prepared to accept a clause which makes it definite and clear. so far as it can be made clear, that for all time that which has been attempted by the Corporation of Dunedin shall not be possible at all. The Corporation of Dunedin unwisely. and. I think, in abase of the privilege which has been conferred upon them, have been making an attempt to destroy some of our most valuable reserves by carrying these tram- ways through the centre of them. They have 
<page:90>
show that it was necessary to take these tram- ways through the Botanical Gardens. There has been a report by the City Engineer, who says it would be unwise to do so. Sir, that is not my only complaint, but I must question the action of the City Corporation of Dunedin not only with regard to this, but with regard to other matters as well. Why is it that this re- port of the City Engineer was kept within the four walls of the Council buildings, and that it was difficult for anybody to get a sight of it ? Why was it not made public? Because it was contrary to the wish of a few members of the Council, who at that time were in a majority. Sir, fortunately for the good-sense of the people of Dunedin the opinions of the many have had an effect on the City Councillors, and they have rescinded by a majority of seven votes to six the resolution which provided that the tram- ways should be taken through the Gardens. Al- though they have rescinded the resolution that the tramways are to go through the Botanical Gardens, I shall not be satisfied until a provision is made in the Bill to prevent such a thing as the destruction of the Gardens being possible in the future. The Corporation has gone about this business in a very unsatisfactory way. They determined on having electric cars for these tramways, and how have they gone about it? They have taken into consultation with them certain experts by the name of Noves Brothers, whom they have asked to prepare plans and specifications for the construction of electric tramways in Dunedin. Now, Noyes Brothers, if you please, are to be among those  who are to be tenderers on their own plans and their own specifications. I should like to know what chance any outside tenderer would have when he comes to have his tender compared with the one from Noyes Brothers. I think it would be better for the City Corporation had they consulted an expert altogether apart from a firm who afterwards would be a tenderer on their own plans and specifications. No satis- factory answer has ever yet been given to the public in regard to Noves Brothers. And, Sir, the whole thing is wrapped in 10.0. mystery, and the new Councillors who have gone into the Council within the last six months are trying to find out all this business about Noves Brothers and this contract. It is a most difficult thing for them to get to the bottom of the mystery, and, though they have been trying for some time. I do not know if they have got to the bottom of it yet. I do not know if the honourable gentleman in charge of the Bill can enlighten us on the matter, but I doubt very much whether he has himself been enlightened as to the position of Noyes Brothers and the contract. That, however. is only on a par with what has been taking place with re- gard to the reserves. The City Council do not seem to have been consulting the rights of the case at all. They have been consulting-I do not know whether it is their own convenience or whether I should not apply some other term to it ; but, at any rate, the whole thing has been Vr. J. Allen before the Bill goes through this House. At any rate, I wish to have it made perfectly clear -- and I shall use every effort to have it made clear -that the heritage that has been handed down to the people of Dunedin shall in the future be kept for the people of Dunedin. There are those in Dunedin who have their own large gardens and who have their own pleasure- grounds, and who can afford to see these grounds taken from the public and destroyed : but the bulk of the people are determined that that which has been given by our forefathers for the people shall be kept in the future for the people ; and if the honourable gentleman desires to see the Bill go through I hope he will consent to the insertion of a clause to make it quite certain that this heritage shall be pre- served for the people. Sir, these Gardens are small, after all. In the old days our forefathers, in their wisdom, had provided that a reserve should be kept all round the city, commonly now called the Town Belt ; and in days gone by attempts have been made to utilise it for other purposes than those for which it was reserved. Every attempt to so utilise it has been met by the citizens with a distinct refusal. I recollect when an attempt. was made to place a fever hospital on the Town Belt, but the citizens would not have it. I recollect when an attempt was made to put a cemetery on the Town Belt, and unfortu- nately the citizens allowed it. When I came into the House first, one of the foremost things I was called upon to oppose, and to oppose strenu- ously, was a proposal for the further extension of the cemetery along the Town Belt, and from that day to this we have heard nothing of such a proposal. I hope we shall never hear any more of it. It was merely for sordid reasons, too, that this attempt was being made : it was an attempt on the part of the Corporation to get for nothing ground that was to be sold for money to people to bury their dead in. Now comes another attempt by the same body-an attempt to take a portion of the Gardens. It is said it will do no harm to cut the Gardens in two. One gentleman said we had no right to consider the nursery-maids, and asked what the nursery-maids had to do with it. Well, the nursery-maid has a lot to do with it, and so have the children who go there to play. Not only have the nursery-maids and the children something to do with it, but those who congre- gate there on a Sunday have also a say in the matter. I should like honourable members to go through our Gardens on a Sunday afternoon when a band is playing there, and when hundreds -ave, thousands - of people are congregated : when the Gardens are nearly full, just in the place where it is now sug- gested the trams should run. You will see thousands of people in that particular place on a Sunday afternoon-young and old, happy on a fine day, happy in the music, and happy in the knowledge that they have some place they can go to away from the bustle and noise of everyday life and so enjoy one day in the seven. But, Sir, this is all to be ruthlessly and care- 
<page:91>
people living in one of the suburbs on the other side of these Gardens support the trams going through the Gardens for the only reason - and I was astonished when I heard it- that they can get into town one or two minutes earlier than by any other way. Well, Sir, what an argument to bring forward: that because they can get into town one or two minutes earlier they are to destroy the heritage of the people. Sir, I understand that the solicitor who drafted this Bill is coming up to-morrow, and I hope the honourable gentleman who is in charge of the Bill, after consultation with him, will prepare this clause, which I say must be inserted in the Bill to protect these Gardens before I can accept the Bill. I believe the honourable gentle- man is in sympathy with what I am suggesting, and if he can get the solicitor, who no doubt represents the Corporation, to agree to the clause, I believe he will himself be only too glad to adopt it. I understand now that the Corpora- tion have rescinded the resolution, which is evidence that there is no absolute necessity for the tramways to go through the Gardens. I have been in other places where there have been trams, and I know of no single instance where a loop line exists at all. except in Vienna. and there there is a circular tram all round the city, and it is for an entirely different pur- pose than this particular tram that is to run up Castle Street. I know of another case where the trams run to the Gardens-and much larger Gardens than are affected by this Bill but they stopped dead at the Gardens, be-  cause the people would not have them in the Gardens. And I think the people of Dunedin, if they were made properly alive to the situa- tion, would not allow these trams to run through these Gardens at all. One gentleman proposed that not only should the trams go through the Gardens, but that a 66 ft. road should be made as well. Sir, what would the condition of the Gardens be then? It is all very well for those who have their own places of recreation, but it is a very different matter for those who have only small back-vards, and who seek such places as these Gardens for their recreation and for their health and enjoyment. Sir, I believe that those who had to fight these battles before, - and I may say I had to fight some of them before,-will succeed. I recol- let the day when those who for sordid motives -- it is always sordid motives which influence these things -- wanted to utilise the whole of the Triangle in Dunedin for building purposes. And I recollect when Sir Robert Stout and myself and others stood upon the public platform to fight that question. We had a strong meeting with us, and the result of the agitation was that that proposal was stopped. I believe the agita- tion which is going on now in Dunedin-and it will also be carried on in this House will be strong enough to stop any attempt to take the tramways through the Gardens in Dunedin. Sir, these reserves are small enough. The city represents forty to fifty thousand inhabitants, and I take it that in forty years' time it will The Town Belt is small enough, and the Gardens are small enough, even at the present. There are few places where the people can go and have their games and recreations; and if there is a cry now, with forty thousand people, for cricket-grounds and football-grounds and you have not got them, and you are going to cut up and destroy what you do possess, what is there for the future ? Sir, I shall oppose as strongly as I can any attempt to have such a thing done. I am not sure whether under existing legislation it will be possible for them to do it. I doubt very much if they have any further rights than the rights which the old Tramway Company had, and I know that the old Tramway Com- pany could have had no right at all to take the tramway through the Gardens. I know that even under our own Public Works Act you cannot take land from a man's garden, and, if you cannot take it from a man's garden, why should you take it from the people's garden under such an Act ? Mr. ATKINSON .-. They did it here in Moles- worth Street. Mr. J. ALLEN .- That is a special Act, and I was referring to general Acts; but what I say is that under the Public Works Act you cannot, even for railway purposes, take an ornamental garden or an orchard. And if that Act provides that you shall not take an ornamental garden even for railway purposes from the individual, surely there must be in our legislation-and I think there is-a provision that not even a Cor- poration itself can take its own Gardens for the purposes of a railway or a tramway ; and cer- tainly if that provision is not in the legislation, I hope the honourable gentleman will consent to place such a clause in this Bill as to allow the people of Dunedin to retain for all time what has been given to them as a heritage. Mr. T. MACKENZIE (Waihemo). -- Per- sonally, I wish to congratulate my honourable friend the member for Caversham for having risen to-night and raised his voice in the in- terests of the people of this country. The honourable gentleman has been silent during the whole of this session, and I venture to say that if it had not been for the great public interests that were threatened to-night he would have continued to remain silent. And, Sir. if his voice is never heard again in this Assembly --. and I hope and trust that it may be fre- quently ; but if it is not, he has left a monu- ment worthy of emulation in his words to the people to-night ; they should never be forgotten by the people of New Zealand. He has pleaded for the preservation of the reserves which the wise founders of this fair colony said should be the heritage of the people. He has opposed the vandal, and the speculator, and the Bond Street merchant, and the "fat man " of Dunedin. He has helped to stop them from spoiling these It is all very well for the lovely grounds. honourable member for Dunedin City to laugh. Mr. MILLAR .- I am not laughing. Mr. T. MACKENZIE. - We know that it is the wealthy speculator of Dunedin who wants 
<page:92>
tation which waited upon the Council; and some of the Councillors, influenced by these men, have changed, and are now supporting this spoliation of the Gardens. I could give the list of the names, and even the Mayor, one of the Bond Street merchants, who a month ago was as determined as any man in Dunedin against this iniquitous destruction, is now advocating the spoliation of these Gardens by the sending of a roaring, rushing, noisy, dusty tramway right through the very centre of the place, and, hel it not been for the strenuous efforts of Mr. Cohen, the editor of the Star, who night and day has not spared himself in any way, I hardly think they would have got the reseinding of the resolution to send the tramway through there ; and even now that may only be a temporary change: and, though in the meantime it has been carried, and the proposal to take the line through the Gardens has been rejected. I say we want to place the question beyond the possibility of doubt -beyond the power of the Corporation of the city to alter. I know that the honourable member for Dunedin City (Mr. Millar) labours for the people, and that he will do what is fair and just for them. The honour- able gentleman has been entrusted with the Bill, and is loyal to it, and is endeavouring to secure its second reading, and I also agree that there are good features in the Bill that we can approve of : but there are also others that we as strongly disapprove of, and, unless the pro- moters of the Bill agree to the insertion of a clause protecting for all time our Garden from destruction, we shall oppose this Bill at every stage, and effectually block it; and I believe that the people of the colony, and those of Dunedin, will declare, if appealed to, that these reserves shall not be alienated from them, or tampered with ; and not only from Dunedin, because these reserves are not alone the pro. purty of the people of Dunedin, but they are the property of the people of the colony. They are the property of the people of the suburbs. and it has been suggested to-night that in Dunedin the voice of the people should be taken upon this question. Now, I am quite content to have that done, because I believe the voice of the people would be in favour of preventing that tramway going through the Gardens. But I say this: that the present residents in the City of Dunedin are not the people who should have the power to decide for all time as to what should be done with these reserves. They are reserved for the people of the colony, for the future as well as the pre- sent. It is said, "Trust the Mayor and Cor- poration of the City of Dunedin." What has been the history of the Mayor and Corporation with regard to our endowments and reserves ? I remember the Town Belt and the Botanical Gardens of Dunedin when I was a bos four years of age. and have ever since been familiar with that beautiful place. It is bound to me by ties of interest and affection, and by many happy associations. In those early days it ! the place unfit for people to visit. I refer to the M. T. Mackenzie was then a picture of surpassing lovelies. The Water of Leith meandered through a stately forest - clothed with pines, festooned by clematis, and fringed with the rarest forns. And what has been wrought ? These stately pines were cut down by order of the Corpora- tion of the City of Dunedin. The whole of those magnificent pines, that the artistic people of Dunedin so greatly admired, and fought to save in order that they might be preserved, because they knew they would never have an opportunity of seeing such a magui !:- cent forest restored to them, were cut down for the wretched value of the timber that was in them, and were used for protective work. Should we, after that, trust the Corporation of the City of Dunedin ? What have they done with the beautiful Water of Leith stream ? They made it into a sewer, into which sewage of the most offensive character was thrown. and until the Minister for Railways during the plaque alarm took the matter up, at my insti- gation, it was the great public sewer of some residents at that end of the City of Dune din. And this under the enlightened administration of the city fathers of Dunedin. Then, we have the allusion made by the honourable member for Bruce regarding their attempts on the Belt itself. They did succeed in obtaining a large portion for a cemetery, though he and land other members fought inch by inch against a large portion of that belt being taken away for cemetery purposes. Then the football ground for the town of Opoho was to be taken away to make a gravevard : and what came of the money for the allotments? The Corporation charged as much as $20 per allotment. Thousands of pounds of money taken for the sale of the re- serves of the people were spent on the Town of Dunedin -- the streets of Dunedin -- and not one farthing was ever replaced of that money to beautify the forests of the Town Belt of Dun- edin. Then, there were endowments and re- serves within the city itself. There was that tive-acre block in Great King Street, Cumber- land Street, Hanover Street, and St. Andrew's Street, taken away for the purpose of a hospital site : and there has not been a piece of endow- ment set aside that has not been threatened by the Mayor and Councillors of the City of Dun- edin not one reserve. And what have they done with their drains ? Why, they have made their foreshore nothing but a cesspool. Dun- edin, from being one of the loveliest cities of the colony, has been, through neglect and want of courage on the part of the Mayor and Councillors, almost stripped of its beauty, and has became so offensive through the want. of drainage as almost to be in some parts not fit for occupation. They have not even the courage to face the necessary reforms that are required in that town. They have not yet pro- vided any system of drainage. What are iliv doing now with one of the finest places of resort Dunedin has ever had ? They are taking ali tin wretched offaland exeretia out there, and making 
<page:93>
weted if we trust the Corporation of the City of Dunedin. Why, Sir, this policy of silence to-night ? Where is our junior member for the City of Dunedin ? And where is the medium member for that city ? We have not had one honourable member except the gentleman who moved this measure rising to say one single word in support of it. Mr. ARNOLD .-- We are waiting for you. Mr. T. MACKENZIE. -- The honourable gentioman is not waiting for me. The honour- able gentleman is in hopes that if some of the claus of this Bill are allowed to go without much comment and discovery, the Bill will be taken to its second reading; but we are not opposed to the Bill in its entirety, though we are strongly opposed to some of its clauses. The honourable member in charge of the Bill said there was no allusion to the taking of the lin through the Gardens. Why, Sir, although that point is not mentioned in the Bill, it seeks to grant to the Corporation the power of sending the tramway almost anywhere. Mr. ARNOLD. - Which clause ? Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- Beginning with the preamble, which savs .--- " Whereas the said tramways were, by several deeds and assurances made and dated the twenty-first day of March, one thousand nine hundred and one. transferred, conveved, and assured to the said Corporation, and are now, together with the several Orders in Council, concessions, and contracts relating to the said several tramways, and all the rights which belonged to the said company in virtue of ·ach several Orders in Council, concessions, and  contracts, absolutely vested in the said Corpo ration : And whereas the said Corporation, by Thomas Bolster Fairburn, its Town Clerk, some time since applied for, and on the sixth day of March. one thousand nine hundred and one, obtained. in the name of the said Thomas Bolster Fairbairn, the several mining privi- leges the licenses whereof are set forth in the First Schedule hereto, such mining privileges being granted in pursuance of and subject to the provisions of .The Mining Act. 1898."" Then. Sir, here is the power with the horoughs,- ". 4. In lieu of the interpretation of the ex- pression 'the suburban districts' in the said Act. the said expression shall be deemed to include, and as from the passing of the said Act to have included, the boroughs contiguous to the City of Dunedin, the boroughs in section five of the said Act mentioned, and the terri- tory of counties contiguous to Dunedin or to such boroughs." Now. Sir, just before leaving that section it leads up to section 5, which leads up to the taking of the line of tramways through the Town Belt. Sir, I doubt if even now-the doubt wa- raised by the honourable member for Bruce -- they have the right to take these through the Botanical Gardens, because I believe there is existing somewhere powers that vested a por- tion of that Town Belt either to the old Accli- flora and fauna. And let me say, in this con- nection, regarding these Gardens, that they have been for all time a preserve for some of the rarest flora and fauna in this country, and they are wisely managed by one of the most com- petent curators in the Southern Hemisphere: I refer to Mr. MeBean. They are essentially botanical gardens. There you will see some of the choicest and finest collection of our rarest plants. Botanists have penetrated our forests and scaled the alpine and sub-alpine regions. and have taken the finest specimens of our fora and entrusted them to the care of the Curator. There you may see Arundo, Celmisia, Senccio, Fagus, and Ranuncula. Then Panax, Pitto- sporum, Veronica, Coprosma, Metrosideros, and Podocarpus are largely represented: as well as Wahlenbergia, Cordyline, and Phormium. So that here we have now the botany of the country well and finely represented. Then, there are those beautiful ponds that have now become the sanctuaries for our wild fowl. It will hardly be credited that to those small ponds flocks of wild ducks come almost nightly. I have counted as many as fifty grey duck in one flock. I have seen the mountain blue duck, and occasionally the black, grey, and brown teal. and occasional specimens of the paradise ducks. The weka thrives there : the kiwi, the kakapo, and the pukeko are there also. I say that when you find grounds that are conserved for those purposes, when you find native birds coming there of their own accord- - and I have not mentioned anything like the birds you will find there -- you will find the kaka, the tui, the beautiful green tui (the native name of which is the mokomoko), the paroquet, the robin, and the warbler. Mr. BARCLAY .- The " green tui"? Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- Yes, the green tui ; it is known by that name by many settlers. The honourable gentleman has no idea of what a lovely bird is like. He has no eye for nature or the beautiful-constitutional law absorbs his whole attention ; but had he love for them, in the early morning his soul might often be clevated by the sweet and lovely melody of one I consider, Sir, of our choicest songsters. where you have reserves of that sort, where you have the flora and fauna well represented and preserved, you should do the best you can to still further conserve those reserves, and not interfere with them in any way. These grounds, as has been pointed out by the honourable member for Bruce, are the recreation-grounds for the people of Dunedin. Every Sunday hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of people congregate there, and during the week visitors from the country and abroad resort to those gardens, where they are highly delighted. There is no part of New Zealand which could be made more beautiful than this particular spot. Nature has done much for it ; and, as has been said by the honourable member for Wallace, in Taranaki they have those beautiful gardens. In Christchurch there are also beau- tiful gardens which attract visitors from all 
<page:94>
these endowments, and leave them entirely un- disturbed and undestroved. Now we come to clause 19- that clause which the honourable gentleman introducing the Bill stated had a verv innocent bearing, and was merely a con- solidation, I think, of section 10 of the other Act. This clause takes powers from the subur- ban boroughs that I, at any rate, as a member of the Borough of Roslyn, will certainly oppose in every direction. These are not the powers contained in the Tramways Act to which the honourable gentleman alluded ; they are more extensive powers, and they will have the right, if this is done, practically to cut our streets to pieces in any direction they think right. Why should this be the case? I sav, they are de- parting from the agreement made with the suburban boroughs in every respect. They hive got proposals before this House which. if carried, will altogether rob the suburban residents of privileges that were specified when certain statutes passed this House ; and there- fore I say it is not likely that we should allow such a measure to go through this House without raising our voice against it. That would be false to the interests we are sup- posed to conserve in this Assembly. I con- gratulate the member for Caversham on having the courage and self- denial to stand up for the rights of the suburbs which he so ably repre- sents in this House : and I hope we shall strike out those clauses which so perniciously threaten the interests of the suburbs of Dunedin. Then, regarding the remarks which emanated from the momber for the Taieri, I cannot fall in with what he said. I do not think that. be-  cause there may be some risk, the waters which rise in the Silverpeaks should not be nulised for the City of Dunedin. I think the honour- able member took up what might almost be called a dog-in-the-manger position in con- nection with this matter, because Silver- stream is not utilised to any extent. Mr. CARNCROSS. - A great many miles away from Silverstream. Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- You are proposing to use some of the water coming down from Silverpeaks, at any rate. In any case, we must have power raised somewhere; and I am quite sure if an accident occurs the City of Dunedin will have means to meet the contingency. The City of Dunedin is not like some tramway com- panies about Dunedin. I hope there will be a reserve fund set aside to meet cases of accident. In the case of some of the tramways, the un- fortunate people who were injured. I may say that I know of five or six people who were in- jured-some for life, and they have no redress, because one particular company simply says. " If you take action against us we will go into liquidation." Now. in the establishment of tramway companies Parliament should require that there shall be a sum set aside to provide for accidents. Debate interrupted. Mr. PIRANI. - May I move the adjournment of the second reading of this Bill until next Mr. T. Mackenzie rupted in the middle of his speech.

The Hon. Mr. SHRIMSKI asked the Minis- ter of Education,-(1.) Whether it is a fact that the officers of the Life Department of the Government Insurance Office are carrying on the accident insurance business ? (2.) If so, what amount has been paid or allowed to the Life Department by the Accident Department for the expenses of offices, et cetera ? (3. Whether the Government intend to give any explanation of the meagre profits allowed to the policy-holders of the Government Life De- partment compared with the profits allowed in other insurance companies ? He had put this question at the desire of a great many policy- holders of the Government Life Insurance De- partment, who were dissatisfied with the work- ing of that institution. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER said. in reply to the first part of the question, that it was a fact that the Life Department of the Government Insurance were carrying on to a certain extent the accident insurance business, As to the second part of the question, he might explain that the two businesses were kept quite distinct, and if there was any loss on the first year or subsequent years of the Acci- dent Insurance Department the Consolidated Fund was made liable, and not the Life Insurance Department. As regards the share of the expenses, office services, officers, et cetera. those amounts would be adjusted each year as the expenses accrued. As to the third part of the question, there was a great deal in it that was contentious, and he was not prepared to admit that the profits were meagre as far as the Government Life Insurance was con- cerned. There was no doubt that the pre- miums paid in the Government Life Insurance 
<page:95>
posals of the Government Life Insurance, as it was proposed to insure at as low a rate as pos- sible, in order to enable every one who wished to get cheap life insurance on the best security in the world-namely, the security of the colony- to do so. But even with the low premiums charged profits had accrued, and the policy- holders had benefited to a substantial amount in the way of bonuses. The Hon. Mr. McLEAN .- They do not com- pare with the A.M.P. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- The Go- vernment Life Insurance Department was not a business that touted like other offices. They were prepared to stand on their merits and leave the public to judge what the merits were. The only otce which could be compared with it in any shape or form was the A.M.P., and that was a very much older company. Its premiums were a great deal higher, and they had had in addition to that twice the length -he forgot how many more years' opportunity of investing money ; and also the magnitude of their business enabled them to give, he admitted, larger bonuses than did the Government Life In- surance. But, as he explained, it was not the original intention of the Government Office to go in for the bonus business at all. It. had grown on them simply because, with the low premiums they charged, profits accrued which bad to be divided. And he maintained that he must be a very unreasonable person if he was not satisfied with the management of the Go- vernment Life Insurance Department, con- sidering its low premiums and its very sub-  stantial bonuses-added to which the security of the State was at the back of all its contracts. He trusted the answer he had given would be satisfactory to the honourable gentleman. ## H. K. TAIAROA'S PETITION. The Hon. Mr. TAIAROA asked the Minister of Education. When the Government intend to bring in a Bill to give effect to the recommenda- tion of the Native Affairs Committee on the Etition of H. K. Taiaroa (No. 15, 189-), He reported upon on the 19th October, 1899? was sorry to have to repeat his question so often. but he trusted the honourable member would admit it was not his fault. He had not had an answer to it, although he had asked the question for two years. The land to which he referred was leased from about the year 1>60 by the Commissioner of Reserves, and there was no mention in the leases as to improvements : that was to say, there was no provision that the lessees were to be paid for the improve- ments on the land. Before the term of lease had expired he and his fellow-owners had is-ued to them the Crown grants for portions of the reserves, and about the same time there was passed by Parliament " The Westland and Nel- son Native Reserves Act, 1887," and that Act deprived the owners of the land of all the im- provements which had been made on their land. When the original leases terminated the land provements to the outgoing tenant. This had the effect of reducing the rent which the owners received from the land. This matter was then brought up by petition, which was gone into by the Native Affairs Committee, and was reported favourably upon. Part of the report read thus :- " From the evidence submitted to the Com- mittee it appears that the petitioners' interests in the land referred to (Subdivisions 1A and 2A, Arahura Native Reserve) have been injuriously affected by the operation of the statute referred to ('The Westland and Nelson Native Reserves Act, 1887'), which by its retrospective action has deprived the petitioners of the full control of their land, and also deprived them of the improvements made on the land, to which im- provements they would otherwise have been entitled." He would like to remind honourable mem- bers that at the time that Bill was before the Council he pointed out that the owners of the land would suffer injustice by the passing of the Act. He spoke so vehemently on the subject that the Speaker told him to resume his seat. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER was sorry he could not give the honourable gentleman any assurance that the matter would be taken up by the Government. As far as he was in- formed, although it was true that an Act was passed in 1887 which the honourable gentle. man contended took away rights which were his before that time, still the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal held that the absolute ownership of the land did not vest in the honourable gentleman and his family, and that the tenants held their right to renewal that meant prior to the passing of the Act, although it was confirmed by the Act of 1-87 - and that the land was to remain under the control of the Public Trustee. That was a long time ago. The property had been managed by the Public Trustee ever since, and he thought it would be only holding out false hope to the honourable gentleman if he were to say the Goverment would consider the matter of bringing in legis- lation to alter his position. Many other Native lands were similarly situated, and the Govern- ment believed that, in the interests of both races, it was better not to disturb the present position of affairs. ### TRAINING-SHIP FOR NEW ZEALAND BOYS. The Hon. Mr. JENNINGS moved, That the unanimous recommendation of both branches of the Legislature in farour of the establishment of a training ship for New Zealand boys be given effect to by the Government as speedily as Sir. the motion standing in my possible. name is one of such great importance that I crave the sympathy and support of honourable The proposal members of this Council for it. for the establishment of a training-ship for the colony has already met with a great degree of 
<page:96>
favour of it, and every member of both Houses of the Legislature that I have had conversa tion with is willing to support the establish- ment of such a vessel. Now. Sir. I maintain that the business of transporting passengers and merchandise is as much a productive one as the raising of wheat or the smelting and forging of iron. It therefore behoves us that, in regard to the training of our colonial vonth, they should have the same facilities for making themselves perfect in seamanship as in other occupations. The immense coast-line that exists about New Zealand. the deep waters that we have, and the other opportunities that exist indicate our destiny as a nation to become a maritime people. Moreover, the opportuni- ties that are presented to the boys of New Zea- land to learn occupations are, in my opinion, to a very great extent lessened, owing to a variety of causes. The great improvements that have taken place in machinery during recent years, and the general use of it in nearly all produc- tive industries, may be adduced as one reason. In the days of my youth boys were employed at many occupations in which they are not required at the present time. The expensive machinery required to produce a newspaper is such that the employers will not employ any but the most highly skilled and expert labour, as the value of the machinery will not allow boys to be employed to any extent. Now, in regard to the proposed establishment of a training-ship, the whole success of the experiment depends upon its being conducted in a proper manner and on correct lines, and I can only instance the case of the "Sobraon," the marine reforma- tory ship of New South Wales. I understand that several honourable members, during a     recent visit to Sydney at the Commonwealth celebrations, inspected that vessel, and I trust that they will give the Council the benefit of their experience. The results achieved there prove what one man can accomplish when he has his heart in the work. Members will be surprised when I tell them that 93 per cent. of the lads who have passed through Commander Mason's hands have turned out to be good mem- bers of society: so that it can be safely said that the " Sobraon " training-ship experiment has turned out a monumental success. If lam wedded to the proposal that the training-ship should be a marine reformatory, it is because I feel that on a training-ship a career of honour- able distinction lies open to the larrikin or truant. It is mere recklessness of spirit that in many instances leads the larrikin to the edge of degradation and crime. therefore they should not be readily condemned and the brand of criminality placed upon them. Honourable members have probably read Kipling's book called " The Fore and Aft," in which a read- able story is told of the two little blackguard drummer-boys, fourteen years of age, who, had been picked up from the gutter, and who with patriotism strong within them, by their courage and example, absolutely saved the regiment Hon. Mr. Jennings doubt whatever that many of those youths that are supposed to be refractory, or are truants and absconders, have feelings of patriotism, and would turn out good men in time of war. Sir, it may be asked, what would be the cost of obtaining a vessel or vessels necessary for the purpose indicated by my motion. I think that a vessel suitable for a marine reformatory could be obtained as a gift if a request were made to the Imperial authorities by our Government. 1 had the opinion of a gentleman holding a very high position in His Majesty's navy that no difficulty would be placed in the way of obtain- ing an obsolete war - vessel. It would be a gracious act on the part of the British Govern- ment to present one of these vessels to our colony. It will probably be asked what would be the expense of working a vessel and paying a master and crew for, say, a hundred boys. I have worked the figures out. The cost of a hundred boys at $20 per head per annum would be $2,000; I would allow 5500 for con- tingeneies, such as repairs, paint, et cetera ; and for master, mate, and crew another $1,000 would be required. Therefore the total cost for the vessel would amount to $3,500 per annum. In regard to the question as to whether a second vessel should be used as an auxiliary to the larger vessel. I think that a properly equipp: d vessel similar to the one just built for the New Zealand Government, called the "Counters Raniurly," should be obtained. Supposing that a vessel of 60 tons were built, the cost of building per ton being $20, we should get a vessel for €1.200. The master, crew, and super- numeraries for this auxiliary vessel would cost about €1,000 per annum ; and the cost for the maintenance of fifty boys on this vessel for the vear would be $1,000. I therefore estimate the total cost of both vessels per annum at about €7,000. The larger vessel should be moored in Wellington Harbour, where the classification of the neglected and refractory boys could take place. They would be under strict discipline and cut off from shore communication. As they be- came advanced and showed a desire of benefit- ing themselves they could be drafted to the auxiliary vessel. The real criminal children- those that would be found in the industrial homes badly tainted-I would keep in one of the industrial homes on the land, and would not allow them to mix with those on the vessels at all. Sir, after a certain time on the auxiliary vessel I should allow the Government de- partment to have the right to put these boys on vessels-to apprentice them on vessels that are registered in New Zealand and are trading here, or, if they desired it, on vessels trading co Home ports. We could also utilise a number of them on our own fleet. At the present time. I am glad to say, our fleet is increasing. We have the " Hinemoa." the "Tutanekai," the " Countess of Ranfurly." and the " Ellen Bal- lance." The lads could be utilised as time went on on our own Government vessels, and they would prove useful in this and in other 
<page:97>
tunity of entering the British navy if of good of them. And the report of the officer in charge character, according to a statement made by Captain Leah before the Select Committee that was set up some two years ago. Sir, I have found out that the number of boys in rsidence in industrial homes in this colony - and at first I could hardly understand what that meant -- is as follows : At the end of the year the number was 337, and the cost per head per annum for each boy was from $18 to $21 10s. I have also a return from the Customs Department, which gives the figures of registered vessels employed in home -that is, coastal- and foreign trade at the 31st December, 1900. They are as follows : Sailing- vessels. 301; gross tonnage, 43,585 : steam- vessels, 219; gross tonnage, 94,182. These figures do not include steamers in river service. Sir. I may say that the Ports of Auckland and Dunedin stand out distinctly in the Customs returns, as I find that, out of a total of 520 vessels registered throughout New Zealand, 350 are registered in the Ports of Dunedin and Auckland. The number of persons employed in the vessels registered total 3,704. This does not in any way fully give the number of persons connected with marine occupations. Let me instance the fisheries, and the Jumpers, and men connected with shipping offices. I think I am safe in saying there must be fully ten thousand persons gaining their living in this colony from being attached to maritime pursuits. Sir, I will not trouble this honour- able Council any further. The question has been debated fully on previous occasions, and it has always met with the acceptance of mem-  bers of each branch of the Legislature. I submit the motion to my honourable friend who represents the Government, hoping and trusting that something will be done in regard to this important question, which is of very great interest to many in this Colony of New Zealand. Sir, I move the motion standing in my nanie. The Hon. Colonel PITT .- Sir, I have much pleasure in supporting the motion of the Hon. Mr. Jennings, to which he has just addressed himself. I, probably with other members of this Council, had the opportunity when in Sydney lately of being on board the "Sobraon," and witnessing the great success that ship is in dealing with the reformatory question in that State. There are, I understand, some three hundred and fifty boys on board the vessel, and each of those lads has been committed by a Magistrate. Any one seeing them must be struck with their cleanliness, with their discip- line, with their health, and with the general good that is aceruing to those boys through the manner in which they are dealt with on board that ship. Their education is attended to. They are taught some part of a sailor's life, not. perhaps, so much as might be were they on board a different class of ship, for it is more a school than a naval training-ship, but their physical development is attended to. They have their cricket-ground, their football-ground, their swimming-bath, and everything that conduces VOL. CXVII .- 6. of the ship, Captain Mason, is such as proves incontestably that the very greatest benefit is derived, not only by the lads but by society, from the establishment of that ship. And, Sir. it has this advantage, to my mind : it is the best solution that I have heard of vet of the indus- trial school difficulty. On board that ship these lads are mixed together. all creeds are there, and the spiritual instructors of all the denomi- nations go on board that ship - - Roman Ca- tholies, Church of England, and other denomi- nations visit the ship at different times and give religious instruction there. The lads are also taken ashore from time to time to attend their different places of worship, and there is no difficulty whatever ; the whole thing goes on in perfect harmony. They have a splendid band on board, and the perfection of the drill on the "Sobraon " is such that I venture to say I have not seen better anywhere. If you speak to the officers of the ship they will tell you that very few of these lads ever relapse into crime, and that a great many of them have turned out really useful members of society. I believe the proportion of them who go to sea is, perhaps, not so large as might be expected. Probably that is because the "Sobraon " is simply moored in the harbour, and they are not trained to the more active portions of a sailor's life. They are taught knotting and splic- ing and sewing canvas, and other things of that kind, and manning the yards, but they are not exercised in the practical working of a ship. Now, what I think we ought to do in this colony - what, with all respect, I think the Government ought to do ; and I suppose that no time in our history have we ever been in a better position to do it- is to ask the British Government to place one or two obsolete sailing.vessels at the disposal of our Government, and then all the advantages which are enjoyed by the lads on board the "Sobraon " in Sydney could be en- joyed by lads placed on board those vessels here. And, more than that, if a vessel of the class of the "Skylark " or the " Nautilus," naval brigs which, probably, members have seen sailing out of Plymouth -- if one of such vessels was engaged here the lads could be put on board and taken short cruises, say, from here to Lyttelton and back, or elsewhere. Then, our mercantile marine could be recruited from these boys ; and, as the Hon. Mr. Jennings has said, the Imperial navy would probably draw a great many very useful recruits from our training- ships. I know it has been asked, Why cannot all the advantages boys get on board a training- ship be obtained on shore? Well, perhaps that is a difficult question to answer. I merely answer it by the light of our experience. Our experience shows that it cannot, for I venture to say that our experience of industrial schools throughout the colony has not been that they are a very pronounced success ; but if we get from a training-ship the same results that they have got in Sydney from having a training-ship there we ought to be satisfied, and it is no answer to say that you could get the same 
<page:98>
training-vessel. And we should not forget, also, that we are a maritime colony, that we are a colony circumscribed with a coast-line, and we ought to look forward, I think, to developing lads trained and with a taste for a maritime life. Not only could we recruit our ordinary mercantile marine, but also we should be able to some extent to assist the recruiting of the Imperial navy. I do not know how it is, but evidence was given before the Federation Commission by, I think, witnesses either in Wellington or Dunedin in reference to the young New Zealand lads who are apprenticed to mechanical engineering ; whether it is from the education they receive here in the school, or from their natural mental capabilities, or from the mode of instruction they receive in the foundries I cannot tell, but the evidence given most emphatically before us was that any young man in these foundries, after he has passed his apprenticeship-or what is tantamount to his apprenticeship - is always sure of a good position on board a steamer as an assistant in the engine-room, and I have no doubt what- ever that a very large number of our youths from New Zealand hold very good positions in the mercantile marine of this and other colo- nies and throughout the world. Therefore I am very strongly of opinion that it would be an excellent thing for this colony if we could get one or more of these training-vessels here, and it is well worth the trouble of the trial. I do not think the expense to the colony would be very large, and I should hope and believe that the Imperial Government would place at the  disposal of the Government of this colony freely and cheerfully one or more of the obsolete ships, which would be the very thing we want in this colony for this purpose. The "Sobraon " is a very large vessel, and cost the New South Wales Government, I think, some £12,000. We do not want so large a vessel, and we could begin modestly at first. I am one of those sanguine in the matter, and I believe that ultimately it will turn out a great success. hope this resolution will be agreed to by the Council, and that the Government will give effect to it. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- I think I have already stated this session that when in Sydney I was very pleased to go and see the "Sobraon," and what our party witnessed there was most encouraging. The boys were bright, well-controlled, clean, happy, and all that boys ought to be, and it was a sight that I would not have missed for a great deal. But the honourable gentleman who has just pre- ceded me has asked the question that I have asked myself, What is there that makes the difference between a training-ship and an indus- trial school on shore? That is the difficulty. Because, given good managers, the same re- sults ought to accrue either on shore or on the water. An Hon. MEMBER .- Oh. no. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .-- Well then, if you do not admit that, you must admit that Hon. Colonel Pitt on shore, and that humanity generally-even adult humanity -- is better and purer on board ship than on shore. Of course, if you admit that, you admit certainly a great part of the premises. Possibly masters and teachers are better on ship than on shore ; but that is the problem that I have been unable to get a satis- factory answer to. We do our best to fit up industrial schools on shore, with good managers and teachers, and we do all we can to make the instruction useful and the discipline sound and good, and surely if we have got the right men we ought to get just the same results as they do on board ship. There are, I will admit, two points of difference. In the first place, senti- ment, of course, has a great deal to do with boys' lives, and I believe, myself, that the clothing of these boys in the King's uniform -- for they are dressed like little men-of-war's- men-has an unconscious effect on their lives. and that they try to live up to what they believe to be the traditions of the profes- sion. I quite admit that ; but, still, we can put our young fellows in a uniform on shore and see if that would not have the same effect. Of course, there is another advantage in having the school on the water, and that is that it is a prison, and yet it does not look like one. Bows cannot run away from a ship, even though it is anchored in a harbour, whereas it is a con- stant trouble with a certain class of cases that on shore they are always trying to run away. and we are compelled to treat them absolutely as prisoners, which is the very last thing we want to do. I admit on those two points there is something to be said in favour of the in- dustrial ship as against the industrial school on shore. As regards it being a school which will in any shape or form add much to our growing maritime population, I do not believe. The Sydney authorities could not give me much that was very convincing on that point. In fact. they admitted that they sent boys into the country, and that the number that finally I went to sea was comparatively small. I am quite certain that last year, in proportion to the number of our population, we sent as many boys to the sea as the Sydney people did. I believe we are sending away as many boys to the sea as can get away in any case, and certainly as great a proportion as the Sydney people do. Therefore I do not think there is much in the argument that we would be adding to our sea-going population. much as I admit the desirableness in a country like this of our doing everything to encourage a sea - going population ; because the sea is our privilege. it is our heritage, and it is our defence, besides being the means of livelihood for many of us. So that from every point of view we ought to consider our obligations to the sea, and we ought to always keep in view the propriety of training as many of our sons as are suitable for it to do their work on the salt-water. I do not think the Sydney experience will encourage me to say that there is very much difference whether we have our school 
<page:99>
said the expense, I look upon it that that i- almost beside the question, because I fool quite certain that, if the country were satisfied that a training-ship should be established, neither the country nor the Government would grudge the expense. What is more, it would be only the initial expense, because once the ship was established it could be managed just as economically as an institution on land. So I do not attempt to answer that part of the qration at all. But I wish to be certain, in the first place, that there exist good reasons why we cannot train these boys -as most of the i go to farming pursuits -and that we can- not train them better and make better men of them here on shore than if we tried to put them on the sea. I think we ought to. There is another point, suggested both by the Ho. Mr. Jennings and the Hon. Colonel Pitt, and that was as to the possibility of the training on these ships being an entrance to the Royal navy. That is absolutely impossible. They will not take into the royal navy a boy who has been committed by a Magistrate, nor www. from a school where committed boys are aanmitted. Therefore I do not think it is possible to consider that view of the matter at all. However, I must leave the decision as to this motion to the Council. It is an important subject, and it is one that the Government feel to be important. I have stated my views, but I shall listen with respect to the views of hon urable members, because my only desire is to ver these schools made a permanent good to the community and to the boys who are com-  mitted to their care. The Hon. Mr. SCOTLAND. -- I have been very much impressed by what I have heard fran the honourable gentleman who has just sat down. From my point of view as well as from his there really is little or no difference between a training-ship moored in a harbour and the establishment on shore of a reformatory for young criminals. Something like the scheme sketched by the Hon. Mr. Jennings, I remem- her, was tried many years ago at Kohimarama, in the neighbourhood of Auckland, and, if I am not much mistaken, the scheme came to grief. I think there were many cases of young people abounding from the ship because the discipline on ward was rather too severe. However, the Hon. Mr. Jennings. I have no doubt, knows more about that training-ship than I do. It was given up a great many years ago. As far as a ship moored in the harbour is con- comed. I venture to say that it is no nursery for seamen. Putting a number of bois on board, and teaching them to go up and down the ropes like so many monkeys or acrobats, is not training them to become hardy seamen. Look at the lives of some of the greatest of England's seamen, who dis- tingnished themselves at a time when it was not the custom to look to the Government to initiate everything. Men were then left more to their own initiative. Take the life, for in- stance, of Captain James Cook-a man whose He ran away from his home or his employer I forget which. Of course, I do not approve of boys running away, as a rule, from homes. He then got on board a collier on the coast of Eng- land, and there he led a rough life for some years, antil he became a thorough, hardy British seaman. Or take the case of Horatio Nelson, a man born in a different class of life to Captain James Cook. Where was the beginning of his training laid ? In the same manner as the beginning of James Cook's life. He went on board a vessel on the coast of England : he actually entered the merchant service before his father, or his uncle, obtained for him a commission in the British navy. That was the way to train sailors ; and 1 only wish that there was more self-reliance amongst us nowadays, and that we did not so continually look to the Goverment to spend large sums of money to begin experiments of different kinds. I do not see that there is any obstacle in the way of a boy who wishes to go to sea in New Zealand. Look at our ports, and the number of coasting vessels you see about, and the vessels trading to the Islands : what is to prevent a boy getting a berth on one of these vessels ? I am sure many captains would be glad to take a respectable boy on board. An Hon. MEMBER .-- They cannot take more than they have. The Hon. Mr. SCOTLAND .-- I do not believe that there would be any obstacle in the way. If a boy were determined to get on board a vessel he could get on board, even as a stowaway -- that is, if he were determined to be a sailor. As to establishing a training-school for the British navy. I think there is too much of this talk in New Zealand just now. People are going Im. perialistic mad almost. Look at the number of young men who have returned from the war in South Africa, and who are thrown back on our hands in New Zealand. Will a majority of those young men go back to their old pursuits and settle down to steady industry ? I venture to say that a great many of them- and I say it with sorrow- are, by too much coddling and flattery, spoilt for life : too many of them will want to be officers and gentlemen, and to be maintained at the Government expense, or to have Government billets found for them. If they cannot got such billets what is to become of them ? I think it is a very serious outlook. I say, if we are to train young men to the sea, let it be for the mercantile marine of New Zealand. I only hope that if we do esta- blish a training-ship here it will not form the nucleus of a New Zealand navy. We really do not want it. But, as we are sometimes told that money is no object for us, who can foretell what extravagance we may not enter upon ? We have got the nucleus of a standing army already. The arguments for this training- ship seem very specious. Some honourable gentlemen can say a good deal in favour of the proposal, no doubt ; but, so far as arresting young people on the road to serious crime goes. I think the words of the honourable the Minister of 
<page:100>
harhours. They may be useful to teach the bovs habits of cleanliness, respect for discipline. and deference to superiors, but all that can be brought about by establishments ashore, some of which we have at present, and we can have more, if the necessity arises for them, which I hope will not be the case. The Hon. Mr. McLEAN .- - I hope that the honourable gentleman who has brought this matter forward will go on pressing it until he succeeds. Sir, it deserves much more encou- ragement than was given to it by the Minister representing the Government in this Council. That honourable gentleman bogged the ques- tion entirely, and the last speaker has evidently not been paying attention to the Bills which we have been passing, and which he has helped to make. He ought to know that, if it were not for the Bills passed by this Council, we would not require a training-ship, for we could then train our own sailors. The honourable gentleman should therefore look into the legis- lation that is being passed, and he will see why boys cannot be taken aboard our ships and steamers. That being so, why should the Goverment refase. to establish a training- ship for our young men ? This being a mari- time country, surely this is the place where we ought to train our own sailors. I am sure there are very many of our boys who would readily take up the profession if they had the opportunity afforded them of doing so. They would not require to run away like Captain Cook and Lord Nelson, as described by the Hon. Mr. Scotland, The Minister of  Education said that as many boys went to sea from our industrial schools as went from the " Sobraon." I maintain that very few of our industrial school boys go to sea, and I would like to have a return upon the subject. What is wanted for our boys is a training-ship to take them from port to port ; this would give them a knowledge of what the sea is like. Under these circumstances, they would take to the sea kindly, and the sailors turned out from such a ship would be very good indeed. The other day we had here an Argentine ship which was on a cruise round the world for the purpose of training officers. That was an example for our Government. An Hon. MEMBER .- They were being trained for war. The Hon. Mr. McLEAN .- For war or any- thing else. If they are discharged from the warships they make good sailors. I feel that our boys should be encouraged to go to sea, so that they might become man-o' war's men if they felt that way inclined. Even if parents had to pay a premium to get their boys on to a training-ship it might be a success, if the cri- minal class were put aside altogether. Plenty of the boys committed to our industrial schools have no taint of crime, nor have their parents. A large number of such boys could be selected from our industrial schools. Therefore I feel | young men in the ships, and we ought to get Hon. Mr. Scotland ship at Kohimarama was carried on would say that it could be made a success. Judg- ing by the way the school was managed, I am perfectly satisfied that it was never intended to make a success of it. It is only such people as the Hon. Mr. Jennings and others like him, who take a deep interest in these things, by visiting the ships and en- couraging the people on board, that make a success of them. 1 do not wish to enter any further into this question, but I would urge the Government to look into it in quite a different way from what they have done. I hope they will see the necessity of manning our own ships with our own boys. Moreover, they should not be debarred from entering any of the trades. Our industries are slipping from us one by one for the want of encouraging our boys to enter them. If we are to deal seriously with this matter, technical education will have to be taken in hand in quite a different way from the pre- sont system. With all the workshops in the colony open to train our boys in the trades, there should not be any necessity for getting a hundred railway carriages from America. They should have been made by our own bovs. I again say that all our own sailors should be trained here. What is happening now? Why, we are 1 shutting up our boot and shoe works. Every one knows that one apprentice to three journeymen will never half maintain our industries, let alone increase them. Something must be done to stop our industries declining. I would now like to say, in regard to the Arbitration Court, that they have taken a new departure in con- nection with the boot trade. The flood-gates have been opened, and the country has been inundated with boots from outside factories. They are now taking steps to try and retrieve our lost position, and I hope they will succeed ; but I doubt it. When you once open the flood- gates it is not easy to shut them. Well. Sir, we cannot train our boys for the sea on our vessels, and therefore we claim that the Go- vernment should get a training-ship. and train these boys, so that we shall have sailors belong- ing to New Zealand. There are bors all along the coast of New Zealand who would make splendid sailors if they were only taught on a training-ship that might go from port to port. By that means we would have splendid sailors, and we could have them trained at no great expense. How is it that such a num- ber of tiremen have taken to the sea from New Zealand ? There is no trouble in getting fire- men in New Zealand. Young Now-Zealanders -- the sons of "cockatoos " and others- who have worked for their fathers without any pay for years, offer for this work, and the steamers are being filled with them. Now that the vessels are filled with this class of people, you do not hear of ships being stopped and unable to get to sea because of the men being away drunk. You do not hear much of that now.

have to serape up the "seum " from the outer world, from any port where you can get them ; for when they were employed ships every now and again were stopped, and you had to hunt everywhere for your firemen in order to get tham on board. Now, what I plead of every one is: to open the gates of our industries to our on young people, train them up to our own industries, and do not let us rely on the outside world for people to do what we can train up our own young people to do for us. The Hon. Mr. JENKINSON. . I am very gli indeed to be able to give my hearty sup- port to the motion of the honourable gentle- man. Like some other honourable members, I. too, had the privilege and satisfaction of visit- ing the "Sobraon " in the Sydney Harbour, and I must say that, although I was before con- vineed of the urgent need we had in New Zealand of a training-ship, I came away from that vessel more fully determined to give my strongest support to the Hon. Mr. Jennings, who has taken a prominent part in this matter, whenever the question came up, to get it pushed further on. I hope that this time, at any rate, his efforts will be successful, though I am very much afraid not. The Council, I think. from the remarks of approval that we have heard going round, is fairly convinced that a training-ship is a necessity in New Zealand, and that honourable members will lend the honourable gentleman every support, as I shall do myself. Now, Sir, I was talking to two or three of the leading lights in the engineering world regarding the boy question : it was more in reference to the question of   32106019788246 apprentices, and the number of applications from boys who are willing to be apprenticed to the different trades, and my information from them was that the number of boys who wished to enter the engineering trade in prefer- ence to any other trade simply arises from the fact that when engineers have served their time they have a better chance of going to sea, and they state that the boys are anxious to go to sea, and that they drift into engineering as a means of getting there. As the Hon. Mr. Mbean has pointed out just now, I believe there is no other means of their getting there tx. pt, perhaps, as firemen; but then they must be beyond a certain age, at any rate not boys. I think that most of the ships already have the number of boys allowed by law, so that there is no way of their getting to sea until they have served their time as engineers, and then they can get a job in the engine- room. Regarding the institution of a vessel on the same lines as the "Sobraon." I do not know that it would altogether suit the views even of the Hon. Mr. Jennings. It is, I think, too much on the lines of a reformatory. As far as I can remember, every boy on the "Sbraon " is committed to that ship by a Magistrate, and is kept there for a number of wears he is committed for-two, three, four, or An Hon. MEMBER .- The Superintendent can 't his discharge when he is fit to go. at a very young age, very young indeed ; and we were surprised to find the oldest boy on board was not over the age of fifteen or sixteen. I do not think that would meet exactly our views with regard to a training-ship. As the Hon. Mr. MeLean has said, for a training-ship to be of any benefit to us, we must have a sailing ship, for use in conjunction with the training-ship, in which the boys can gain some practical knowledge of navigation and seaman- ship. I should like to see the Government steamers now made more use of for training lads in seamanship. Now, they do not get that on board the " Sobraon," and I do not think it is intended they should get it. They are kept there just as they would be in- well. a prison ; but it occurred to me that I had never seen a happier looking lot of lads. They did not seem to have any fear of the officers who were above them, and they seemed to do their drill with pleasure, and, as the Hon. Colonel Pitt has stated, one could not see better drilling anywhere. Of course, discipline reigns su- preme ; that is one of the strong points of the school, and so it ought to be. I do not : think the honourable member intends that we should have no industrial schools in the colony. I am in favour of having both a training-ship and industrial schools ; and I think the indus- i trial schools should be for a different class of boys to those we put on board a training-ship. As to the matter of the expenditure, the Hon. the Minister has said that he did not consider that at all. Well, I am glad to hear that, and I wonder why the Government have not taken the matter in hand, when the expense is so trivial. It is only the question of getting a ship or a couple of ships to start with ; and we know-for it has been proved to us beyond \- doubt by the success of the training-ship in Sydney - that the outcome will be beneficial. I cannot understand why the Government \-- has not obtained a training-ship before. They could get one easily, I am sure, from the Admiralty, and it would not cost much to put it in working order and to place the boys on it. I am quite sure that, if the Bill we have before us were on the statute-book-the Re- ferendum Bill-and the question was submitted to the people, a very large majority would vote in favour of having a training-ship at once. I only hope the Government will take some prac- tical action in this matter. It is all very well for the Minister to say he is in favour of it to a certain extent. I would hope that all the Ministers in the Cabinet are in favour of a training-ship. If all the members of the Cabi- net would pay a visit to the " Sobraon," I believe they would come away fully convinced of the excellence of such an institution, and be unani- mously in favour of it, and then we should have a training-ship at once. I hope the honourable gentleman who moved the motion will go on, and, although I have my doubts that he is going to be successful this time, I am willing to give him every aid I can in the matter, because from what I saw of the training-ship over there -the very excellent way it is managed and 
<page:102>
one in New Zealand. I will support the motion. The Hon. Mr. BOWEN .-- The Hon. Mr. Scotland asked whether boys could not be as well trained on shore as on ships. Well, that is really the whole question. There is a certain class of boys who have been found unmanage- able in existing institutions, and we have had a very large experience of all sorts of industrial schools on shore. Discipline is better managed at sea than on shore, and it is easier. The boys recognise that there must be discipline at sea, whereas on shore they seem to have the notion that it is a tyranny-that every kind of discip- line is tyranny ; and so they become mutinous and run away, or get out of control one way or another. At any rate, it has been found that as yet no industrial school in New Zealand has been managed satisfactorily, or in such a way as the ship " Sobraon " is managed. But even there a serious shortcoming was pointed out by the honourable gentleman who introduced this motion. He informed us that the " So- braon " is only a stationary ship, and that provision should be made besides for a sea- going ship. I have no doubt that that would very greatly increase the value of the system. Again, it was suggested -- I think it was by my honourable friend the Minister - that if you put boys into a uniform on shore they would be just as well pleased as with the uni- forms at sea. I think it would be quite a dif- ferent thing. They would feel that the uniform on shore was only a sham -that they were not, and were not intended to be, soldiers. But they do believe they are being made sailors on sea, and have a right to the dress of sailors. They begin to feel that they are learning the busi- hess that may be their occupation for life, and are proud of their profession. Although a good many of them do not stick to it afterwards, the influence of the training in the ship is good. This system of training is not confined to Aus- tralia. There are training-ships in England, and they have been the greatest success pos- sible. As far as the navy goes, I have heard naval officers repeatedly bear testimony to the worth of the men from the training-ships. They say that the British Navy never was better manned than it is now, and that these young men are as good fighting material as any of the old salts who fought our battles a century ago, and far more steady. Training-ships have turned out a great success as far as the navy goes. The only fault is that there are not enough of them, but it is intended to establish them on a much larger scale. Then there are also the training-ships for the mercantile ser- vice. There are two distinct sorts of training- ships-in fact, there are three. There are ships for those who are being trained for the rougher work of the service; there are ships for the training of those who hope to get into the higher ranks of the service; and there are also the penal training.ships. The penal ships are not just such as we have known in this hemi- sphere, even the "Sobraon " and others. That Hon. Mr. Jenkinson No one ever believed for a moment that it was being carried on on a system that would make decent sailors. There was not even good discipline, and the whole thing was an absolute failure. But I have known of no case where boys were put into a ship to be trained as seamen, and disciplined accord- ingly, that they have not turned out better men than they would have done under any other system. We can only judge from what we have seen, and I think every honourable gentleman will admit who has seen it -- and I had some opportunity of seeing it in England - that, in every case where a fair sea-training has been given and the boys have been put under sea discipline, they have improved immensely, and that there were very few relapses ; whereas Goodness knows how many relapses have taken place in the reformatory schools we have had ashore. As here, so in England : such training schools on shore have not succeeded as well as those at sea. Therefore I do hope that the Government will make further inquiry into the matter, and I trust that my honourable friend who has brought the matter up will bring it forward again and again, until a fair trial is given to training-ships. The Hon. Mr. MONTGOMERY .-- I think the Hon. Mr. Jennings deserves great credit for his perseverance, and the knowledge he has brought to bear on this subject. I have lis- tened to what honourable members have said about this country being a maritime country. Well, Sir, I am not so sure of that, for the present generation at all events. I am going to vote for my honourable friend's motion : but what we want to consider especially in regard to these training-ships is what kind of boys are going on them. Are they boys who are merel; guilty of what my honourable friend calls truancy, or is it for those convicted of petty larcency, because I earnestly hope that they will not make our sailors from those guilty of petty larceny. It should be an honoured pro- fession, and if we are going to send those con- victed of petty larceny to be sailors, I say that those who go from that training-ship will not be regarded with much favour. If you expect boys to go to these ships you must say what are the inducements for them to go, and what are the inducements for them to remain at sea. Boys get from 12s. 6d. to 15s. a week on farms, and they are engaged as fast as they offer. What inducement is there, as far as wag's are concerned, for those boys who go to wea. and what is the inducement for fathers and mothers to send a boy away out of their own ken to go aboard a ship? I point this out in- cause I do not think a training-ship will indnet boys to go voluntarily aboard that vessel. I come back to the point, and I will ask the Government to consider, if this proposal is car- ried, that they are not going to mix up truant boys with those guilty of petty larceny. If it is those boys who have been neglected b. their fathers and mothers -- who are, strictly speaking. orphans dependant upon the care of the State- 
<page:103>
board that ship than is provided in the reforma- tories on shore ; and I also agree that instead of boys being discontented, as they are in some cases on board ship, they will consider that they have a future before them, and endeavour to do their duty in a straightforward and honourable way. Debate interrupted. LAND FOR SETTLEMENTS BILL. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .-- Sir, this Bill deals with a question that is, to some extent, a matter of urgency. The sooner mat- ters of this kind are dealt with the better, because the Bill is, to a certain extent, the result of experience. It has been found that certain parts of the machinery relating to the acquiremeut of land for settlement requires amending. I believe that a Bill of this nature always goes to the Waste Lands Committee for report, and, therefore, perhaps the Council will not be disposed at the present stage to debate the second reading. If the Council will allow it to go to the Committee I will refrain from going into the details of the measure at the present stage. I beg to move, That the Bill be rt ni the second time, and be referred to the Waste Lun is Committee. Bill read the second time. # REFERENDUM BILL. ADJOURNED DEBATE. The Hon. Mr. JENKINSON .- When I moved  the adjournment of the debate yesterday I did so in the hope that my honourable friend Mr. Jones would be here to-day to discuss the ques- tion. but I regret to say he is still unable, through illness, to be present. I know that he had made preparations to discuss it at some length, and I was also living in some hope that he would have given us some good reasons for voting for the Bill. I must confess that after reading the Bill very carefully, and after listen- ing to the debate yesterday, I am bound to admit that there is very little in the Bill itself to cause a person to say that it is required at all : quite the opposite. There are one or two clauses which were touched on by the Hon. Mr. T. Kelly and other honourable mem- bers, providing that certain questions may be submitted to the people ; but we have that now, because it was suggested recently that a certain question-namely, that of federation -- should be submitted to the people, so that even these clauses seem to be unnecessary. Therefore, I cannot conceive why this Bill should be brought forward at all. It appears o me to be thoroughly unworkable, and if it is read a second time it will, in my opinion, have to be entirely altered in Committee. As to the referendum as contained herein, even if a measure is passed twice by one House, how could an intelligent answer be got from the country as to why every word of it should be- ! direct vote of the people upon ? None at all, Sir. before this Council, and the House has probably had to amend Bills coming from this Chamber before they could be put on the statute-book. If one or two Bills that I am thinking of had been referred to the ballot, it is difficult to say how they would have been treated. I do not see any provision whereby any neces- sary amendment in such a Bill could be made after it has been referred to the people ; and to say that a Bill, after passing the House a second time, should go to the country, and, if a majority is found to be in favour of it, that it should absolutely become law without Parliament having power to amend it, is, in my opinion, a wrong proceeding, and I do not think that any honourable member in his sober senses I was hoping that my would agree to it. honourable friend Mr. Jones would give us some reasons why we should vote for the measure. We have had none yet, and, unless honourable members who follow me give good reasons why this so-called Referendum Bill should be supported, I must vote for the amend- ment of the Hon. Mr. Arkwright. The Hon. Mr. KERR .- Sir, I rise with some dittidence to speak to the question before the House. It has taken me some time to come to consider whether or not it has been sent to this House with sincerity. I am rather inclined to the opinion that it has been sent here for the purpose of employing our time, and also, pro- bably, to give us a little amusement. It cer. tainly appears to me to be somewhat farcical. I think that we have already referendums suffi- cient for the requirements of the country. The referendum of the general elections is, in my opinion, sufficient for all purposes. We know very well that when candidates do not keep their promises to their constituents they seldom come back again. That was demonstrated last. general election, when a large number of those who held positions in the House were retired to make way for those who were more in accord with the views of the people, and who were prepared to advance the liberal measures for the prosperity and good of the country. That is a referendum we have an opportunity of exercising every three years, and, unless the term of Parliament is extended, I say that each general election is often enough to take a re- ferendum on general questions. It is a well- known fact that this is the first time a so-called reform of this kind has been submitted to the Council, and I would ask where is the necessity for it ? This Council has never refused to sane- tion any measures that have been truly and earnestly advocated by the people. Measures have been sent back once or twice until they were more conversant with them, and more in touch with the subject they had to legislate upon ; but there is no Bill that the country made a determined effort to pass which did not eventually pass. What have we done in the way of legislation during the past few years ? Are there any Bills that we should have got a 
<page:104>
people ; and that have in many ways placed us in a position far before that of the other colo- nies. That being so, why do we want the referendum ? Is it for the purpose of undoing the good we have done ? Surely not. We have passed the cheap money law, which has been a godsend to a great number of people in the colony; and not only has money been distri- buted to those who applied to the Government for it. but the price of money generally has been brought down, so that any man who wants an advance can now get it on reasonable terms. We have also passed the Factories Act, which is one of those Acts that stand out pro- minently for the good of the workmen. Owing to the labour laws that have been passed, work- men are now sure of a living wage ; their hours are regulated, and much has been done to ele- vate them to a higher level. This Council has advanced with the people in promoting laws for the general good. If more referendums are wanted, then it is within the power of the people of the colony to have a referendum. There is the right of petitioning Parliament, and we know that petitions had a great effect some years ago when the question of granting the suffrage to women was under consideration. I believe that it was owing to the number of petitions in favour of that measure that a num- ber of honourable members in this Council saw there was a general desire on the part of the women of the colony to have the franchise, and they accordingly voted for the measure in the end. In passing. I should say that I did not vote for that measure; and I may add that I believe, if a referendum had been used then, the question would have been negatived. Fur- ther, we have Royal Commissions to see what is the will of the people, and they go round the country taking evidence. We have labour unions and other different associations band- ing themselves together, and, when any ques- tion affecting their interests is before the country, they make their voice heard, and take care that every consideration is given to it. Therefore, unless there is some ulterior motive for the promotion of this Bill, I cannot see that it is required at all. There is an old saving, "Trust the people." Why, Sir, the people have trusted Parliament-they have sent men here to do their duty, and if they do not. do so they will not be sent back again. But are they doing their duty? It seems as if they cannot trust themselves, for, according to this Bill, they require to be instructed. They wish to go to the people and say, " We are in a dilemma ; we wish your advice on this question. We are unable ourselves, from all the evidence we can obtain, to come to a conclusion." What will the constituencies say ? They will say. .. We selected you as men of ability, as men of knowledge, and we sent you to do your duty for three years ; do your duty and come back to us, and we will tell you whether you have gained our confidence or not ?" That is a referen- dum that should be sufficient for any one. Hon. Mir. Kerr majority of the voters should be. We will say there are 100,000 voters in New Zealand, and if a question were put before them -- probably a question involving many technicalities-one- half of the population would not vote, nor do I think would one-twentieth of the population ; but still we must go to an expense of $30.000 or $40,000 to obtain from merely a section of the voters an expression of their opinion. The thing is preposterous, for the expense involved would be as great as for a general election of members of Parliament. Can this colony afford to throw away money like this ? Take, for in- stance, the question of " Whether brother Bill should marry deceased brother Harry's widow." Would not that be a nice question for the colony to get a vote on by referendum ? Not one in a thousand people would ever trouble themselves to vote on the question, notwithstanding the fact that it had been before this Council on two or three occasions. Members, however, saw that there was no great harm in it, and it was passed ultimately. Then, take such a question as the Divorce Bill- a Bill that I was strenuously opposed to. I ask, Are you to put such questions as these before the voters of the country, at an expense of $30.000 or €40,000 ? The thing is monstrous, and we should not be doing our duty if we permitted a Bill to pass that would permit this to be done. I hope such a law will never appear on our statute-book. Now, in thinking over this matter it struck me that it is proposed to make drastic changes and alterations in the Constitution, because, as sure as this Bill is passed, I am certain it is only " the thin end of the wedge " for something else. It provides-that is, if people care to have it so -that "the tail should wag the head." If drastic measures are wanted. why not abolish the Upper Chamber altogether, and have thirty men chosen from the different constituencies to represent them in the Lower House ? Then et those representatives elect an Executive and submit every paltry little question that comes before them to the people, and let the people instruct them. Why, Sir, if we pass a Bill like this, we are not representatives of the people at all ; we are simply automatically worked by some of the people ; for I am confident that not one out of twenty of the people would go to the poll on many questions : but if they did. and if there were two or three questions on the ballot-papers, there would be as many informal as valid votes. At the present time, when the ballot-papers are so simple that there can scarcely be any doubt as to the intention of the ballot, there are a number of informal votes on every occasion. For these, and for many other reasons. I strongly oppose the Bill. Now, Iam not generally given to opposing Bills that emanate from the other House I am generally inclined to support them ; and. of those Bills which I have supported, I can shake hands with myself and say that every one of them has been of benefit and of use to the colony. I have striven strenuously to advance 
<page:105>
it for that purpose ; but when it comes to this Bill it is a different matter. It does not con- cern me personally, for before this Council is abolished I shall very likely be abolished myself, and many honourable gentlemen are in the same position ; but still I believe this Bill has a clause in it by which this Chamber could be abolished without its own consent. I do not approve of it. I believe we are as Liberal as the members who occupy seats in another place ; that we are as closely in touch with the people of the colony; and that we can now even give those members a lead in matters of Liberal polities : and while we are in a position to in- darse, to alter, and to make suitable their Bills, I think we have the right to remain here, and to do the good work we are called upon to do. Sir, without saying anything further, I shall support the amendment and vote against the motion for the second reading of this Bill. The Hon. Mr. T. KELLY. Sir, speaking to the amendment. I wish to correct a statement I made on a former occasion. I stated there was no national Government that I was ac- quainted with where the referendum was adopted. I was then corrected by my honour- able friend Mr. Rieg, who said that it was in Switzerland. On looking over the Constitution of Switzerland, I find that I was, to a certain extent, in error. Although the Federal Govern- ment itself has not the option of the referen- dum, it can be compelled by the cantons to use it before Federal laws which may be objected to have legal effect. Article 89 of the Federal  Constitution states : --- " Federal laws shall be submitted for the acceptance or rejection of the people if the de mand is made by 30,000 active citizens, or by eight cantons. The same principle applies to Federal decrees which have a general applica- tion and which are not of an urgent nature." To a certain extent I was wrong in making the statement. I also stated I was in favour of this Bill going into Committee; but upon ex- amination of the Bill I find that it is of such a dangerous character that I will vote to reject it on the second reading. And my reason is this : I can see in this Bill a latent power which may possibly be used to abolish this Council without this Council's consent. That is possible under the Bill. If a Bill is brought into the other House by Governor's message to abolish the Council. if that Bill passed the other House and is rejected by the Council, and again passed by the House of Representatives, and again rejected by the Council, it may, under the Bill, be sent to the electors by referendum. and if the electors confirm it, then the Bill is placed in the same position as though it had been passed by both branches of the Legislature ; but, being a repeal of a section of the Constitution Act, it has to be reserved for His Majesty's assent. and if that assent was given this Council would be in a fair way of being abolished without its consent. Now, I think that is a power contained in the Bill which does not appear on the face of it. I Debate adjourned. STATUTES REVISION COMMITTEE. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER asked leave to move, without notice. the addition of names to the Statutes Revision Committee. He found out this morning, after the Committee met, that the other House had added five names to their list of members. The practice was that the Committee was composed of an equal number of members from each House, and he would therefore ask the Council to pass the following motion : "That Standing Order No. 162 be suspended, and that the names of the Hon. Mr. Aikwright, Hon. Major Harris, Hon. Vir. Louisson, Hon. Mr. Pinkerton, and the Hon. Mr. Scotland be added to the Statutes Re- vision Committee " Leave to move without notice given. The Hon. Mr. FELDWICK, while seconding the motion, thought it his daty to call attention to the great evil that was arising. The Council was under a system of having to cover what- ever number of members for joint Committees the other House chose to put down. The effective numerical strength of the Council was only two-thirds (or less) that of the House, and it was exceedingly inconvenient. In the case under notice, the joint Committee would consist of over thirty members -- a little Parlia- ment in itself, and very similar to the Educa- tion Joint Committee set up many years ago, which, in the end. as the result of additions, numbered between thirty and forty. He could not, by any possibility, understand what object there was in making the Committees so large. If they could go in the direction of reducing the number of members on the Committees of both Houses they would be doing a very good thing. His own view was that, so far as joint Committees were concerned, there should be about seven from each House The Hon. Mr. BOWEN quite agreed that the number appeared to be very unwieldly ; but there was no doubt that the Minister had been forced into the position of moving the addition of the names by the fact that the House of Representatives had added five names to the Committee, and it was necessary that the Council should be represented by an equal number. That was the universal custom. A joint Committee of thirty members was ex- ceedingly unwieldy, especially for the revising of statutes; but it would never do for the Revision Committee of each House to sit separately, because the great value of a joint Revising Committee was that members of both Houses consulted together, and those who attended that Committee could make the same explanations to their respective Houses as to the reasons for any proposed amerdment. The progress of Bills through both Houses was thus greatly facilitated. That advantage would be lost if the Committees sat separately. The Hon. Mr. SHRIMSKI said, Nodoubt they were justified in protecting themselves against 
<page:106>
for the other Committees, and there must be neglect somewhere. He agreed with what was now being done to protect their own interests, but they were short of a great number of mem- bers to attend other Committees. Motion agreed to.

Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston). -- Sir, before the reports of Select Committees are considered I desire to raise a question of privilege. This morning I was in attendance at a meeting of the Counties Bill Committee in the Joint Com- mittee Room. When that Committee had ter- minated its deliberations a meeting of the Pub- lie Accounts Committee was held. I did not upon public accounts -- which is not very much -as one can get in this House. The Clerk commenced to read the minutes, when the Premier interposed and said that he ob- jected to any member of the House being present while the Committee were hearing the minutes read, and he proceeded to elaborate at some length his objections to my presence, in a way I considered to reflect upon me as a mem- ber of the House. He said, if a member was not on the Committee and was present when the minutes were being read he would know what had taken place at the previous meeting, and he might thereby become acquainted with matters which it was not right that those outside the Committee should know. He thereupon asked the Chairman, Mr. Fisher, to order me to with- draw. In accordance with his desire, the Chairman did so. Mr. SEDDON .- You are leaving out the resolution as passed by the Committee. Mr. PIRANI .- I am coming to that. I am giving you an accurate account of the pro- ceedings. I refused to withdraw, mainly on account of what the Premier had said, and I stood on my right as a member of the House to be present during the deliberations of a Com- mittee of the House. The Premier then moved that the Committee proceed to deliberate on the 1st clause, as he called it, of the minutes. The motion was solemnly put to the meeting by the Chairman, and a division was taken, when, I think, three or four members voted for it, and two against. The Chairman then ac- quainted me with the decision of the Com- mittee, and said they were deliberating, and that in accordance with the rule I should with- draw. I again refused to withdraw from the Committee-room, standing on my rights as a member of the House, and I said I would not leave the Committee until the Chairman produced a Standing Order showing his authority to order me to withdraw. The Com- mittee looked around and up and down, and did not seem to know what to do. The Premier then proposed another motion -that the Com- mittee should proceed to deliberate on clause 2 --- I think it was --- of the minutes. This was also solemnly put by the Chair, although, with the exception of the Premier, all the other members treated it as a great joke. That was again carried with the same numbers as in the case of the previous motion, and the Chairman very politely acquainted me with the resolution, and suggested that I should withdraw. I again stood on my ground, and pointed out to the Com- mittee that my action was not without prece- dent -- that at a meeting of the Bank of New Zealand Cominittee the same attitude was taken up by a member of this House, and that attitude had been upheld. The Chairman of the Bank of New Zealand Committee, who is a member of the Public Accounts Committee, was to-day asked by Mr. Guinness what his opinion was of my action, and he very clearly and unmistakably said that I was right. After a lot of trouble a 
<page:108>
mittee is examining witnesses, but with- : would do it at his own risk. Of course he did draw by courtesy when the Committee is : not choose to risk it. But I do say it is a deliberating." I stated that, as the Committee had shown me no courtesy, in accordance with the Standing Orders, I did not intend to show them any, and I maintained my right to be pre- sent at the meeting. I have since also looked up the authority on these matters, and I find that May, 1593 edition, is stronger even than our wn Standing Orders. On page 886 of May it is stated,- " Members of the House of Commons have claimed the right of being present as well during the deliberations of a Committee as while the witnesses are being examined ; and, although, if requested to retire, they would rarely make any objection, on the grounds of established usage and of courtesy to the Committee, they ought immediately to retire when the Committee are about to deliberate; yet it appears the Com- mittee, in case of their refusal, have no power to order them to withdraw." And, further, on page 287 May points out, - " As members cannot be excluded from a Committee-room by the authority of the Com- mittee, if the occasion should arise the Com- mittee must apply to the House for power to effect their exclusion. At the same time it may be observed that such applications are not favourably entertained by the House." So far so good, and probably I should not have taken any offence at the action of the Com- mittee had it not been for the subsequent pro- ceedings. When members remember that on that Committee were present such burly speci- mens of humanity as the Premier, the honour. able member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher). and the honourable member for Caversham,     they will understand that, at any rate, so far as physical proportions were concerned, there was no necessity to call for outside interference to expel me from the Committee-room. Still, there was some hesitation. The Premier looked first at the Chairman and then measured the proportions of the honourable member for Ca- versham with his eve, and said, " Well, we must do something to get this member out." But nobody seemed to know what that some- thing was. Then the honourable member for Caversham moved that the Committee adjourn to take the opinion of Mr. Speaker : and the Chairman suggested that they should leave the room and leave me in possession, go to an adjoining room, and lock the door so that the honourable member for Palmerston could not get in. An honourable member pointed out that this could not be done, and then - which I con- sider the most offensive part of the proceedings the Chairman (Mr. Fisher) suggested that he .. should send for a policeman to enforce the desire of the Committee. Of all members in the House to suggest such a thing, surely the junior member for Wellington City is the last. I do not think he meant Commissioner Tun- bridge to be sent for, but he suggested they should send for a policeman ; and the honourable Mr. Pirani breach of the privileges of this House that any member, no matter what position he holds, should suggest seriously on a Committee that. in defiance of our Standing Orders and May's rulings, a member of the House should be turned out of a Committee-room, so as to pre- vent his listening to the minutes, by a police- man. The House has come to something! I do not think it right in the interests of the House --- personally I do not care a button for any threats-but I do not think it right that a member of the Public Accounts Committee should be allowed to threaten a member of the House in the way the Chairman did. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) .-- What was the final result ? Mr. PIRANI .- When the Committee had finished this little pienie and found themselves utterly powerless I got up and said, " Now, gentlemen, as I have had my own way, by courtesy I will withdraw while you deliberate on your minutes." Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) .- I think it an unequalled parody and a gross abuse of the forms of this House that a trumpery incident of this kind should be elevated to the dignity of a question of privilege. One could under- stand if the honourable member had just reason for insisting that he should be allowed to remain to witness or to listen to the procced- ings of a Committee-one could understand that he should be allowed to remain to witness the proceedings of a Committee if he had an honest desire in some manner to further the interests of the Legislature or the interests of the State -- one could understand the henour- able member so persisting in remaining if he desired honestly or honourably to forward the interests of his constituents or of the public in general- one could understand all that if he were imbued with any honest inten- tion; but throughout his conduct there was no semblance of such a desire. It was a parody, bereft of all sense or humour. When the Com- mittee saw that the honourable gentleman re- mained in the room in an attitude of deliberate defiance. and not from a deshe to honestly gain information from the proceedings of the Com- mittee, they naturally felt very greatly annoved. As I have said, there could have been no objection to any member remaining in the room for the purpose of gaining information : but one cannot understand an honourable member remaining in the room out of pure "cussedness," and a desire to set the Committee at defiance. Such conduct would irritate and annoy any Com- mittee. True, the Committee was in a dilemma through the pranks-one cannot call them an- thing else of the honourable gentleman, and it is painful to me, when a member relates with pride and satisfaction such circumstances as the honourable member for Palmerston has related to the House to-day, that certain mem- bers who regard themselves as paragons of 
<page:109>
Pablo Accounts Committee, should be found lanching merrily at the parody the House has been compelled to listen to this afternoon. a-k any man of honourable mind and feeling - ins man of delicate susceptibilities - what his foolings would have been if his conduct had been of such a questionable kind that the Premier of the country and the Com- mitt as a whole found itself compelled to request him to withdraw from the room. What, then, can be the character of a man who declients to withdraw from a room when re- quested to do so ? I put it to the member for Bruce. Mr. Allen, and the member for Waka- tipu. Mr. Fraser, who encouraged the honour- alde member for Palmerston in the course he chose to take, that suppose I had been the member who persisted in remaining in the room. in opposition to their requests that I should withdraw, what would be their opinion of m ? I think I know the character of the honourable member for Bruce sufficiently well to say that he would have considered me an imondont and impertinent person, and I add to that that he would have been quite justified in so classifying me. That is the view I take. I have been a member of this House for seven- teen years. I have never intruded myself upon the proceedings of any Committee. Whatever ma be my reputation on the floor of this House, I feel entitled to say that I have such respect for members of Committees and their proceedings that I am sure no member can say that I ever intruded myself upon the pro- c:edings of any Committee. Whenever I have appeared before a Committee, either in charge of a petition or as a witness, I have always paid the greatest respect to that Committee, and so ought every member of this House. We are bound by the Standing Orders of this Hous to pay the strictest regard to the rules of debate and the courtesies due from one member to another ; and we have a Speaker whose duty it is to see that no insult or con- :umele is offered to any honourable member. And. Sir. if the proceedings of this House are protected in this way, why ought not the pro- ceedings of a Committee to be so protected .- particularly the Public Accounts Committee. which is generally conceded to be the most important Committee of the House? I say -- without heat or warmth or imparting any teeling whatever-I say the presence of the honourable member for Palmerston at the meeting of the Public Accounts Committee this morning was an unwarrantable intrusion, de- liberately intended to be offensive; not be- cause he - Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce). - I rise to a point of order. I wish those words taken down : " an unwarrantable intrusion deliberately intended to be offensive." Those are words which ought not to be used in regard to any member of the House, and I wish them taken down. Mr. SPEAKER. - J do not think they are such unparliamentary words as that the House honourable member for Wellington City has done, but I am not disposed to order the words to be taken down. Mr. FISHER .-- I am so anxious to conclude that i must express my sorrow that the matter was brought before the House at all. i merely wish to add, since you. Sir, have expressed a desire that the matter should be brought to a conclusion as speedily as possible, that there was no business before the Committee in which any member outside the members of the Com- mittee could have any possible interest. We had not proceeded beyond the reading of the minutes, and there was no business before the Committee on which any person other than the members of the Committee had any concern. Therefore there was no possible justification for the member for Palmerston remaining in the room while the Committee were deliberating upon the question as to the correctness or otherwise of the minutes of the business transacted at the previous meeting. Mr. SPEAKER. - I think it is regrettable that a conflict should have arisen between the Committee and the member for Palmerston, but still I must say that it appears to me that the honourable member was within his rights in insisting on staying in the room. At the same time I am bound to observe that. after long experience in this House, I have always con- sidered it customary for members of the House to withdraw from the deliberations of a Com- mittee when requested to do so. 1 think the honourable member for Palmerston seeks to make out that he was not asked courteously to withdraw, and he was incited by the manner in which he was asked to withdraw to uphold his right of remaining in the Committee-room. Mr. J. ALLEN .- His right was denied : that is the point. Mr. SPEAKER .--- It is clearly laid down in May's "Parliamentary Practice " that the Committee, in case of members' refusal, have no power to order them to withdraw. The general custom is, if a member is asked to withdraw, that he does so. I do not know whether there was any lack of courtesy shown to the honourable gentleman when he was asked to withdraw. He says he was treated discourteously, and then he was within his rights in insisting on staying. The Chairman did not make any reference to what I consider the most offensive part of the matter -- namely. the threatening to call in a policeman to re- move a member of the House from the Com- mittee - room. Probably the Chairman will explain that point. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City). - If you, Sir, paid careful attention to the opening re- marks of the honourable member for Palmers- ton, which no doubt you did, you will remem- ber that in those opening remarks he himself stated that the Chairman politely intimated to him what was the desire of the Committee - namely, that he should withdraw. Those are his own words, and that is the actual fact. I 
<page:110>
that kind of language took place after the conversation had degenerated into a very poor kind of joking. Mr. SEDDON (Premier). . I am not going to be a party to elevating the honourable member for Palmerston and putting him upon the rack as a martyr, and making it appear to the world that he is an injured individual. What occurred was this : The member for Palmers- ton had evidently been engaged in writing or doing something, and I thought he had not noticed that we were about to proceed with the business, having been in the room before the Committee met, and I then asked the Chair- man if he had not better call Mr. Pirani's attention to the fact that we were about to read the minutes. Mr. PIRANI .-- You are wrong ; it was after the minutes were read. Mr. SEDDON .--. No. We had not read any minutes at all. An Hon. MEMBER .- The Clerk was reading the minutes. Mr. SEDDON .- The Clerk had hold of the book. because you will remember I moved that the Committee should deliberate on clause 2 of the minutes ; and to say that we had read the minutes-well, I cannot understand why any one's memory should be so defective. I say we had not read a single minute. The Clerk had hold of the book. He took the book up in front of him, and I called the attention of the Chairman to the fact of Mr. Pirani being pre- sent. Mr. HERRIES .-- I rise to a point of order. Mr. Speaker having given his ruling on this subject, if all the members of the Committee give their version of what occurred the debate     will be an interminable one. Will other mem- bers be allowed the same opportunity of speak- ing. in view of your ruling, Sir? Mr. SPEAKER .- If other members of the Committee who have not spoken manifest a desire to do so they will be in order in stating their views as to what occurred. Mr. SEDDON. - It is always the case that if he thinks he can obtain an advantage over me the member for the Bay of Plenty likes to do so, but surely, as my name was mentioned. I should be allowed to give my explanation of what occurred. I do not deny the same right to other members. I say there was no dis- courtesy intended, and there was no discourtesy shown. When the Chairman first asked the member for Palmerston to withdraw I had called his attention to the minutes, and I used these words : "If members, when we are deal- ing with matters of a delicate character, hear the minutes read they become acquainted before other members with the nature of proceedings which have to be laid on the table of the House, and this is not in accordance with the Standing Orders." If members go to a Committee and sit there until the minutes are read they be- come acquainted with the proceedings of the Committee, and are thus in a better position Mr. Fisher to keep to himself. An ordinary member of the House is not bound to do so. An Hon. MEMBER .\~ Yes, he is. Mr. SEDDON .- An ordinary member of the House is not. I have heard that argument used before. We have had members of the House who considered themselves not bound by the deliberations of the Committee. The honourable member for Palmerston complained of the "policeman " proceedings. It was sug- gested that we should leave the room and go into another room and leave the member for Palmerston outside the door, but I said, "Certainly not. We will do nothing of the The best thing for us to do is to go sort. on, and let the matter be reported to Mr. Speaker, and take Mr. Speaker's opinion upon it." Then one of the members moved. I think, that we should adjourn and take Mr. Speaker's opinion on the matter, but we de- cided to go on. And I consider that this Stand- ing Order No. 224 is of a permissive nature. Members of the House may be present when the Committee is examining witnesses, but must by courtesy withdraw when the Committee is deliberating. That occurred. and the Chair- man said we were about to deliberate in respect to our minutes. I say that even now there is a dispute as to whether what took place at a meat - ing is correctly recorded on the minutes. But it really is only a matter as between the members of the Committee. As to what transpired. and regarding the confirmation of the minutes, there could be no objection on the part of a member to retiring until we confirmed the minutes. We expected that courtesy would have been shown to us; but, now that this matter has been brought up I say, as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, or of any Committee, that if members will go there while minutes are being read I shall not take these matters before the Committee, and I say further that it is owing to this that the utility of the Public Accounts Committee is entirely destroyed. I assure the House that but for this I would take the advice of the Committee on financial mat- ters. I should refer financial matters to them, and I would be quite prepared to leave the matter entirely to the Public Accounts Com- mittee and the members of that Committee, and I am quite prepared to alter the order of reference ; but if other members of the House who are not on the Public Accounts Committee are to be allowed to come there when delicate financial operations may be under discussion, I say I cannot be a party to doing that under existing conditions. That is what I say. Mr. J. ALLEN ( Bruce) .- Sir. I have only a few words to say. Practically the Chairman of the Committee has admitted all that the honourable member for Palmerston has placed before the House. He has not denied the details of what took place as given by the member for Palmers. ton, and I think the only point that wants clearing up, or one of the points, is this : that the member for Palmerston before he received 
<page:111>
with a full knowledge of what took place, that it was only after the member for Palmerston had conceived, and rightly conceived, that the Committee had not a proper knowledge of the Standing Orders and of his rights, and desired to deny him his right, that the member for Palmerston showed any discourtesy whatever - not that I think he showed, even eventually, any discourtesy. What really took place was this : The Premier has said that the minutes were not read. He is partially right and par- tially wrong, for the minutes were being read, and it was after the reading of the minutes had been commenced that the Premier suddenly took notice of the member for Palmerston. He got up then and said, " L cannot allow the minutes to be read while the member for Palmerston is here." Mr. SEDDON .- I did not say that at all. Mr. J. ALLEN .- The Premier did say that. He said. "The member for Palmerston must withdraw "; and it was only when the Premier sought to deny the right of the member for Pal- merston to be there that the member for Pal- merston insisted upon his right. The honour- alle member actually got up and was about to quote the words of the Standing Order. before a copy of the Standing Orders was brought to us, that he could only be asked to withdraw by courtesy. And I believe the member for Pal- merston was going to say that if his right to be present was not denied he was perfectly willing to withdraw. The honourable member was on the very eve of saying - when he was inter-  rupted - that he would by courtesy withdraw if his right to be there was not denied. The point we want to establish is this, and I understand. Sir. by your ruling, that it is established : that a member of the House has a right to be present when the minutes are being read. The first question raised was on reading of the minutes ; and afterwards the question was again raised on an absurd motion moved by the Premier, that we should go into deliberation on the minutes clause by clause --- I do not know whe- ther there were any clauses in the minutes- with the object of showing and proving to the member for Palmerston that he had no right to be there when the Committee were deliberating. The Premier backed down on the ground of reading the minutes, and took up the question of the honourable mem- ber's right to be there when the Committee were deliberating. Now, Sir, I was astonished at the Premier going so far, because he must have some recollection of what took place a few years ago. Perhaps his memory does not go back to the year 1895, but I will refresh his memory in respect to 1895. He will recollect the Banking Committee of 1895, and a some- what similar question cropped up at that par- ticular time, and the Right Hon. the Premier is reported in Hansard, on page 230, to have : any member of such Committee, or by any other said as follows ;- " However, the Jomt Committee has met, ; and we found this-and I am quite right, I now consider that the matter complained of think, in relating it : A member of the House the bank to remain." Sir, a member of the House is to be denied the right to remain when the Committee are deliberating, but the Committee are to have the right to ask an outsider to remain -- the Presi. dent of the bank. And then, the Premier goes on to say ;-- "The member of the House then present refused to leave unless every one else left." " Mr. ALLEN .- Quite right too. "Mr. SEDDON. We believe that member was quite within his rights. A member can stop there if he likes; he only leaves by courtesy." Well, how different from 1895 is the Pre- mier's action to-day. The member for Palmers- ton's right to be there when the minutes were being read was denied to him, and when he had to back down on this, the Premier took up the question of the Committee deliberating, and sought to deny then the right of the honour- able member to be present. Sir, I am glad you have ruled on the point. I am quite sure the member for Palmerston did not intend to be discourteous ; he would not have been had his right to remain not been denied, and had he been treated with courtesy. It was only after the way he was treated that he was forced to take up the position he did, and, I think, quite rightly too. Mr. SEDDON .- I rise to a personal explana- tion. It is quite customary when a statement has been made in this House to accept it. I deliberately stated in my few remarks that I was not in any way discourteous to the member for Palmerston. There was no feeling at all in the matter : and I said so at the Committee. My own opinion was that the member for Palmerston had not noticed that we were going on with our business. That is my own con- viction, and I simply drew the Chairman's attention to it, and I did it without any feeling. I only did it because I considered -and still consider-that when the minutes are being read a member should by courtesy withdraw. If I had not I would not have taken the course I did in moving that the Committee proceed to deliberate on the minutes. Mr. PIRANI .--- May I be permitted to ex- plain that the discourtesy of the Premier that I complain of -and he repeated it to-day in his remarks-is his statement, aimed at me, that a member, not a member of the Committee, would go about publishing the proceedings of a Committee. No more discourteous thing could be said than were in the remarks made by the Premier in face of Standing Order No. 229, which says,- "The evidence taken by any Select Committee of the House, and documents presented to such Committee and which have not been reported to the House, ought not to be published by person." Mr. SPEAKER. -- I think the House will has been sufficiently ventilated, and that the 
<page:112>
although a member is within his rights in re- mining in a Committee-room. still I hope the custom of Parliament will prevail, and that when a member is properly reminded that it is advisable he should withdraw that he will comply. ## RETURNED TROOPERS' FARE FROM SYDNEY. Mr. MCLACHLAN (Ashburton) asked the Minister of Defence. If it is true that his office is deducting from the pay of returned troopers of the First Contingent who came home by way of Sydney the sum of $3 10s., being their pas- sar-money from Sydney to New Zealand ; and, if true, why so ? He had received his informa- tion on this matter from one of the troopers who had returned to the colony by way of Sydney. After returning to the colony he was ill in bed for a time, and when well again . he made what he considered was a reasonable re- quest for back pav. and was then informed that a sum of $3 10s. had to be deducted for passage- money from Sydney to New Zealand. It was certainly most extraordinary that the Govern- ment should take up such an attitude in the matter. The men were sent away with every mark of jubilation, and were warmly welcomed back, but when they were landed in Sydney they had to pay their own fare to Wellington. He hoped the Premier would see that this money was not deducted from the men at all. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said one story was good until another was told. The  position in this instance was this : The Im- perial Government arranged the passages of the men to Wellington, and when the men reached Sydney they left the transport of their own motion, and came over to New Zealand by another steamer. Consequently, they had to pay their own passage-money from Sydney to New Zealand. It was for their own con- venience that the men left the transport. They gave orders for their passage-money ; and, that being so, why should the Government be called on to pay their fare over to New Zealand? It was a responsibility the men took on them- selves. Mr. MCLACHLAN said the first steamer did not come to New Zealand-the " Harlech Castle." Mr. SEDDON said the "Harlech Castle " was to come to New Zealand, but the Govern- ment stopped her and made other arrange- ments. The departmental reply to the honour- able gentleman's question was as follows : - " A deduction of $3 10s. was made from the pay of certain men of the First Contingent for their passage from Sydney to Wellington by the s.s. ' Moana.' The men had guaranteed payment of their passages if allowed to return by that vessel." There was nothing more to add to that reply. It suited the mon not to stay in Sydney, and they left by another steamer. They gave orders Mr. Speaker NEW ZEALAND ENSIGN BILL. Mr. MONK (Waitemata) asked the 8.30. Premier, If he will reintroduce the New Zealand Ensign Bill for the purpose of altering the wording of section 4 into the phraseology which should be used, as directed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, pro- viding that the Act shall not come into opera- tion unless and until the Governor notifies by Proclamation that it is His Majesty's pleasure not to disallow the same, and that thereafter it shall come into operation upon such a day as the Governor shall notify by the same or any other Proclamation ? At present the matter of the New Zealand flag was in abeyance, and nothing was being done to end the suspense that was at present existing. On reading the correspond- ence that had passed between the Premier and the Deputy Governor on the Ensign Bill the House passed last session, it seemed to him that they required clause 4 to be altered as shown in the question on the Order Paper, and there need be no delay in the passing of the necessary amendment this session. He hoped the Premier would put the matter in hand, because at present there was a great deal of doubt and confusion on the subject on the part of our public schools, municipalities, and the general public, and certainly the matter required a settlement, which would be effected by the alteration of clause 4. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said the best way of answering the question would be to ask Mr. Speaker to allow him to give notice to intro- ' duce the New Zealand Ensign Bill. ARBITRATION COURT. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) asked the Premier, If he will have more satisfactory arrangements made for the sitting of the Arbitration Court, or, failing this, if he will reorganize the Court so that the present long delays may be done away with ? A similar question was asked in the House a year or two ago, and we were then told that the pressure of business on the Court was passing away, and that the proceedings of the Court would be more regular. He feared that the pressure of business had not passed away, and one of the difficulties in connection with the Court- and as it at present existed there would always be this difficulty- was in hearing cases as soon as they ought to be heard. Some of his constituents had made complaint to him about the difficulty of getting a case heard in the Arbitration Court. Already nine months had passed away without their case being dealt with. He thought it was a case of breach of award. It was obvious that if nine months passed away without time being found for the hearing of a breach of award the Court was useless. The second part of his question referred to some reorganization of the Court altogether, so that those working under this law might have some benefit from it, and not be deprived of the benefits of the legislation. 
<page:113>
cases dealt with within a short time they found them standing over for months. Against that, if they had appointed another Judge to take Arbitration Court work they might have orders and awards varying in different parts of the colony. Or, if they had a Judge appointed for the South Island and one for the North Island, there might be a difference in their awards. Honce it was necessary to have one Judge sitting as Judge of the Arbitration Court. He had thought, himself, and was led to believe, that the work would be overtaken, and he could only say that he would do his best to get that satisfactory position at- tained. He regretted the delays that had taken place, but, unfortunately, just after the ap- pointment of the Judge of the Arbitration Court had been made, the absence of one of the Supreme Court Judges from the colony neces- sitated the work of the Arbitration Court being to that extent set aside ; and then, in addition to that, the Appeal Court sat, and these circum- stances prevented the Judge of the Arbitration Court from overtaking his work there. How- ever, he felt sure the President would do his best to overtake the work and remove the unsatisfactory state of affairs now existing. Apart from that, he thought that in respect to the Conciliation Board's proceedings there was room for improvement. In his opinion, so many cases and so many persons being cited meant riding the thing to death. He thought there ought to be more Court, less Board, and more conciliation. GOVERNOR OF FIJI'S SPEECH. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) asked the Premier, When he intends to lay on the table of the House the answer to despatch No. 87 with regard to the speech of His Excellency the Governor of Fiji at the opening of the Wainibokasi Hospital ? Despatch No. 87, from His Excellency to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, was dated the 27th November last, and enclosed a memorandum from the Premier himself, in which he called attention to this now celebrated speech. He (Mr. Herriest had looked into the despatches from the Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, which had been laid on the table, and he saw no indication of any answer given to this despatch or to this memorandum. He thought it was important that they should have it. as they were about to discuss a motion, of which the Premier had given notice, with regard to the Governor of Fiji's speech. There was a despatch from the Secretary of State to the Governor of Fiji, and a copy of that des- patch was, he believed, sent to His Excellency the Governor of this colony. He trusted that, if the Premier had had no answer to the other matter, he would agree to the copy of the despatch from the Secretary of State to the Governor of Fiji being laid on the table. VOL. CXVII .-- 7. honourable gentleman referred came under the head of " Confidential," of course he could not possibly lay it on the table of the House. What was intended was the reply to the despatch sent from the Secretary of State to the Governor of Fiji, and that would be laid upon the table. It was his intention to lay it on the table before proceeding with the debate on the Fijian reso- lution. He was only speaking from memory, but he was inclined to think there was some more correspondence, but that it was under the head of " Confidential. " # MEMBERS OF RETURNED CON- TINGENIS. Mr. WITHEFORD (Auckland City) asked the Minister of Defence, If the Goverment will take steps to obtain a list of the names of mem- bers of returned contingents desiring to obtain employment in the colony? His reason for asking this question was that he believed tho Premier only required to know the names and addresses of those members of returned con- tingents who were desirous of obtaining em- ployment in the colony in order to provide them with that employment. On every occa- sion that he had communicated with the Go- vernment on this matter they had done their best to assist returned members of contingents in getting the employment they needed. He trusted the Minister of Defence would obtain the names of all members of New Zealand con- tingents who desired to obtain work. If the Minister of Labour would act in concert with the Minister of Defence, he was quite satisfied they would have this matter properly carried out. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said a list of the names and addresses of members of contingents applying for work was made. The officers commanding the districts were also keeping lists of applicants and of employers requiring men. As to those returned troopers who were previously in Government employ, there was a standing instruction that they should take the places they left before going to the front. In regard to Government employ, it had been decided that preference should be given to members of returned contingents, other things being equal. Then, in respect to private employment, the Government were ascertaining where men were required, and were endeavouring to get them back to their ordinary avocations. The sooner they were enabled to take up their ordinary avocations the more pleasurable it would be for them- selves and for the people of the colony. The Government would do their best in the direction indicated. MANGATORO ESTATE. Mr. O'MEARA (Pahiatua) asked the Govern- ment, If they will acquire the Native rights of 11,000 acres at present held under lease by tho Assets Board as part of the Mangatoro Estate ? 
<page:114>
definite answer from the Premier, if it could be given without causing complications, as to whether it was the intention of the Govern- ment to acquire the 11,000 acres. He under- stood that there were only two Natives at present interested in this block, and they were desirous of selling it at a reasonable price, and, as they had plenty of land apart from this 11,000 acres, the Government would see all objections on that score were removed ; and, as negotiations were entered into with the Natives prior to the passing of the Native Land Act, legislative restrictions did not interfere with the purchase. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said, if his memory served him aright, negotiations were proceed- ing ; but he was not going to bind the Govern- ment in reply to a question, otherwise the hands of the Government might be forced, and they might have to pay more for the land. The honourable member was within his rights, and was, no doubt, doing what his constituents required of him in calling attention to this matter, but he (Mr. Seddon) was also within his rights when he said that this matter had not been overlooked, and that negotiations were proceeding. The Government, however, would take their own time and their own course, hoping ultimately to bring the matter to a suc- cessful issue. OLD SOLDIERS' CLAIMS. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) asked the Government, Whether they intend this session to bring in legislation to deal with outstanding claims of old soldiers ? Every session they had a crop of petitions from old soldiers, who, rightly or wrongly, thought they had been neglected. Many of them, he knew, had not been able to go before the last Commissioner appointed to inquire into these claims, owing to his visits not being sufficiently advertised. Many had been dismissed on mere technical grounds. He trusted the Government would settle these claims, and, if some of them had been thrown out on mere technical grounds, every consideration should be shown towards those who had done good and faithful service to the colony. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said a reference to the Order Paper would show that there was a fair amount of work for members to get through. He had answered this question in the negative on more than one occasion, and the honourable member would recollect that when they passed the last measure dealing with old soldiers' claims the House and the country were told it was to be final. Mr. HERRIES .- Some of them were not investigated. Mr. SEDDON said the Commissioner ap- pointed travelled from one end of the colony to the other, and his salary and expenses amounted to something like $2,000, and, as far as he (Mr. Seddon) knew, the work was Mr. O'Meara way there might have been some few cases overlooked, the better course would be for them to petition the House. As to amending the law in respect to this matter, members bad already so much work to do that he would hesitate to call upon them to deal with the question this session. # RANGIORA RAILWAY-STATION. Mr. BUDDO (Kaiapoi) asked the Minister for Railways, When he intends to authorise the erection of a new railway-station at Rangiora in place of the present antiquated and inconve- nient accommodation ? The description of this station was not his own, but was embedied in & resolution that had been passed by the Borough Council. This was one of two railway-stations in North Canterbury that had had considerable additions in regard to goods-sheds and siding accommodation during the past five-and-twenty years, but nothing had been done for the ac- commodation of passengers. At this particular station at the present time there was only office-room. There was no accommodation for shelter. It was not fair to the travelling public of North Canterbury that they should have only the accommodation at these railway-stations that was necessary when the population was not half what it was at the present time. The station-buildings were inadequate, and were at too great a distance from the main-line. He trusted to get a favourable answer. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) was very sorry to hear such a condition of affairs existed in the honourable member's district, but he regretted to say, from the report he had upon the matter, that it was considered the present passenger accommodation was sufficient, and there was nothing to warrant the erection of a new station there at present. MCLEAN'S RAILWAY-STATION. Major STEWARD (Waitaki) asked the Minis- ter for Railways, Whether he will make provi- sion for the erection of a grain-shed and improving the loading- bank and siding at McLean's Station, on the Waimate- Waihao Downs Branch Railway? A number of the settlers of Waikakahi had already approached the Minister upon this question, and he would like now to hear what the honourable gentle- man had to say upon the matter. Sir J. G. WARD ( Minister for Railways) said the traffic at this station was not sufficient to warrant the department incurring the expense that would be necessary to give effect to this request. He was informed the existing accom- modation was ample for the amount of business done at the station. The total amount of grain forwarded through this station during the last six months was 3,760 bags. MAIL-DELIVERY. Mr. HOUSTON (Bay of Islands) asked the Postmaster-General, If he will take some steps 
<page:115>
very of the Auckland mail in Wellington ? There had been frequent irregularity in the delivery of the mail from Auckland. No longer ago than last Monday the letters which arrived on that day at New Plymouth were not de- livered in Wellington till Tuesday morning, and some of them not until midday on Tues- day, and others on Tuesday evening. There must be something wrong with either the Rail- way or Postal Department. He believed it was the case that, although a steamer left Onchunga on Sunday, catching the through train on Monday morning at New Plymouth, the mails were sometimes sent by slow boat on the East He Coast, arriving here on Tuesday night. hoped the Minister would be able to see that some arrangement was made by which the mails would come to hand in proper time. Sir J. G. WARD ( Postmaster-General) said he would be very glad, and the department was only too anxious, to see every despatch in the delivery of mails, not only to members but to. every one. The circumstances at the time the honourable gentleman referred to were very exceptional, because there were two heavy mails -one Australian and one ria Brindisi-coming down on that occasion, with the result that the ordinary sorting, which took place in the train, could not be overtaken, and the officials of the department had to work through the night till the following morning. As soon as the sorting was finished the letters were sent on delivery. This was one of the few occasions when complaint had been made about the de- livery from Auckland. It was quite right to  inquire, however, and it showed the watchful- ness of honourable members ; but when they had the congestion of two heavy mails on the same day no ordinary arrangements could over- take the work. The honourable member having drawn attention to the matter, and having heard his answer, would see that the Postal Department was not more lax than in the past, and that every attention was given to insure the prompt delivery of letters. # CASUAL RAILWAY-HANDS. Mr. COLVIN (Buller) asked the Minister for Railways, If it is correct, as reported, that the number of casual hands employed on the West- port Section of the New Zealand railways is in proportion to the number of permanent em- ployés as five is to one ; and, if so, will he take steps as soon as possible to appoint to per- manent positions all those casual hands whose length of service exceeds twelve months? It had been represented to him that the number of casual hands employed on the West Coast Section of the railways was out of all proportion to the number of permanent hands, and he hoped the Minister would at once take steps to place those casual hands who had been over twelve months employed on a permanent footing. He understood that some of the casual men had longer railway service than some of those em- ploved permanently. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) said he would make inquiries into this matter. He honourable gentleman was right in what he said, because in such cases as he alluded to there must always be a large amount of inter- mittent labour, and a large number of tem- porary as against those known as permanent hands. It would not do in any administrative department of the Government to make a hard- and-fast rule as to the number of casual hands to be employed in proportion to those who were permanent, and he was quite sure no member of the House would desire to force the Ministry into any such position. On the other hand, casual hands who had been in the service a certain number of months were given the same privileges as permanent men. He would point out that converting casual into permanent hands would not, in the event of a general reduction in the number of hands, give them any more right to remain in their position than the casual hands; because throughout the colony some of the best men in the work- shops, and some of the best in the department, were casual hands, and in the event -which appeared to be in the minds of those who wished these hands to be made permanent-of reduc- tions being made, it would require to be done fairly and impartially, and quite irrespective of whether they were permanent or casual hands. The casual men would be treated throughout the colony with equal fairness, and they had the same privileges after the short time he had spoken of as the permanent men. # TELEPHONE AT KIMBELL. Major STEWARD (Waitaki) asked the Com- missioner of Telegraphs, When he will fulfil the promise made on 6th July, 1900 (see Hansard, Vol. 111, page 307), to establish a telephone bureau at Kimbell ? He would refer the honourable gentleman to the specific promise made last year in this matter. He presumed it had been overlooked. and hoped the Minister would inform him when the work would be carried out. Sir J. G. WARD (Commissioner of Tele- graphs) said he would be very happy to give effect to the promise that had been made. The department had been waiting for suitable free accommodation to enable the bureau to be established. If this could be obtained, it would be done at once. # BULL'S POST OFFICE. Mr. STEVENS (Manawatu) asked the Post- master-General, If he will place a sufficient sum of money upon the estimates this session for the purpose of erecting a new post-office building in the Township of Bull's ? The present build- ing had for a number of years been unsuitable. An application was before the Colonial Secre- tary for the purpose of having the name of Bull's changed to something more euphonious, and he hoped the Postmaster-General would see his way to place a sum of money on the estimates for a new post-office, so that it might be opened with the new name of Rangitikei or Arataumaihi. 
<page:116>
gerer. However, if the place was to have such an unpronounceable name it ought to deserve some consideration. The department believed that a new post-office was obviously required ; but until the public-works estimates were finally considered by Cabinet, he could not pledge the Government to have it built during the coming year. It was, however, on the list recommended by the department for favourable consideration. # SINGLE RAILWAY TICKETS. Mr. WILLIS (Wanganui) asked the Minister for Railways, Whether he will extend the system of single railway tickets, which are now avail- able for one day only, so that they shall be available for at least one week, as such altera- tion will be a great public convenience ? In asking this question he was anxious to know why the system of granting single tickets for one day only had so long prevailed. It was annoying to a passenger that, in the event of taking a through ticket, and finding it necessary to break his journey, he should have to take out another ticket next day. It was also trouble- some to have to take two or three tickets for one journey, and made more trouble for the de- partment. The cost of a return ticket was twice that of a single ticket, so that no loss would occur to the department if the con- cession were granted. He hoped the Minister would agree to his reasonable proposal. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) said he had indicated a few days ago that the ques- tion of single tickets was now being fully con- sidered by the Government. He recognised the great convenience it would be to people to be able to use their tickets beyond the limit    under the existing system. The reason why the change had not been made was entirely owing to the difficulty of checking : that was what had to be got over. It would require the name of every station to be printed on the sides of the tickets right through the journey. The honourable gentleman would see, if a single ticket were to be used for conveyance to-day, and a person got out at a station forty miles away, and then desired to continue his journey the following day, the department would require to have the first stop checked. Mr. WILLIS .- They are used from 4.0. one to the other in America at present. Sir J. G. WARD said there were private com- panies in America, and very great competition amongst them. They had a way of conducting their railways in America that he should be very sorry to follow here in many respects. had not been feasible under the old system to take the matter up here, but now that they had a universal system of charging for single tickets, and return tickets at double these rates, he thought the check system could be adopted ; and as soon as arrangements were matured for bringing it into operation it would be put in force, but on a more liberal scale than was indicated by the honourable member. master-General, What is the result of the " com- munications sent by him to the different portions of the Empire" (see Hansard, Vol. 113, page 313) with a view to bringing into operation a general penny-postage rate for newspapers irre- spective of weight ; and whether there is a pro- bability of this being effected, and, if so, from what date? On the 29th August, 1900, he had asked the Postmaster-General whether, in con- nection with the penny-postage system for let- ters, he would also be able to arrange that news- papers might be forwarded to Great Britain, Canada, Australia, and Cape Colony at the same rate-namely, Id. per paper. The post- age at present on weekly papers was 31d. or 4d. for each copy, and a large number of persons who would be glad to send Home papers were prevented doing so by reason of the prohibitive rates. This was one of the best means of ad- vertising the colony, and the honourable gentle- man, in 1900, in his reply, expressed his sym- pathy with the question, and said he was quite favourable to bringing into operation a penny newspaper rate within the Empire- that he was then communicating with London and other countries interested, and hoped for a favourable reply. He wished now to ascertain whether the result of his inquiries had been favourable, and if there was any prospect of this reforin being carried out. Sir J. G. WARD (Postmaster-General) said he had communicated with the different por- tions of the Empire referred to, but he was sorry to say that in each case the reply was unfavourable, and there appeared to be no im- mediate prospect of inducing the countries named to accept our newspapers at the uniform penny rate. He was exceedingly sorry for this result, but the department had done its best in the matter. They had offered to admit the 1 newspapers from those countries at the penny rate if they would agree to take our papers at the same rate; but unfortunately the Postal Union, which was a very powerful organization, ruled in the matter ; and, although represent- ations had been made to that body, the reply had been unfavourable, and they would not agree to the suggestion. He would, however, keep on representing the matter, and hoped finally to succeed. # RIVERS COMMISSION. Mr. R. MCKENZIE (Motneka) asked the Minister of Mines, When does he intend to lay the report of the Rivers Commission before this House ? This Commission had sent in its It report some time back, and some members who were considerably interested in the matter were anxious to hear what the report was. He hoped the House would get it very soon. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Mines) said that the final report of the Rivers Commission was now in the hands of the Printer, and would be brought down and laid on the table as soon as it was ready. 
<page:117>
Government, If it is their intention to grant three days' leave of absence to the whole of the Police Force on account of the Royal visit, or only to those who followed the visitors over the colony ; and, if to the latter, why not to those members of the Police Force who left their homes to attend at the large centres during the stay of the Royal party ? He had put this question in view of a communication he had received from a constituent, who was not a policeman, and who thought it a great hard- ship to some of the police that they had not been allowed the same concession as the police who actually followed the Royal visitors through the colony. He hoped the Minister would give him an explicit answer on the question. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Justice) said he was glad to be able to inform the honourable gentleman that not only those members of the Police Force who left their homes, but those who had done extra duty in connection with the Royal visit, would receive the consideration which was mentioned in the question, the order being to grant three days' extra leave to all members of the Force who were called upon to perform extra duty during the Royal visit. # LAKE ELLESMERE. Mr. RHODES (Ellesmere) asked the Minister for Railways, If he has yet come to any de- cision with regard to the request for a grant in aid of the permanent drainage. works proposed to be constructed at the outlet to Lake Elles- mere? Shortly, the position with regard to the proposed drainage- works was that the Minister of Lands had promised £1,000 towards this work on condition that the Minister for Railways would give $700. He was not sure that the Minister for Railways had not already consented to this effect, and had so informed the Selwyn County Council. If so, he would not proceed further with the question. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) said the Selwyn County Council had been advised that the payment of a sum not exceeding $700 towards the construction of an outfall, provid- ing the cost of the outfall alone amounted to $4,000, with a proportionate reduction in the event of the cost of outfall being less than $4,000, had been approved by the Government, on condition that the Railway Department in- curred no liability for the future maintenance of the outfall; and arrangements were being made accordingly. SLY-GROG SELLING AT PORT ALBERT. Mr. MONK (Waitemata) asked the Minister of Justice, Whether he is aware of the particulars of two cases of sly-grog selling brought before Mr. Bush, S.M., and Mr. Hutchison, S.M., respectively, at Port Albert on the 25th August, 1893, and the 15th May last, and the con- tradictory decisions arrived at therein ; if so, what remedy will the Minister suggest for what seems a serious irregularity ? This question arose out of two cases heard at Port Albert. and the Stipendiary Magistrate, Mr. Bush, ruled that it should have been brought against the steward, who was practically the guilty person. Subsequently a similar case was brought before Mr. Hutchison, Stipendiary Magistrate : but it was held that the charge could not lie because the police had made the charge against the steward instead of the captain. The Minister would at once see that two such contrary decisions rendered futile the efforts of the police, who did not know what to do ; and it seemed to him that in the interests of justice such un- certainty should be put at rest by a definite decision being obtained from a competent authority. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Justice) said the case had not been brought before him until he had noticed it in the honourable member's question. He was now instituting inquiries into the matter in order to ascertain the posi- tion, and when that information was obtained it was possible some action would be taken. # COAL COMMISSION. Mr. R. MCKENZIE (Motueka) asked the Minister of Mines, When does he intend to lay the report, minutes of proceedings, and evidence of the Coal Commission before this House. He would be glad to hear that it was the intention of the Government to print this evidence, as it was of considerable importance, and especially in regard to the occurrence of a fire in the Cardiff coal-mine, which the Commission was sent down to report on. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Mines) said he was very pleased to be able to answer in the affirmative. The only delay in the bringing- down of the report was in connection with the accumulation of work in the Printing Office. As soon as that was overcome the report and evidence of this Commission would be laid on the table of the House. # AWAMOKO STREAM. Major STEWARD (Waitaki) asked the Minis- ter of Mines, Whether it is intended to proclaim the Awamoko Stream as a sludge-channel in accordance with the petition of Maerewhenua miners to that effect ? Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Mines) said this was a very important question. The position regarding this stream was that there were some forty-five claimants, and their claims amounted to over $66,459. Besides this, there were ob- jections from the Waitaki County Council, the dairy-factory proprietors, the farmers, and the Land for Settlements Department. Under these circumstances it was not intended to proclaim the Awamoko Stream a sludge-channel. SUPREME COURT JUDGES' SALARIES. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) asked the Minister of Justice, If the Government intend this session to afford the House an opportunity of increasing the salaries of Judges of the 
<page:118>
the Empire. The same might be said of the Act so as to enable advances to be made to salaries paid to the District Court Judges, who settlers, merchants, and manufacturers on ap- were paid a salary which was about one-third proved shipments of New Zealand produce ? of that which was paid to the County Court He would like to point out that the system Judges of Great Britain ; and it was very much referred to was in force in South Australia, and less than was paid to the County Court Judges it had worked very satisfactorily there, and had in New South Wales, Victoria, and the other been the means of giving a great impetus to States of Australia.

In regard to the District Court Judges, he might say that matter was under the consideration of the Government. vernment, Whether they will introduce legis- lation to allow local bodies to make their own DUTY ON GLASS-MAKING MACHINERY. valuations for local rating purposes ?

<page:119>
Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston) asked the Govern- ment, Whether it is not possible for the Valua- tion Department to complete the local bodies' valuations so that they can have the rolls by the 1st April in each year? He would like to point out that in the case of the Palmerston Borough the Government valuation was not ready till the 1st July, with the result that the rate could not be struck before, and it was estimated that up to the beginning of August there was a loss in interest, through the fault of the Government, of £0. It was unfair that a local body should be muleted in a loss like that. When the Act was passing through the House he suggested that the Government valuations should be made in January to enable the rolls to be prepared and the Assessment Court to deliver its decisions, so that everything would be ready for the local bodies by the end of March. If that were done there would not be the same amount of friction that there now was under the present system. He would specially draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that, while the Government charged heavily for its valuations, there was nothing done to facilitate the work of the local bodies. The local body ought to be able to strike a rate in May, but at .present they could not do so until July, which resulted in a very unfair impost being made on the local bodies. Mr. MILLS (Minister in charge of the Go- vernment Advances to Settlers Office) said that under "The Government Valuation of Land Act Amendment Act, 1900," section 29, (2), the  following provision was made : That local authorities should levy their rates in accord- ance with the district valuation-roll as cor- rected up to the 31st March next preceding the levy. That being so, it was impossible to let any local body have their rolls by the 1st April. After the valuations had been made or amended the rolls had to be prepared by the office in Wellington and notices sent to the local bodies. The work of the Assessment Court had also to be undertaken, and this work all took up time. The local bodies were asked to say when they would levy the rate, and, as a matter of fact, every effort was made by the department to forward the rolls in sufficient time to enable the rates to be levied without delay or inconvenience. In reply to what the honourable gentleman said about dissatisfaction arising from the valuations, he would read to the House what instructions were sent out by the department. There seemed to be some misunderstanding spread abroad as to what they contained, and if the memorandum was read it would disabuse the minds of those who were of opinion that undue influence was used by the Valuer-General with the object of having the valuations raised to a value beyond what they ought to be. Mr. PIRANI said he never suggested any- thing of that sort. Mr. MILLS said it had been suggested at different times in the House, and it was as well to let honourable members know the position to every District Valuer :-- "From information received by the depart- ment it seems apparent that in some parts of the colony land is selling just now at very high prices, and the difficult question which the department has to solve is as to whether these high prices are likely to continue, or whether they are due only to causes which will not be lasting in their effect. " Without wishing in any way to influence District Valuers in their judgment as to values, I think it may not be out of place to caution them against valuing lands at their current market-value in places where there is any like- lihood that the ruling prices may not continue. I have heard of land selling at :$26 and £28 per acre for dairying purposes which a year or two ago was not valued at half that price. "I think in such cases it will be advisable not to be guided too closely by sale prices. In cases where districts require revision it is better, in my opinion, to raise the values by a gradual process, always endeavouring to keep within the selling-prices. It should be borne in mind that the department does not desire ex- cessive values, and in cases where prices realised are considered by public opinion to be excessive we should not adopt these prices as an unalter- able basis. I prefer that values should be low rather than that they should be in any way ex- cessive." Honourable members would therefore seo that fair and reasonable instructions were given to District Valuers before the valuations were made. Ho was aware himself that the Valuer - General was doing his best to get a bed-rock value for the whole of the colony. Of course, with the many large districts to value, it was a matter that would take some time. Mr. TANNER (Avon) asked, What about the scandalous charges made by the department- most iniquitous ? Mr. MILLS said it was easy for the honour- able member for Avon to use those strong terms, but it was not so easy for him to justify them. Mr. TANNER said he was simply deluged with correspondence with respect to the exces- sive charges. Mr. MILLS said he had also had correspon- dence on the subject from the honourable mem- ber's district, and if the honourable gentleman would put a question on the Order Paper he (Mr. Mills) would tell him all about whether the charges were iniquitous or not. Mr. TANNER said he knew they were. They were three times what they formerly amounted to. Mr. MILLS said no doubt the honourable gentleman only knew what had been told or written to him; but in some cases the local bodies might not have informed the honourable member that they were receiving a certain amount back again for the rolls they issued to other local Boards. Mr. TANNER said the honourable gentleman was speaking of the Sydenham case. He knew what the honourable gentleman meant ; but he (Mr. Tanner) was not referring to Sydenham. 
<page:120>
Mr. MILLS said, exactly so. He was glad | the honourable member admitted one Board had not made a full statement of facts. The matter had been thoroughly investigated, and since a reply had been sent to that Board he had not heard any objection from them. How- ever, he would be pleased to refer again to the real facts of the case. If the honourable gentle- man would put a question on the Order Paper, or if the honourable gentleman would submit the correspondence in his possession to him, he would look into it, and if an injustice had been done he would see what he could do to remedy it. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston) asked if it would not be possible to alter the date of the valua- tions so that they could be completed carlier in the year than they were at present. He did not say that under the Act anything better could be done at present, but he thought there should be an amendment. Mr. MILLS said if representations were made on the matter by some of the local bodies, and they were very numerous, he would bring the matter before Cabinet, and let the Government decide whether the alteration the honourable member suggested should be made. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton) said he would like to be allowed to read a letter bearing on the matter, which he had just received from the clerk of a Road Board in his district. The letter was as follows : --- "That this Board complains principally as to revision. In most cases the Board has to ad. vise the department of alterations required, and  is then charged for permission to make such alterations. The amount paid by this Board for revision in the past year is $9 14s., which would have cost the Board nil if allowed to do it themselves. The department of their own knowledge know nothing of alterations in ten- Consequently, Road Board clerks Pave ancies. to supply information, for which the 4.30. department charges the Board." Mr. MILLS .- Did you mention who that was from ? Mr. G. W. RUSSELL would give the honour- able gentleman the letter. Mr. TANNER would give the honourable gentleman another letter -- half a dozen if he liked. Mr. MILLS said he knew there had been circular letters sent to different members. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL said this was not a circular. Mr. MILLS, at any rate, had seen circular letters that had been sent to different members on the same subject. They gave the same de- tails in each letter, but they had only referred to one case. He might tell the House that he did not know of one single complaint now be- The complaints made by fore the department. some persons who falt aggrieved had been dealt with, and so far those who had been written to had not sent word to him that they objected to his explanation. STONE-CRUSHING MACHINERY. Mr. BUDDO (Kaiapoi) asked the Minister of Customs, If he will favourably consider the ques- tion of the remission of Customs duty on stone- crushing machinery imported by local bodies, and which cannot be manufactured in the colony ? This was a very important matter to all local bodies throughout the colony which had anything to do with the care of roads. Now, it became a question whether it was politic on the part of the State to take such a large sum out of the pockets of these local bodies in the form of Customs duties on machinery that could not be made in the colony. The stone-crushers re- ferred to in the question were charged a duty of $48 10s., and it was an extraordinary charge on a necessity to good roads. Labour could not be obtained in the colony to crack stones, and he  was very pleased indeed that it could not ; and  they could not keep their roads in good condi- tion with a covering of shingle, and unless the department remitted this impost it would no doubt lead to their roads not being maintained in that degree of efficiency which was essential for the well-being of our settlers throughout the colony. He hoped the Minister would state, in his reply, that he would be prepared to remit the charge made by his department on these stone-crushers. Mr. MILLS (Commissioner of Trade and Customs) might state, in reply to the honour- able momber, that it was impossible for him to do anything beyond carrying out the law. The law at present stated explicitly that there must be a duty of 20 per cent. charged, and there- fore he had no option at all. He quite agreed with the honourable gentleman that the day had arrived when the local bodies must en- \- deavour to keep in the van of progress, and endeavour to make their roads good, so far as they possibly could with the rates and fees at their disposal. He would take the opportunity of submitting this matter to the Cabinet, and he would acquaint the honourable gentleman afterwards what the decision might be in re- gard to a remission. It could only be done by placing a sum on the estimates to be voted by the House. There were some few other local bodies which had imported similar machines, and had paid these amounts; and therefore it opened up a broader question than that of deal- ing with only the one importation by one local body. Personally, he agreed with the remarks of the honourable gentleman. As far as local bodies were concerned, he knew from personal experience they had a lot of work to do and very little means with which to do it. COLLINGWOOD-FERNTOWN BRIDGE. Mr. R. MCKENZIE (Motucka) asked the Minister for Public Works, What progress, if any, has been made by his department with the construction of the Collingwood-Ferntown Bridge ? Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister for Public Works) said it was necessary before plans were prepared to survey the site. This had taken some time. The plans were now complete, and the specifications were almost complete, and tenders would be invited in the course of a week or two. 1 
<page:121>
Mr. BUDDO (Kaiapoi) asked the Government, If they will submit the proposed scale of teachers' salaries, and allowances to Education Boards for building and maintenance, to the Education Boards for consideration before giving effect to the recommendations? The Education Boards of the colony were naturally very anxious to know what would be their posi- tion after the amount had been agreed to in regard to teachers' salaries, and he thought perhaps it would be wisdom on the part of the department if they would submit to the Educa- tion Boards for their consideration the proposed scale of teachers' salaries, and also the allow- ances for building and maintenance. Building and maintenance was now the principal busi- ness of Education Boards, and he thought it was necessary they should be consulted before a decision was arrived at, to afford the Boards an opportunity of expressing their views on the matter. Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) said a Commission had been set up to deal with this matter, and representatives of Education Boards, of the school teachers, and Inspectors were appointed to that Commission. He believed the report of the Commission would be such as would satisfy the members of the House. He was afraid that if members of the Education Boards were now again called upon to express their opinions, before a decision were arrived at, it would lead to such delay that no colonial scale of salaries would be adopted this Parliament. However, after the report had been circulated among the Education Boards they could make what representations they pleased. But he, for one, would not delay   the legislation that might be thought necessary merely for the purpose of obtaining the assent of all the Education Boards, or the majority of the Education Boards, to the proposals con- tained in the report. He thought the House had confidence in the gentlemen who composed the Royal Commission. When they had the report of that Commission before them they would know better what was the position, and be believed members would be justified in taking upon themselves any responsibility in carrying out the recommendations of the Commission. Mr. BUDDO asked, What about the allow- ances to Education Boards for building and maintenance. Mr. HALL-JONES said that would be gauged from the amount required towards cost of the teachers' salaries. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL asked when the report of the Commission would be circulated. He understood it was handed in yesterday. Mr. HALL-JONES believed it was now in the hands of the Governor. and as soon as it was returned it would be laid before the House, printed, and then circulated as speedily as pos- sible. SUBSIDISING PUBLIC LIBRARIES. Mr. LANG (Waikato) asked the Government, If it is their intention to continue to assist pub- this session for the purpose of subsidising the public libraries throughout the colony in the same manner as they have done during pre- vious sessions ? He hoped the Minister would reply to this question that the Government not only intended to continue the subsidy, but that they would increase it to the amount at which it formerly stood. He might remind the Minis- ter that in 1883 and 1884 the sum paid by way of subsidy to the various libraries was €6,000 for each of those years. Considering the large amount of good the subsidy had done in the way of encouraging these public libraries, more particularly the small libraries in country districts, he hoped the Minister would see his way to say the Government would increase the subsidy to the former amount of $6,000. Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) was very sorry that he was not able to give the honourable member the satisfactory answer that he desired- namely, that the vote for this purpose this year would be equal to $6,000. He thought if the House voted an amount equal to that of last year- $3,000 -he (Mr. Hall-Jones) for one would be satisfied. The local people must remember that it was a matter of duty with them to assist these libraries, and that the subsidy of $3,000 frem the Government was a very reasonable con- tribution. RAILWAY TO ALEXANDRA. Mr. BENNET (Tuapeka) asked the Minister for Public Works, If an alternative survey of the railway from Chatto Creek, via Spring Vale terraces, to Alexandra can be made, with the view to obviate the necessity of crossing by means of three costly bridges over the Manor- burn and Manuherikia Rivers and the conse- quent delay during construction? He asked this question at the request of a number of his constituents, who were under the impression that if a deviation of this route were found practicable it would save the cost of three ex- pensive bridges, and there would also be a con- siderable saving in the cost of construction, and likewise in the time required for construction. Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) was obtaining additional information with regard to the portion of the route of the Otago Central Railway referred to by the honourable member. He was down there two years ago with the District Engineer, and to an outsider it appeared to be a more direct route ; but, although it might be a more direct route, the cost of construction alongside the river by the steep face of the cliff would be much in excess of the first survey that bad been made. However, he intended to make further inquiry into the matter, but he did not think it would be a better route than that which had been surveyed. An engineer would be starting in a few days to test the matter. KAWAKAWA-WHANGAMOMONA RAIL- WAY. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) asked the Go- vernment, If they will this session take the -

The authority for the construction of the line between Stratford given to this country up to the session of 1900 members of the House had enjoyed the privilege and Kawakawa had only been given for that and, indeed, the unquestioned right of having re- portion up as far as Whangamomona.

During the present session he (Mr. Meredith) had sent a note to accepted by the Government, and the House were unanimous in approving of the determina- the Government Printer-not being aware that tion of the Government to construct this line that embargo continued in force-asking him to simultaneously with the North Island Main reprint a few copies of his speech upon a certain Trunk line.

The initial step was, of in a constituency would be able to gain any course, the authorisation of the line, and he information of what actually transpired on the hoped the Minister would see his way to have floor of that House. He represented a country electorate extending from north to south about this done during the present session. Mr. HALL- JONES (Minister for Public two hundred miles, and from east to west about Works) said the authorisation of the line would eighty miles, and his constituents were scat- tered in small communities. If, therefore, he be of no use unless they had a vote of the House had not the right to reprint copies of his to enable the Government to carry out the work. Now, the honourable member had speeches many of his constituents would have pointed out that in the Ohura Valley there no opportunity of knowing what their repre- were only a few settlers, and it would be far sentative was doing in the House.

He intended to press this from the Stratford end, where every acre of question until the restriction was removed. land had been taken up for some fifty miles Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public along the route, and consequently there would Works) said the honourable gentleman ought be an immediate return upon the money ex- to know that this so-called " privilege " of re- pended.

these had been from the honourable member, one was from a colleague of his (Mr. Hall- Jones), and one was from the Opposition benches. He had acted strictly in accordance with the legal opinion on the matter. He did not know whether Mr. Speaker would be pre- pared to act as censor, and to say whether or not certain speeches should be reprinted at the Government Printing Office and cir- culated. Personally, he would not take that position. It was the duty of the House to protect the Government Printer from any action that might be taken. Let the honourable member move in that direction. They had more work in the Printing Office this session than they had had for years past. Many of the reports were delayed owing to the work of the Education Commission coming in late ; and then to ask that they should take up the time of the Office-apart from the legal liability -in printing reports of members' speeches when they could get them done nearly as cheaply in an outside office was undesirable. He was not aware it was a right any honourable gentle- man could demand -it was a matter of courtesy ; and he would have been only too pleased to continue it if it had not been for the warning he had received last session. He considered he was doing his duty as the administrator of the When department in acting as he had done. the question had been referred to recently he had pointed out that a member's speech containing libellous matter printed separately might be held to be libellous, but that if an ordinary number of Hansard were circulated with the Government imprint it was privileged, and he had stated that he was prepared to issue the single number of Hansard at almost the same price as the single speech. That was a fair offer, and if the honourable gentleman wanted to circulate his speeches all he had to do, after he had made one of his eloquent addresses, was to notify the Government Printer that he wanted ten thousand copies of the number, and he would have them printed, and the honourable gentleman would be supplied with them at a cost not much in excess of that of the single speech. He failed, however, to see why liability should be thrown on the tax- payers of the colony, or why they should be called upon to defend any libel action, or why the Government Printer should be called on to do so, in order to satisfy the vanity of any member of the House. Mr. MEREDITH said the honourable gentle- man was drawing a red-herring across the scent. Could he state any instance of a libel action being brought against the Government Printer for a reprint of members' speeches ? In the second place, he might be permitted to say. in reply to the honourable gentleman, that whenever he had a reprint of his speeches he had always paid to the full the account rendered by the Government Printer. He was under no obligation to the Government Printer ; and, notwithstanding the honourable Printing Office. Mr. HALL-JONES said he did not for a moment doubt that the honourable gentleman had always paid for the printing of his speeches ; and in regard to any action for libel being brought against the Government Printer, he did not know of any ; but he did know of the lia- bility of that officer if what the honourable gentleman desired was to be given effect to, and it was his duty to protect him, and it was the duty of the House to protect him. It was open to any honourable member to get the whole number of Hansard, or to give the work to an outside printing-office at an extra cost of 30s. more per ten thousand copies of his speech. KIOURANGI POINT LIGHTHOUSE. Mr. R. MCKENZIE (Motucka) asked the Minister of Marine, What progress, if any, is being made with the construction of the Kiou- rangi Point Lighthouse ? Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister for Public Works) said very good progress was being made. The lamp and apparatus had been ordered, and was expected to reach the colony in November. Then, a contract had been let for the iron tower, also to be completed in November ; and the plans and specification of the other build- ings were now ready. # TADMOR BRIDGE. Mr. R. MCKENZIE (Motueka) asked the Go- vernment, If they will make provision on this year's estimates for the railway-bridge over the Motueka River at Tadmor being also made a road-traffic bridge. Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister for Public Works) hoped to make provision for the work referred to. The plans and specification were complete, and ready for inviting tenders. WAIMATE HIGH SCHOOL CADET CORPS. Major STEWARD (Waitaki) asked the Go- vernment, Why so long a delay-namely, eighteen months-has occurred in connection with the offer of the services of a cadet corps in connection with the Waimate District High School, and when the school authorities will be informed of the decision arrived at? He asked the question in consequence of having received the following letter from the head- master of the Waimate District High School :- "Waimate, 14th July, 1901. " DEAR SIR, -- I am in receipt of your letter of the 5th, for which many thanks. " In reply, I may say that the Government have not vet accepted the corps to be formed in connection with our school. The position is simply this : Fully eighteen months ago both High School Board and School Com- mittee resolved that a cadet corps be formed in connection with the Waimate District High School. The former body voted $30 towards uniforms, and the School Committee agreed to find the balance. All the necessary details were gone through-number of boys eligible, 
<page:124>
whether anything had been done-only to find that the application had not been for- warded. Either Colonel Gordon or Bailey was in fault here. All the preliminaries were again gone through; but again we got no satisfactory reply from the department. " Again application was made, and this time we were told that cadet corps were now under the control of the Education Department. I then applied to the Education Department, but they said they had not completed arrangements. Again I applied, with the same result. "If you can do anything for us we shall be very grateful .-- Yours, &c., " GEORGE PITCAITHLY. "Hon. Major Steward, M. H.R." It seemed to him, after the discussions in the House, and the unanimous opinion of members that cadet corps should be en- couraged, that it was extraordinary that eighteen months should have been allowed to elapse when a suitable corps was offered without any answer being vouchsafed, although repeated applications had been made to the de- partment. Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister for Public Works) said he thought the honourable gentle- man did not mean that there had been no answer, but that no decision had been come to. He believed there had been correspondence be- tween the authorities of the school and the de- partment ; but that no decision had been come to was quite correct. The reason for this was because the authorities asked for something of  an unusual character. Honourable members were aware that, in connection with cadet corps, where they were formed at high schools they came under the Defence Department, and re- ceived $20 per annum ; but where they be- longed to ordinary primary schools they received no such grant, but they got a supply of model rifles. The difficulty in connection with this school was that it was a district high school, and therefore in a similar position to a primary school. If it had been a high school they would have had a grant in the ordinary way, or if they formed a cadet corps on the lines of a primary school they could get the rifles ; but they, being mainly a primary school, wanted to bring themselves under the same rule as the ordinary high school, and that was where the difficulty occurred. The best course would be for them to form a cadet corps as if they were a primary school. Major STEWARD asked if the Minister would have a communication sent to the school authorities to that effect. Mr. HALL-JONES said he would request his colleague to have that done. CO-OPERATIVE WORKERS. Mr. LETHBRIDGE (Rangitikei) asked the Minister for Public Works, If he will explain why the co-operative workers on the North Island Main Trunk Railway are continually com- plaining of the Engineers' measurements ? He Major Steward to the measurements. They complained that, after having finished the work and having obtained competent persons to measure their work, it was found to be nearly twice as much as the measurements of the Engineer. He was not speaking without information, because he had a letter which he had received from a party of men at Taihape, and the writer said,- " I wish you to place this letter before the House, and show clearly the way in which the co-operative works are being run up here, and how the labourers are being victimised on the works here. My case is as follows : Myself and party shifted 760 yards at Is. a yard, and on pay-day they wanted to pay us off with 370 yards, which I refused to take. It's been mea- sured by three different parties, all competent men, and they all make it 760 vards. This fetched us out at the rate of 6s. a day. I can- not get any redress here, so I hope you will do your utmost to show the way in which the co- operative works are being run here, and expose the present 'sweating' system, which prevails from one end of the line to the other. There are married men here who can't get enough money to shift them out of the district, and would be happy if they could once get away. 'Sweating' is quite general here, and we are all of opinion that the Government is responsible for the lot. Will some of those men who are so fond of the working-man at election stand to us now, and make this a test case, and cause an inquiry into the administration or maladminis- tration of the work. Things are in a terrible state here, and it is about. time something was done for the men. We have got no union, no Arbitration Court .-- I remain, &c., AND PARTY. "P.S .- Please put this letter on the table ; it is all solid facts. When I write a letter like this I confine myself wholly and solely to facts. By doing this you will do the co-operative men in this district a favour which will be appre- ciated by one and all." Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) presumed the honourable gentleman would follow the usual course of laying on the table of the House a document read in debate. seeing that this was a matter of importance. He would like to ask the honourable gentle- man if he realised his responsibility in this matter, seeing that he was making a charge against the Engineer at the works that he was robbing these men of one-half their earnings. As regards the charges, he knew nothing about them. There was sometimes a difference of opinion amongst the men as to the absolute quantity of material they had shifted; but what possible interest was it to the Engineer to defraud the men of a single penny ? Some- times they were told that these works were costing too much, and the honourable gentle- man said they were "sweating" the men. The honourable gentleman should, before bringing such a serious charge against Mr. Cook, who was the Engineer in charge of these works. 
<page:125>
the Main Trunk Railway, two complaints had been made during the last month, and in the case of one gang of men their measurements were found to be rather fully correct, and the men earned 7s. 8d. a day. The other complaint was made by a gang of men who were incom- petent, and who perhaps had actually worked harder than the other gang. What he meant was that they were not accustomed to the class of work to be done. The honourable member would know what he meant. An incompetent man might work hard and yet earn less money than another man who was more competent than he was, simply because he was accustomed to that kind of work, and therefore could get through more work. There was, apparently, a feeling in the mind of the honourable member for Rangitikei that these men were in some way defrauded of their earnings ; but he might say that of all the cases which he had investigated during the past four or five years he had never known one brought against the Engineer that had been proved ; and, if the honourable member for Rangitikei was prepared to take to an outside tribunal the question of whether or not these men had been defrauded of one single penny of their earnings, he would be quite willing on his part to agree to that course. So far as he knew, no injustice had occurred in connection with works of that kind ; but the lazy man, or the indifferent man, did not carn as much as he wished to. or thought he ought to earn. Hence the complaints of the rate of pay. When, however, that was the case  it was a serious matter for a member of Parlia- ment. knowing the position he held, to make such statements in the Parliament of the colony concerning an officer in the public service, who, he was sure, had no wish to defraud, and cer- tainly no intention of defrauding, the men of a halfpenny. Mr. LETHBRIDGE, as a matter of personal explanation, said that he made no charge against the Engineer in charge of the works. He had stated that these complaints came fre- quently to him, and he only asked an explana- tion from the Minister in charge as to why the complaints were made. Mr. HALL - JONES said the honourable member must not forget that a member of Parliament, when he made a statement there, made it with all the authority of a member of that House, and members who had heard what the honouralle gentleman had stated could judge whether or not he had made a charge against the Engineer. WELLINGTON CUSTOMHOUSE. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) asked the Government, Whether they will this session place a sum on the estimates for the erection of a Customhouse on the site specially re- claimed for that purpose in the City of Wel- lington ? It was essential, in order to remove the inconvenience resulting from the congestion in the Post-Office building, that the erection of with the reclamation which was being carried on by the Wellington Harbour Board, the Govern- ment, of course, paving the cost of the re- clamation of the site concerned. The Secre- tary of the Harbour Board thought that the reclamation would be sufficiently far advanced for the purpose of erecting the Customhouse by the end of August or the middle of Sep- tember, and that would enable the Government to proceed with the erection of the building so soon as they were ready with the necessary funds for the purpose. It would enlighten and satisfy the mercantile and shipping community of Wellington if the Minister would say that before the end of the session the Government would place a sum on the estimates to begin the erection of the new building. Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister for Public Works) said, Yes ; he realised that this was an urgent work, and that the accommodation was much required for the Customs and other departments, and the Postal authorities re- quired all the accommodation in the Post- Office building for their own purposes ; and he hoped that when the estimates were brought down a sum sufficient to meet requirements in this respect to the end of the financial year would be voted. When the building was erected they might then hope it would be sufficient to meet not only the requirements of the Customs Department, but of the Inspector of Machinery branch, the Weather Reporting Office, and an office for the Superintendent of Mercan- tile Marine for shipping matters. These should all be provided for in the new building. # RIVER-BEDS. Major STEWARD ( Waitaki) asked the Minis- ter of Lands, Whether his attention has been called to the necessity for preserving to the public the right of road over and along river- beds; and whether he will take measures to effect this, either by vesting river-beds in the local governing bodies as reserves for public use, or in some other way preventing the public being deprived of their privileges? The origin of the question was this: Complaints had reached him from his district that a gentleman wishing to travel in the usual course along a certain river-bed, along which there had been a right of road for very many years, found himself stopped by a settler, who claimed to have the sole right to the use of that river-bed. It appeared that a lease of the grazing-rights had been granted by the Land Board, but that it was quite understood by the Board in granting the lease that all the privileges of the publie were to be preserved. Well, the lessce had evidently found he was in the wrong, be- cause the Land Board, he understood, had called in the lease with a view to making it quite clear that the rights of the public were to be protected. Now, no doubt this particular grievance had been, or would be, remedied, but the circumstances raised the general question as to whether there ought not to be some pro- 
<page:126>
any steps in order to preserve to the public the ter of Lands, Whether he has received a petition right of road along all river-beds, and whether he would do this either by vesting the river-beds in local bodies, or in some other way protecting the public privileges. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) said that the public had no right of road at all along many river-beds in the colony. In the early days lands were often sold with a river as the boundary, and this by law gave the owners the title to the land up to the middle of the stream, together with riparian rights. The law for the last ten years had been that the Crown should, in disposing of land, reserve from sale a chain wide on the margin of the sea-shore, on the margin of all lakes exceeding fifty acres in area, and on the banks of all rivers exceeding 33 ft. wide : see section 110, " Land Act, 1892." These strips of land were usually shown on the record maps as roads, and, where this was so, they were by virtue of sections 100 and 106 of "The Public Works Act, 1894," "public roads " under the control of the local body ; and, as section 121 of that Act prohibited any road on a river bank being closed, the rights of the public were sufficiently protected. But, as this arrangement only covered what had been done for the last ten or twelve years, he thought it was time the question was considered now whether it would not be right to in some way give the public the right to the bulk of the rivers in this colony, because he held that it never should have been parted with ; and when it was known that a wrong  had been done to the public he thought it ought to be righted. However, he had not lost sight of the matter. He remembered bringing it up when he was a private member of the House, that hardships had occurred to some people at that time; but when a matter of this kind was gone into he found it was very difficult to handle. But he would inquire into it, and see whether it would not be wise to take some steps to recover the right to all or nearly all of the rivers in which trout had been liberated in this colony, so that anglers should have the right to go along them for recreation and sport. Major STEWARD would like to ask the honourable gentleman when making these in- quiries to look into a decision given-so he was informed by the honourable member for Auck- land City (Mr. Napier) -- by the Appeal Court in the case of the Crown versus the Ralph Taupiri Coal-mine. It appeared that the Appeal Court had only recently decided that the law was not that the owners of the land owned to the centre of the river, but that the Crown owned the river in every case. The Hon. the Minister might look up that point. Mr. DUNCAN said that applied to the river so far as the water covered it, but we wanted the right alongside the river. He was aware that the Crown had a right to the river itself ; but where the Crown had parted with the front- age up to the river we had no right to it out- side the flood-mark. Major Steward from the Redcliff and Takitu districts praying that the benefit of the 10-per-cent. rebate on prompt payment of rent may be extended to holders of leases of small grazing-runs ; and whether he proposes to amend the law so as to enable this to be done ? Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) said it was not contemplated to give the small grazing- run holders this privilege, as some of them only paid 2} per cent. Their case was altogether different from the settlers under the Land for Settlements Act, or even ordinary Crown lands,  and the leases were generally short. # MR. A. H. CHAPMAN. Major STEWARD (Waitaki) asked the Minister for Agriculture, What is the nature of the agreement or understanding, if any, between the Government and Mr. A. H. Chap- man, of Kurow, who has proceeded to the Old Country to exploit a certain invention or process for the thawing of frozen meat, and whether the Government has undertaken to defray the cost of his passage to and fro ? Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) said there was no agreement or understanding whatever between Mr. Chapman and the Government to give that gentleman anything, either for expenses or salary. # OSTRICH-FARMING. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) asked the Minister of Lands, Whether in his next Land Act Amend- ment Bill he will make provision for the en- couragement of ostrich-farming ? Probably the Minister of Lands would remember that he asked a similar question to this last session, and the Minister then expressed himself to the effect that the idea was a good one, and pro- mised to make inquiries during the recess. During the recess the Minister had availed him- self of an opportunity of visiting the Whitford Park Ostrich-farm, in the electorate of Franklin, and he was sure the honourable gentleman was duly impressed with the possibilities of the ostrich-farming industry. He was sure the Minister would come to the conclusion that such an industry was worthy of encouragement under the land-laws of the colony. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) might state that the Land Bill which he intended to bring in last year, and which he had now in preparation with some additions, would provide that the Government might enter into a special agreement with people for this purpose, the encouragement of ostrich-farms. The measure would, he expected, be submitted to the House in a few days. MARUIA HOT SPRINGS. Mr. COLVIN (Buller) asked the Minister of Lands, If he will get an expert report on-(1) The medicinal properties of the hot springs, Maruia district ; (2) the area of agricultural and pastoral land available for settlement in 
<page:127>
that this was a matter of very great importance to the people on the West Coast, and he under- stood from experts who had visited these hot springs that the medicinal and curative pro- perties were equal to any of the kind in the colony, and perhaps in the world. The Go- vernment had made no attempt to try and utilise them ; and if these baths were opened up it would be a great boon to a number of miners who suffered on the West Coast from rheumatism and other such complaints. The springs were within a very short distance of Reefton ; about seven hours by a good road would take a person from Reefton to the springs, and Reefton was connected by rail- way with nearly all parts of the West Coast. He hoped and trusted the Government would see their way to open up these springs, and if a road was made there were forty to sixty thousand acres of good agricultural and pas- toral land available in that district. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) said, -(1.) Reports had been obtained from time to time upon the medicinal properties of the hot springs in the Maruia district, and another could be obtained if it was desired. (2.) The Crown lands in the Maruia Valley had been reserved partly for public utility in connection with the springs, and partly for mining. The other Crown lands adjacent were covered with forest, and not likely to be taken up for agricul- ture or pasture. The area within the watershed could, however, be taken. (3.) No detailed survey had been made, but inquiries had been instituted, and it appeared that there would be about twenty- seven miles of road to construct, costing about $14,680. This would not include the cost of bridges over the Inangahua and Otto Rivers, which would, perhaps, not be required at first, but would cost a large sum. He held, with the honourable gentleman, that the question re- quired to be looked into, and if it was found the valley was as fertile as it was stated to be, and available for settlement, it would be right to have a road. The right of the people to get to the springs was a matter of much import- ance to the district the honourable gentleman belonged to, and £14,000) would, no doubt, make a good road. The matter was worth inquiring into, so that they might see what should be done in the near future. NINE-MILE PUNT, BULLER RIVER. Mr. COLVIN (Buller) asked the Minister of Lands, If he will accede to the request of the petitioners who applied to him to have the charges reduced at Nine-mile Punt, Buller River, to the same amount as those charged for the Landing Punt plying on the Inangahua River ? Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) said the only petition recently received on this subject was dated the 16th July, and it did not ask that the charges be made the same as those at the Landing Punt, but it asked for a reduction. A promise had, however, been made to Mr. Colvin mise accordingly. INANGAHUA RIVER BRIDGE. Mr. COLVIN (Buller) asked the Minister of Lands, If it is his intention to call for tenders for the bridge over the Inangahua River, known as the "Landing," at an early date? This was a bridge on the main road between Nelson, Reefton, and Westport. There was a punt on it now, and at times the traffic was stopped through floods in the river. The Premier was stopped on two occasions himself when trying to get to his constituency from Nelson. He hoped the honourable gentleman would see his way to put this necessary work in hand at an carly date, as it was of great importance to the travelling public and to the residents in Ina- ngahua Valley. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) said ten- ders would be called for this work as soon as the necessary plans could be completed. There was a vote of $500 on the estimates, but the work would probably cost about $2,500. VETERINARY SURGERY. Mr. HOGG (Masterton) asked the Govern- ment, Whether they propose to give facilities for instruction classes in veterinary surgery within the colony, so that an opportunity may be afforded the youth of New Zealand of filling positions that are now at great cost and loss of time conferred on experts from distant parts of the world ? He would like the Minister to give him a favourable reply to this question. His own opinion was that the colony ought to be able to provide its own veterinary surgeons. There were settlers' sons growing up - good, capable, young men - some of whom were receiving an excellent education in the colleges and universities of the colony. These youths should have an opportunity of fitting themselves for the positions he referred to. He had had applications from parents who wished their sons to qualify as veterinary surgeons, but no provision for their instruction existed. The Government had lately brought out from Home a number of these surgeons. He thought it would be well if facilities were afforded for the instruction of our boys in this particular branch within the colony. Instead of bringing men from abroad, some of whom would only remain until they found a better position elsewhere, our own people, who were identified with the colony, should be selected for vacancies of the kind. There were diseases affecting stock that were peculiar to New Zealand, and there were also peculiarities incidental to our native pro- ducts and climate that render it advisable that we should have experts trained on our own soil, if possible. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) said that this was a matter to which he had given somo attention, especially since the Act had come into force. Under that Act a number of experts were required to carry out the provisions of the \- Health Act, and on making inquiry he found 
<page:128>
be expected, with the training they received in the colony, to pass an examination equal to that of the Old Country and the diploma of a veterinary surgeon. A special institution would need to be established to enable a higher class of education to be given. He had talked the matter over with Mr. Gilruth, the Chief Veterinary Surgeon, who had lately returned from the Home - country, and it was that gentleman's opinion that it would be quite within the power of the colony to teach young men sufficient to fill the role of an ordinary veterinary surgeon in the colony at little cost. The matter would be put in hand as soon as practicable. DEHCRNING OF CATTLE. Mr. HORNSBY (Wairarapa) asked the Go- vernment, If they will this session deal by way of legislation with the matter of the dehorning of cattle, especially taking into consideration the fact that it has now been demonstrated that the dehorning process can be carried out without cruelty if calves only are dealt with ? He would like to say to the Minister that in the district he represented, Mr. Reynolds, of Taratahi Plain, had for a number of years carried on experi- ments in this direction, and at present he had nothing on his estate but hornless cattle. The process, according to Mr. Reynolds, was a simple one, and that gentleman had brought it before the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, in the hope of getting it adopted throughout the colony. The method was to deal only with the calves when they were a few months old. If they were taken in hand then the horn would never develop, and the method was one that had the merit of being painless. Of course, there would have to be a means of dealing with the already horned cattle ; but, at any rate, if there was the knowledge spread abroad that in the future there need be no pain inflicted on cattle, the method, he thought, would be taken advantage of. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) said it was not intended in the present session to take any steps in this particular matter. OREPUKI-WAIAU-LONGWOOD ROAD. Mr. GILFEDDER (Wallace) asked the Minister of Lands, If he will place a vote on the estimates this session for the improvement of the road leading from the Orepuki-Waiau Road to Block: XVI .. Longwood ? Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) said the matter was now under consideration. WOOL CLASSING AND GRADING. Mr. GILFEDDER (Wallace) asked the Minis- ter of Lands, lf the Government will favourably consider the desirability of appointing an expert to give lessons in wool classing and grading, so as to enable the wool-growers of the colony to place this commodity on the home market to better advantage, and so secure the highest Mr. Duncan wool to better advantage than they had been doing in the past, and so obtain higher prices for this important product. The wool-export industry was a considerable one, and was of immense benefit to the country, but he had heard from those who were expert in the matter that the highest prices were not ob- tained for the wool that was exported simply because it was not properly classified. If the Government would appoint an expert to give instruction in classifying wool he was sure that, as expert instruction had tended to improve the dairving industry, which had brought into the colony a great amount of wealth through the better prices that had been realised, a great boon would be conferred on the colony, and the wool-growers would be immensely benefited. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) said this was a very large order, and one that was rather difficult to deal with. They knew that in shear- ing-time the place that required most attention was the back blocks. Often two or 5.30. three men would shear first one owners' sheep and then another, and join in this way, so that these were men that really required the most of our consideration in the way of assist- ing them to get the wool up in the best form. But it would be very expensive, and for some time he thought it would be difficult indeed to meet them. At the present time there was no scarcity of experts in wool-classing. Any one who had a reasonable number of sheep and could afford to engage such a man could get him at very ordinary wages, and a first-class man too. But he thought what the honour- able gentleman wished was that they should have some man to go through the country to educate those who are not able to get these experts. They had that under consideration, but, as he had stated, it was a very difficult thing to meet at present ; but, still, it was under consideration, and they might be able to do something later on. IMPORTATION OF BONES AND BONE- DUST. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) asked the Minister for Agriculture, If he will remove the existing restrictions on the importation of bones and bonedust, and arrange for the steaming, under departmental supervision, of imported bones at private factories at Auckland and other places ? Mr. DUNCAN (Minister for Agriculture) said they had to go very carefully in dealing with this matter. He was sorry to say that anthrax had broken out again. It was sup- posed that it had been introduced through getting bones that had not been properly steamed. It generally arose from that cause. It might not be so in this case-he did not know that it had - but, at any rate, they had to be very careful, because a great many of these bones were collected from paddocks containing the remains of beasts that had died from some 
<page:129>
made into manure on the premises, but it was those that were collected by people going round the country which were exported here and brought in these diseases with them. Of course, they would have to get these bones in some form or it would be a bad thing for the country. They should have some suitable body to look after the matter in some central place, and having strict supervision over it. That was the only way he could see of dealing with it. He intended to bring this matter before the Stock Department and see if they could not devise some means of coping with it. Mr. MASSEY asked, Would the honourable gentleman refer it to the Stock Committee ? Mr. DUNCAN said, Yes. SETTLERS' FIRE INSURANCE BILL. Mr. HOGG (Masterton) .- This, Sir, 7.30. is a very short and, I think, if it is passed into law, it will be found a very useful little measure. It is intended to enable the Advances to Settlers Office to perform the work of insuring the risks that it has against fire. The clauses in the Bill provide :- " The Superintendent is hereby authorised to accept any risk by way of insurance against tire on all buildings or on any security already mortgaged. or on any security that may here- after be mortgaged, to the Superintendent. " Every mortgagor shall on the expiry of cur- rent fire insurance policies, or, where no such policies exist, insure against fire with the Superintendent of all insurable buildings on the security mortgaged to him." Then. the Advances to Settlers Board is en- abled from time to time to determine the rate per cent. to be paid by way of premium by the insurers. Provision is made that in the case of existing mortgages the Superintendent shall on the expiry of the current policies determine the amount of insurance risk to be effected : and, in the case of new mortgages, from and after the passing of the Bill the Board shall determine the insurance risk to be effected. The moneys thus obtained from the settlers are to be placed to the credit of an Insurance Fund Account. The amounts paid in and the dis- bursements from that fund will be kept apart from other transactions, so that it will be impossible for any complication to arise with reference to the method of account keeping. Clause 9 provides : -- " If the balance in the Insurance Fund Account is at any time insufficient to meet the charges thereon, the Colonial Treasurer may from time to time advance such sums out of the Consolidated Fund as may be necessary to meet the deficiency." An Hon. MEMBER .- Suppose he does not ? Mr. HOGG. - Well, I do not suppose the colony is likely to become bankrupt. If an insurance company is prepared to perform operations of this kind, I should imagine that the Colonial Treasurer would be equally able to meet any losses that might be incurred. But what are the facts? Since this office has been ! cedure ; but, notwithstanding this encroach- VOL. CXVII .- 8. per annum is being made by the insurance offices in clear profit out of the borrowers. That is to say, the amount paid to the insur- ance offices exceeds every year by $500 or $600 the amount that is paid on account of fires. Now, I hope that those who have the interests of the settlers at heart, especially the Crown tenants who are receiving assistance from the Advances to Settlers Office, will not require to be persuaded that it would be a most beneficial thing if that money could be placed at their disposal in order to assist them in carrying out their improvements. We know that many Crown tenants do a large business with the Advances to Settlers Office, and they have a very hard struggle at the pre- sent time. If, therefore, a sum of $500 or ₺600) per annum could be saved to these men it would be of great advantage to them. In New Zealand it is a common thing for large property- owners to avoid insuring their properties at all. In some of our boroughs owners of. buildings who have a considerable amount of property rented to tenants, instead of contributing to the insurance offices, undertake their own risk and avoid insuring, because they reckon it will pay them better in the end than if they paid the heavy premiums which the insurance companies exact. The Government itself avoids insuring its properties for the same reason. The same thing occurs in connection with the Educa- tion Boards. They prefer to run the risk of an occasional fire, such as occurred in this city a few months ago when one of the schools was burned down, than pay the heavy premiums the insurance offices demand. Viewed from every standpoint, it must be evident to mem- bers that the mortgagee, who is in this instance the Superintendent of the Advances to Settlers Office, should undertake what are virtually his own risks. The machinery he already has at his disposal is ample, I think, to provide for all purposes. . The new duty would entail very little extra trouble. All he will require to do is to collect the insurance rates at the same time as he collects interest on the money advanced. Seeing that this proposal is not likely to impose any risk or burden upon the country, that the office with its present staff is able to carry out the operations required, and that the result must be a great and increasing advantage to the settlers who are dealing with the Advances to Settlers Office, honourable members, if I am not mistaken, will be disposed to assist me in getting this Bill passed into law. Mr. R. THOMPSON (Marsden). - Mr. Speaker, I wish to draw your attention to clauses 8 and 9 of the Bill. I think they are appropriation clauses, and should be introduced by message from the Governor. Mr. SPEAKER .- It does appear to me that there are appropriation clauses in the Bill, not only 8.and 9, but also clause 3, which authorises the use of the office of the Government Ad- vances to Settlers without the consent of the Government being signified to such a pro 
<page:130>
the attention of the Chairman of Committees to the monetary features of the Bill, and he, no doubt, will not submit such clauses to the vote unless in the interval between the second reading and the committal of the Bill the consent of the Crown is signified to the ex- penditure of public funds contemplated by | due consideration. certain clauses of the Bill. An Hon. MEMBER .- I would draw your atten- tion to clause 9. Mr. SPEAKER .- I think an earlier clause, No. 3, involves the expenditure of public money. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) .- After your announcement, Sir, I doubt whether the honourable member will care to go on with the Bill. I believe he has a laudable object in view, but as the objection has been raised that it is an appropriation Bill, and you, Sir, have stated that certain clauses will have to be introduced by Governor's message and by a Minister, it would be better if the honourable member got a Minister to father it. It seems, also, to me i before the House and country, I have achieved, that the honourable gentleman would be wiser | I think, a very useful object. I am very pleased if he were to put in a permissive clause. As | to hear the Minister in charge of the Advances the Bill is at present it appears that the Super- ! to Settlers Department state that the question intendent might charge a higher rate than the insurance companies do at present, and the settlers would be compelled to insure. Surely that is not what the honourable gentleman means, as it would be increasing instead of de- it, but I think that the expression of opinion creasing the present premiums. There should ! given by some members - such as the member be, I think, a proviso that the rates should not . for the Bay of Plenty, who has spoken very be higher than those at present in vogue in the i favourably regarding it, and has suggested  district. If the Bill is introduced in proper form, and with the proviso I suggest, I should have much pleasure in supporting it, as I be- ! farmer and understands thoroughly what the lieve that it would benefit a desirable class of settlers. Mr. MCLACHLAN (Ashburton) .- I am very pleased the honourable gentleman has brought in this Bill. I have seen the want of it for a long time. Land Boards frequently make ad- vances for workmen's homes up to $50, which must be insured in the name of the King ; but the expenses of inspecting such risks are greatly multiplied owing to the fact that the insuring company has to inspect the risk. If the Govern- ment were to insure their own advances, all this would be avoided, and there would be no risk, because these people can only insure for half value ; the risk therefore would be almost infinitesimal. Whether it is an appropriation or not, the principle is a good one, and I hope the honourable member will proceed as far as he can and force the hand of the Govern- ment. Mr. GUINNESS (Grey). - I should like to ask the Minister in charge of the Advances to Settlers Department whether the Government is going to give their assent to the appropriation clauses or bring down a Governor's message recom- mending them ; if not, it is wasting time to discuss the Bill. Mr. MILLS (Minister of Trade and Cus- toms) .- I was not in the Chamber when the ever, that the Government have a State Fire Mr. Speaker that it is a Bill which contains provisions which can only be introduced by Governor's message and by a Minister of the Crown. I would suggest that the honourable member should withdraw the Bill for the present. The matter embodied in his measure will receive Mr. GRAHAM .- We cannot hear a single word you say. Mr. MILLS. I have told the House plainly that the Government cannot consent to this Bill proceeding any further, as it contains appropriation clauses. It must be brought down by Governor's message, and be introduced by a Minister of the Crown. Mr. GUINNESS (Grev) .- I beg to move the adjournment of the debate. Mr. HOGG (Masterton) .- I would like to say that when I introduced this Bill I anticipated that there might be one or two formidable hurdles to be jumped, but by having it printed and circulated, and bringing it prominently ; raised by this Bill will receive the consideration of the Cabinet. As this is an appropriation Bill, I presume I am unable, without Minis- 1 i terial permission, to proceed much further with amendments of a reasonable character. and also the member for Ashburton, who is a practical requirements of the settlers are-is so emphatic that the Bill will not be allowed to drop. The Government, I hope, will see their way to take charge of it and pass it into law. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL ( Riccarton) .- I merely wish to say that I think it is rather an extra- ordinary position that the Minister in charge of the Advances to Settlers Department should sav at this stage that the Bill will receive the consideration of Cabinet. This Bill has been on the Order Paper for some time, and I cer- tainly think that it is not treating the House fairly that at this stage the Government should . say that they will take into consideration an important matter of this kind, when the pro- ! posal is before the House for its second reading. Mr. HALL . JONES Minister for Public Works) .- It is the general practice that a nem- ber in charge of a Bill containing appropriation clauses brings the matter before the notice of Ministers, and asks their consent to these clauses being put in the Bill ; and then they have to be introduced by Governor's message, after having received that assent. I am not aware if in this instance there has been an oversight, or whether the honourable gentleman is not aware of the practice, but I am sure we all appreciate the laudable object he has in view. Seeing, how- 
<page:131>
be that measure. However, the Minister in charge of the department has promised to con- sider the question, and when we bring on the State Fire Insurance Bill no doubt this ques- tion of our settlers will be dealt with. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) .- I think that, with regard to the last point raised by the Minister for Public Works, if the State Fire Insurance Bill becomes law and goes on the statute-book it will supersede this one and make this un- necessary ; but, with regard to the appropriation clauses, I think it is a very great pity that the honourable member in charge of the Bill did not consult the Executive before wasting the time of the House. From the "Decisions of the Speakers " it is quite clear that the Govern- ment alone can initiate measures for the appro- priation of public funds. Abstract resolutions that money be devoted to a particular purpose can be passed, but when not supported by the Executive Government are futile. That is exactly the position with regard to this Bill : it requires an appropriation. If not supported by the Executive Government, the Bill, though it may go through all its stages, will be abso- lutely useless. Mr. MILLS (Minister for Trade and Cus- toms) .- I would like to say, by way of personal explanation, that the honourable member for Riccarton knows as well as any other honour- able member in this House the usual and proper mode of procedure in these cases. Of course, if the honourable gentleman who introduced  the measure had consulted me I would have informed him at once as to the position. But the matter evidently escaped his memory and escaped mine.   Mr. MEREDITH (Ashley). - Sir, I think the House should be guided by your decision, and go on with the second reading. It would have provoked a very animated and interesting de- bate. I do not agree with the honourable mem- ber for the Grey in moving the adjournment of the debate. If the honourable member in charge of the Bill will press the second reading of the Bill I will support him in doing so. I intended to have spoken on the second reading, but the honourable member for Grey has taken the ground from under my feet and from under the feet of honourable members. I notice the Government have introduced a Bill which has the same intention as this Bill, but which is rather more general in its application, and I think it would be of great advantage to the Government if this question had been thoroughly ventilated this evening. I regret the position of my honourable friend the member for Mas- i nity of the centres of population are concerned. terton. He and I have been brothers-in-arms ' I will illustrate what I mean. Christchurch in this House for very many years, and in | City electorate is four miles by two miles and a bringing forward a measure so liberal and so | half, and has a rural population, according to much to the point I would have supported | the reports of the Boundary Commissioners, of him. Mr. COLLINS (Christchurch City) .- Sir, I cannot understand the line of the honourable gentleman who has just sa down. He appears : bo. Dunedin is seven miles by four miles, desirous of having debate simply for debating and in this city electorate there is a rural have done nothing but talk, and the honourable member has delivered more speeches than any other honourable member. It.is quite true we all delight in the honourable gentleman's elo- quence, and he, no doubt, throws a flood of light on every question he discusses ; but if we are to discuss a Bill let us discuss a Bill with some practical issue, and it has been clearly shown that there can be no practical issue so far as this Bill is concerned. Debate adjourned. REPRESENTATION BILL. Mr. ELL (Christchurch City). - Sir, the honourable member for Caversham and the honourable member for Avon have applauded me on rising. I am glad to see they meet the proposal I make with such kindly feeling. I can assure members that it is not with any desire to injure any member in any way that I introduce this Bill. I think both these honour- able gentlemen know me very well, and know I strongly believe in representation according to the population, so far as we can reasonably put the principle in operation. Now, it will be remembered that last session I brought in a proposal with the object of reducing the concession to country districts from 28 But I found per cent. to 15 per cent. this : that after collecting a good deal more information than I then had when I gave notice of it, I found that there was more in the arguments which had been adduced in favour of granting a 28-per-cent. concession than I had at the time realised. But, Sir, I would remind honourable members that at the time the concession was first granted- prior to 1887-it was with the object of assisting those districts in a fair representation where the population was very scattered. In 18-7 it it was reduced to 18 per cent. Then, in 1889 a Bill was proposed to make it 25 per cent., but it was extended to 28 per cent. The late Mr. Ballance then expressed the opinion that the objection to the 18 per cent. arose from the strong feeling in the mind of the country mem- bers that, on account of the scattered popula- tion in their electorates, they were entitled to some concession. Well, we will grant that much ; but it must be conceded that while a 28-per-cent. concession shall be granted to an electorate that is perhaps forty miles by sixty miles, or eighty miles by a hundred miles, or thirty miles by forty miles, the argument does I not hold good so far as the centres of popula- tion and the electorates in the immediate vici 260, so that the Commissioners are entitled to add a nominal addition of 28 per cent. to the rural population, wherever it may 
<page:132>
and in another the rural population, also the total actual and the total with the nominal ad- dition added. Auckland is three miles and three-quarters by two miles and five-eights, and has a rural population of 216. Caversham is four miles by one mile and a half and has a rural population of 1,996. Mr. MORRISON .- Where do you get these figures? Mr. ELL .- I am simply taking the figures from the official map issued by the Boundary Commissioners. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- What is the defini- tion of " ru: al population " ? Mr. ELL .-- The honourable gentleman knows St. Albans, in the Christchurch electorate. He knows that in a part of St. Albans there are dairy farmers-that is counted rural - and to the population contained in that rural area 28 per cent. may be added. In Invercargill there is a rural population of 5,125, and the Com- missioners are entitled to add 28 per cent. to that number. Now, the Invercargill 8.0. electorate is five miles and three- quarters by five miles and a quarter, and the adjoining electorate, Awarua, is ninety - six miles by forty-three miles. One can under- stand the reasonableness of adding 28 per cent. in a case like that, where the population is spread over a vast area. I contend that . when the law was passed in 1889 it was never contemplated by the Legislature that 28 per cent. should be added to the rural popu- lation contained in the Invercargill electorate.  Lyttelton is eight miles by five miles, and my honourable friend the member for that district is, I know, a sound democrat, and believes with me that we should have repre- sentation according to population. That should be the basis upon which we should have repre- sentation in this House, so far as we can get it. As I have already stated, a good deal of reason can be given in behalf of granting con- cessions to rural populations in scattered dis- triets. Riccarton is ten miles by ten miles. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- It is far bigger than that. Mr. ELL. - I submitted my maps to a draught man in the Lands Department, and they were sealed, and this is the rough esti. mate of the length and breadth. Mr. RUSSELL. - It is very rough. My dis- triet is about eighteen miles long. Mr. ELL .-- As to Napier. it is seven miles by four miles and a half, and I do not think honourable members can contend that it is reasonable to grant concessions to a rural popu- lation in such a small area as that. Honour- able members will see in the Bill that the only electorates placed in the schedule to which I am contending that the 28 per cent. concession shall not be given are Christchurch, Dunedin, Wellington, Auckland, Caversham, Napier, Lyttelton, Avon, Riccarton, Parnell, Timaru, and Invercargill. If the 28 per cent. conces- sion is taken away it will not unduly extend Mr. Ell in this Chamber should be according to popula- tion. I will not dwell any longer upon this. I think I have explained it pretty clearly to honourable members. I have also pointed out. that the original intention was that the 28-per- cent. concession should be granted only to those districts in which population is very scattered, and which had a very great area in their boundaries. I move the second reading of the Bill. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) .- It is not very often that I second a motion proposed by the honourable member, who is generally too far advanced for me ; but on this occasion I have much pleasure in doing so, for the reason that I think if the principle of the Bill were carried into law it would be beneficial for the country districts. As he has informed you. it was never intended that city electorates should get the 28 per cent. increase given them for the benefit of the country portion of the districts : but, as he has pointed out so clearly, they do get it under the present law. And how do they get it? It is in this way: the boundaries of the electorates are not always coterminous with the boundaries of the boroughs, and the Act of 1889 says that the 28 per cent. shall be added to all population outside any borough or town district of over two thousand inhabitants. But the city electorates, or the electorates called city electorates, very often have boundaries beyond the boundaries of the borough, and so include a population which is not within a borough containing two thousand inhabitants, and therefore that population, though in- cluded in a city electorate, is still entitled to have the 28 per cent. added to it. Now, I do not think any honourable member will contend that that was what was intended by the Legis- lature when it passed that Act. Mr. FISHER .- Is that actually so ? Mr. HERRIES. - Yes ; there is no doubt about it. Mr. FISHER. - It is not so in Wellington. Mr. HERRIES. . Then, if it is not so in Wellington, the honourable gentleman need not oppose the Bill, because it will not affect Wellington ; but it is correct so far as the other boroughs mentioned in the schedule are con- cerned. I do not say that the schedule is por- fect, I do not know enough about the figures : but certainly, so far as the city electorates are concerned, thev ought not to be allowed any portion to which the 28 per cent. is added. Though agreeing with the principle the honour- able member has enunciated -- which I think a very proper one-I doubt whether this Bill will give effect to what he proposes. He must know that before next Parliament sits the boundaries will all be altered, and the electorates in the schedule will be altered, and it is quite possible that when the new boundaries are given, even if this Bill passed, some population subject to the 28 per cent. increase may be included in the electorates mentioned. The consequence is that he will have to pass a new Bill with 
<page:133>
the very names of the electorates will not be kept up with the redistribution of seats. I should much prefer that he should carry out his design in this way-namely, by saying that the population, say, within a quarter of a mile of a borough or town district, or something like that, shall not have the 28 per cent. added to it. I think he should do that rather than leave the Bill as it stands, to apply only to particular electorates, which are fleeting objects, here to- We do not know day and gone to-morrow. that even their names will be retained next time. I do not think the Bill would attain the object desired, but the principle I am quite in accord with. I know cases in which the 28 per cent. has been added to and included even in the city electorates, and I think most honour- able members will agree with me that that was not what was intended, but that it was intended, in dealing with the country districts, that 25 per cent. should be added to the country and not to the urban districts, as is the fact now. I have much pleasure in seconding the measure, because I approve of the principle contained in the Bill as being beneficial to the country districts. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) .- Sir, I re- member that the discussion on the Representa- tion Bill which led to the fixing of the 28 per cent. concession to the country districts was the occasion of one of the most memorable " stone- walls " that ever took place in this House. And it was my pleasure on that occasion to be in complete agreement with my modest young  friend Mr. W. P. Reeves. The "stonewall " la-ted for three weeks, and was most earnestly, most honourably, and most patriotically kept up by the city members fighting steadily and   steadfastly against the encroachment of the country members. We were beaten in the end : but then, after all, we adopted the view that it was only just that the sparsely popu- lated country districts should have the 28 per cent. added to their quota, and I do not see any reason, distant as the time now is from the passing of that Act, for altering the decision come to by the Legislature on that occasion. The Boundary Commissioners will sit at no distant date to arrange the boundaries of the electorates of the colony, and it may well be left to them to decide what the future bound- aries should be. I take the proportion of the suburban population which goes to augment . the city constituencies to be, if not infinitesi- mally small, at least to be so small as not to demand any very serious attention. While the honourable member for the Bay of Plenty was speaking I asked him whether the Bill would affect the City of Wellington, and the honour- able member for Christchurch (Mr. Ell), who introduced this Bill, said that it did not affect the City of Wellington. I was not in the House during the delivery of the early part of the speech of the honourable gentleman, but during the last portion, which I did hear, the honour- able gentleman made no reference to the popu- lation of the city electorates, or to that portion that extent the argument of the honourable gentleman was, to my mind, defective. If the population of the cities has so increased that there is an overflow to the districts surround- ing the cities, which is especially the case in the City of Wellington, it is fair to assume that in our case, by reason of the increase in our population, we shall have one additional mem- ber. Mr. MONK .-- You have too many already in the cities. Mr. FISHER .- We have too many already ? Well, they are the best men in this House anyway. As to the Auckland members, there is room for very great improvement. Well, Sir, one cannot help admiring the industry of the member for Christchurch City, Mr. Ell. One cannot possibly entertain any feeling of hostility towards him. One sees his evident carnestness in every matter he brings before this House. Though not yet fully matured in opinion, it is no less the duty of the young as well as the old members to add to the power and the wisdom of Parliament. The honour- able gentleman is perfectly entitled to put forward his views of the question, but if the imperfection in the representation of the country amounts to such dimensions as he would have us believe, then it demands not only the attention of the Legislature, but of the Government, whose duty it will be to bring in a Bill to remove the imperfection. But at the present moment the duty of attend- ing to this disproportion of the electorates, and especially of dealing with the 28-per-cent. ac- cretion in the country districts, is a matter, I take it, that will be left to the consideration and decision of the Boundary Commissioners. Mr. ELL. - There was an increase by a nominal addition to the rural population in the City of Dunedin Electoral District. .Mr. FISHER .- Yes, of course; and a very good thing too. But it does not matter what is the increase in the population of Dunedin, or Wellington, or Christchurch, or Auckland. It will be the duty of the Commissioners to allocate the seats in this House according to population, and to alter the boundaries of the several electoral districts. It is for that particular duty they were constituted by Act of this Legislature. The Legislature itself did that ; and, as I have said, although I opposed it at the time, I opposed it solely in the interest of the city electorates. I opposed it at the time-being loyal to the representatives of the large centres of the colony with whom I voted as one of the City party-yet now, reflecting upon what has passed in recent years, I am bound to admit that the country districts are entitled to the concession then given to them. Sir, I do not want to see in this House a resumption of that feud between the country and the city members. It should be remem- bered that we are here as representatives of the interests of the colony as a whole, and not as the representatives of particular districts. That is the view every member of this House ought 
<page:134>
able gentleman says, his Bill is not aimed against the country districts then it follows that it must be aimed at the cities. An Hon. MEMBER. - It is not against either. Mr. FISHER. - It is not against either ! Then, why this Bill? I rather imagine, and I hope the honourable gentleman will believe that I say it without the least offence, that the honourable gentleman has not studied the sub- ject very deeply. Far be it from me to say one word which would wound the honourable gentleman's feelings. I give him credit for a sincere desire to bring about an improvement of the law; but I do not see that by passing this Bill the law would be improved in the least degree. And as a logical sequence I oppose the Bill. But I hope the honourable gentleman will not interpret that expression of opinion as an act of hostility. I simply say that his proposed amendment of the Act is quite unnecessary. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton) .- I am rather afraid that the remark that was made by the member for Wellington Ci y (Mr Fisher) just now, that the member for Christchurch City has not sufficiently studied the question that is before the House has something of truth in it. The proposal of the honourable gentle- man is that section 2 of " The Representation Act Amendment Act, 1889," is hereby amended by adding to subsection (2) thereof the follow- ing proviso : "Provided that such addition shall not be made in any portion of any of the electo- rates named in the schedule hereto." Now, what is the subsection of the Representation Act which it is proposed to amend. Subsection (2) says, - " In computing for the purposes of this Act the population of the colony, there shall be added twenty-eight per centum to the popula- tion not contained in any city, borough, or town district which contains a population of over two thousand." There is no reference in the subsection which the honourable gentleman is going to amend to the electorates at all. The position, of course, is that under the Act of 1899 the Commissioners are required to ascertain the total population of the colony. Then, to that portion of the popu- lation of the colony which is outside any city, borough, or town district containing a popula- tion of over two thousand, they add 28 per cent. That gives the gross total - with the 28 per cent. added to the rural population-of the entire colony for representation purposes. It is that gross population that is obtained by adding on the 28 per cent. to the rural population which they have to divide by the number of seats in order to get the quota. It therefore appears quite evident, from the section of the Bill which the honourable gentleman proposes to amend, that it has no reference whatever to the electo- rute, and, therefore, to tack on a proviso to the Act of 1889 is quite unnecessary and useless, and indicates that the honourable gentleman has not sufficiently studied the subject. Now, what is the position, so far as the Commis- Mr. Fisher the colony by adding 28 per cent. to the rural population of the whole of New Zealand, as I have stated. They have, first of all, then, to i select the city electorates. It is laid down that . there shall be three members, and that the city electorates shall be three times the quota. It is only when you come to the latter part of subsection (5) of clause 2 of the Act of 1889 that you begin to find out how the duties and re- sponsibilities of the Commissioners regarding country electorates are limited. But the chief point is that they are, in seeking to make elec- torates that have community of interest, and so on, allowed a working margin of 750. But it is laid down that the Commissioners may not apply that rule of the allowance of 750 in the i case of city electorates, and there are other provisions further down the clause that apply to : what I may call country districts alone so far as the allowance of 750 is concerned. But the honourable member, in bringing in this Bill, proposes to apply it only to certain suburban constituencies. Now, under our law there is no such thing as the selection of certain con- stituencies. The honourable member in this Bill mentions, for instance, Caversham. Why there might be no such electorate as Caversham after the next sitting of the Boundary Commis- sioners. It might be called the electorate of Mornington, Roslyn, or some other name. Mr. ELL .- Look at subsection (5) of clause 2 of the Act of 1889. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- That clause men- tions the four city electorates, it is true, but the honourable member is making a mere play upon words to say that a special constituency should be selected. It is quite impossible that there shall be constituencies in this colony that should not take their names from the four great centres of population : but it is altogether out of the question when you go away from the four large centres and seek to include the sur- rounding districts. Take the Avon Electoral District, one of those mentioned in the schedule. Why, the changes in connection with the elec- torate at the last fixing of the electoral boundaries were enormous. Then. take the alterations made in connection with the Ric- carton electorate. Why, the honourable mem- ber knows as well as I do that prior to the election before last the Riccarton Electoral District included the whole of the Belfast dis- trict, and went out as far as Chaney's corner ; and that now, instead of going out in that direction it has been pushed by the Boundaries Commission to West Melton, a distance of six- teen or eighteen miles from the City of . hrist- church. I sav, if you are going in a Bill to select the names of certain constituencies, and to say that in those particular constituen- cies certain things should be applied. you must bind down the Boundary Commissioners. Make it a condition of their appointment, in fact -that they shall always continue in existence constitu- encies of those names, whether thev happen to be necessary or desirable or not ; and vou might have this position, that the law would not apply 
<page:135>
tion of our representation. Now, why is this extra 28 per cent. given to the country districts ? I will tell the honourable gentleman. In the first place, everybody knows that in the large cities and boroughs public opinion is more acute. The people are able to walk a few hun- dred vards and record their votes. In those cities there are the large political organizations of the colony, which are able to make them- selves felt more or less as the election comes on. There are the large metropolitan newspapers, which are able to influence public opinion very much more than they can in the country dis- tricts. Those are the reasons why a handicap has been placed upon the cities by which the country districts have an extra 28 per cent. given to them. But as I have already shown, it is not given in particular electorates, and therefore this Bill has no application. First, you ascer- tain the total rural population of the colony, and then the gross total is obtained by adding 28 per cent. I sympathise with the remarks of the honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) as to the sincerity of the honour able gentleman who has introduced this Bill, but I venture to say this proposal to take away the 28 per cent. which is given to the country districts, emanates from a small coterie in the City of Christchurch, and one which does not usually take a broad view of the large considera- tions involved in many matters of legislation. That being the case, although I do not desire to move that the Bill be read a second time this  day six months, I shall certainly feel it my duty to record my vote against the proposal now before the House. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- Sir, on a question of such grave importance as this I should be wanting in my duty did I not express the views I hold in regard to this matter. I do not believe in attacking-because this appears to be an attack-the quota that is given to the country districts. I do not see why the suburban populations should be deprived of the 28 per cent. That is what the honouralle gentle- man is proposing, I believe. By what argument can that be sustained? I say there are large country districts that are a hundred miles long, and there are suburban electorates where the surroundings are the same, and the conditions are the same, and I do not see why this attempt should be made in respect to the suburban dis- tricts. If, Sir, the main issue is to be raised -the issue of town versus country, and the taking away of the 28 per cent. from the quota -- then I can understand it. If this is the thin end of the wedge, and it is to be applied to the suburban populations with a view of ultimately taking it into the country districts, then I can understand that there is some force in the position taken up by the honourable gentle man. Take, for instance, the district of the Wellington Suburbs. Surely those people fol lowing, as they are, farming and agricultural pursuits, should not be treated differently from those following the same occupations further Otaki. The member for Otaki represents part of the Lower Hutt, and at the same time he represents all along the coast. But this is a suburban district, and probably would come under this Bill. Then, I say you are injuring the farmers of Otaki and right along the coast by taking away their privilege of 28 per cent. Why should this be the case? There may be some little centres or suburban electorates that are probably equal to Christchurch, and might be dealt with in the same way. But there are others again where, to get the necessary quota, you have to go far afield in the country districts; and those country representatives, if the Bill became law, would have the privilege they now en- joy taken away. I think strong cause should be made out before we make this alteration, and I believe it is sound in principle that if we are going to do anything with the represen- tation or electoral law or system it should not be done piecemeal or by a Bill like this, singling out certain electorates, and not interfering with others. I believe that is the proper course to adopt on the main question of urban, suburban, and country representation. I may say at once I shall not be a party to taking from the country representation the quota they enjoy. Mr. J. W. THOMSON (Clutha) .- Even with the advantage of the 28 per cent. the country electoral districts are very large. In the dis- trict I represent there are nearly forty small centres, and any one who contests an election has to address the electors at nearly that num- ber of places. There are districts even larger, territorially, than the district I represent, and in these districts there is a very scattered population. Mr. ELL .- I am not touching country dis- tricts at all. Mr. J. W. THOMSON .- I do not know what the honourable gentleman means if he is not touching the large country districts. That is not in accordance with his speech. In the large towns a candidate may not have to address more than three or four meetings; but in & country electorate he has often to speak at about forty different places, and this is rather too much for any man. I have always opposed legislation of this kind, and intend doing so on this occasion. Mr. ELL .- The honourable member for Ric- carton stated that I did not understand what I was talking about. If the honourable gentle- man will take the trouble to look at the elec- toral maps, which he must accept as official, and examine the tables in connection with them, he will see that in connection with Christchurch the Commissioners state there is a rural population of about two hundred and sixty in the Christchurch electorate. He will see that there are no less than 1,445 of rural popu- lation in the City of Dunedin, according to the Commissioners, and that in a town like Inver- 
<page:136>
will see that when I stated that there was a rural population in the city elec- torates, and that there was a nominal addi- tion to be added to that, I was only stating what was correct. Now, take Parnell, which is a very thickly populated district. According to the Commissioners there are 6,545 in the rural portion of the electorate of Parnell, and yet Parnell is only three miles by a mile and a half, and if you take the nominal population and the actual population according to the Commis- sioners, there is a nominal addition of 1,100 over the 750 the Commissioners are allowed ; so it will be seen that there is a nominal addi- tion of 1,100 to the actual population of Parnell. That, I think, disposes of the honourable mem- ber's contention that I did not understand what I was talking about. With regard to the conten- tion of the Premier, that there was no logie in my argument, when I listened to the honourable gentleman I was wondering where the honour- able gentleman's logic came in. He was one of those who in connection with the alterations in the law of 1889 pleaded on behalf of the scat- tered population in the country districts, and on account of the difficulty of people getting to the polling-booth, and he urged that there should be some principle in operation that would keep these electorates within more rea- sonable bounds. He pleaded and worked very hard for the 28 per cent. concession, and for the reason I have stated -because they were large areas, and the population very scattered. I agree that there was some reason for granting  the concession to a scattered population in elec- torates of very large areas. But I contend that it was never contemplated by the Legislature that there should be any rural population in the City of Dunedin electorate-that there should be a nominal addition of 28 per cent. to 1,445 of a rural population in the City of Dunedin- and in arguing for this alteration of our law I am simply asking that the law should be carried out in the spirit in which it was passed by the Legislature-that this concession of 28 per cent. should not be made to apply to the centres of population, or to the thickly populated districts in the immediate neigh- bourhood of centres. With regard to the remarks of the honourable member for Clutha, that honourable gentleman seemed to be under the impression that I was seeking to rob the big country districts. Why, Sir, the concession of the 28 per cent. which I am proposing shall be withdrawn from the city and suburban elec- torates will help the big districts. It will mean that the district of Lyttelton will spread out into the district of Ellesmere, which measures fifteen miles by forty miles, while the electorate of Avon will have to spread out in the direction of Kaiapoi, and the electorate of Riccarton will spread out in the direction of Ashburton. Now, that is all I contend for, that the law should be carried out according to the original intention of the Legislature. The House divided Mr. Ell Bollard Lethbridge Hardy Massey Tellers.

Mr. WILFORD) (Wellington Suburbs) .-- Sir, I rise to move the second reading of this Bill. As honourable members will see, the measure having been circulated for some days, the Bill is one to enlarge the grounds upon which a divorce may be granted. Honourable mem- bers will know that under the statute of 1898 a divorce is obtainable, among other reasons, on the ground of desertion, and on the ground that the respondent has been convicted and sentenced to penal servitude for seven years or upwards for having attempted the life of the petitioner. Now, apart from the grounds I have just named, the principal alteration I propose in the law is this : To amend subsection (2) of section 3 of the principal Act of 1898, by insert- ing the word "three" in lieu of the word " five" next after the word "during." That is to say, I propose to give a petitioner the right 1 to a divorce from a respondent on the ground that the respondent has wilfully deserted the peti- tioner for three years or upwards. I wish to point out that for three hundred years from 1573 -the law of Scotland has been that a desertion for four years, without being a wilful desertion- that is to say, without any express intention to desert-is a ground for divorce, while wilful de- sertion is a ground for divorce if the deser- tion takes place for a period of only one year. If a woman is left by her husband wilfully for the period of three years it seems to me that she ought to have the right to go to a Court and get a divorce after that period. The Legislature has sanctioned five years already. The law of New South Wales and the law of Victoria is on the same line as the Scottish law. I am not asking to go so far as the Scottish law goes -namely, that a ground for a divorce shall be wilful desertion for one year. I ask for a divorce on the ground of desertion for three years. I am doing this, Sir, on account of representations that have been made to me, and I may say that one of the highest legal 
<page:137>
That may not be a recommendation to some members, but I am sure it will be to others. In the case of a woman deserted by her husband, and left with children to support, her husband may turn up for a night or two after an absence of, say, two or three years, and commence to ill-treat her, and then again leave her, and there is no possibility of her getting a divorce until the expiration of the five years provided by the Act of 1888, computed from the date of his second desertion. Numberless cases have been brought before the Courts in which simple judi- cial separations have been asked for, because the actual period had not elapsed, although all the consituent elements of actual desertion -- such as the husband writing and saying that he was not coming back again - were there ; and no matter how great a brute the husband may have been, a divorce could not, under the circumstances, be granted. A Bill embodying the clause as to divorce on the ground of three years' desertion was introduced into this House in 1887. Ex- actly the same clause was incorporated in that Bill. The second reading of the Bill of 1887 was carried easily, and among the names of those voting for it I notice that of the Right Hon. the Premier. In 1895 he voted against the second reading of the Bill providing for divorce on the ground of desertion for four years ; but he voted in favour of the Bill of 1887, along with Messrs. Monk, Duncan, Steward, and R. Thompson. The second read- ing of the Bill of 1895 was carried by a tremen- dous majority, amongst whom were no less than twenty-four members of the present House. I may say that I believe the Judges of the Supreme Court would be in favour of the passing of this amending measure, and I my- self have personally spoken to one of the Judges of the colony, who authorised me to say that he favours it. Mr. SEDDON. - It is very unusual to mention that on the floor of the House. Mr. WILFORD .- The honourable gentle- inan has created the precedent for the remark. Knowing the Judge, I telephoned to him to make sure on the point, and he said that he had no objection. The 2nd clause of the Bill is to amend subsection (4) of section 3 by inserting the word "five" instead of the word "seven." The meaning of the amend- ment is this: Under subsection (4) of section 3 of the Act of 1898 a petitione: is allowed a divorce from a respondent, if the respondent has been convicted and sentenced to imprison- ment or penal servitude for seven years for attempting the life of petitioner. If under our present law a petitioner is allowed a divorce from a respondent on the grounds of five years' desertion, then, surely she ought to be allowed a divorce on the ground that the respondent has been in gaol for five years. Why should it be made seven years in regard to imprisonment, while five years is the period for desertion. A man who will leave his wife for five years can be proceeded against for divorce; while the man who has brutally ill-used his wife The last clause is almost similar to that embodied in the Act of 1887, and it provides for a divorce on the ground that the respondent has for a period of five years been continuously contined in a lunatic asylum. Now, I admit that that clause is open to some argument. because there are arguments which, in the presence of the ladies in the gallery, it is in- advisable to discuss. I do not desire to in any way infringe upon what I consider good taste in the discussion of a matter like this, but I am prepared to admit there are arguments on both sides as to this clause. I think an amendment to clause 4 might be added, which I should be prepared to accept in Committee - namely, that i divorce on the ground of five years' continuous confinement in an asylum should not be granted unless the Medical Superintendent of the asylum should certify to the party who seeks the divorce that there is no likelihood of the patient in the asylum recovering. These are the three points upon which I am attempting to amend the Divorce Act of 1898. I shall content myself by putting the matter generally in this way, and propose deferring further argument until | honourable members have spoken, when I shall have my right of reply. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- Mr. Speaker, the honourable gentleman evidently is prepared for my objecting to this proposed amendment of the divorce law of the colony, and he quotes my having voted in 1887 for one of the proposed amendments -- namely, that seven years' wilful desertion should be a ground of divorce. An Hon. MEMBER .- And incarceration in an asylum also. Mr. SEDDON .-- I have not seen the voting on the Bill to which he refers, and I will take it for granted that what he says is correct ; but, Sir, if the honourable member will note, it appears that I was paired ; and, further, from that time forward he will find that with ripe years came wisdom, and a desire, as far as possible, to have it so that marriage should not be easily set aside, because the nation where that obtains must of a certainty, so far as its social structure is concerned, be weakened. That, Sir, is my contention. I say we must look upon marriage as being something beyond a simple contract, and if we do not we shall find our- selves drifting into a position which all well- wishers of our colony must regret. If you read about the divorce laws in America -- and we are following closely upon the marriage laws of that country-you will see what every earnest thinker and writer says upon the social conditions there. You have a lesson here. Only recently we have had cases in our own colony, where people have simply left New Zea- land and gone to America, and the next thing you find is that proceedings have been instituted for divorce, that those proceedings have been successful, and then that another marriage has taken place. Well, all I can say is that I do not think that is desirable in the interests of the rising generation, and that we must look ahead. Now, when the present Act was 
<page:138>
9.0. had been well considered, came to the conclusion that the five years was a fair com- promise as between what had been contended by those opposing it, and on that condition solely it passed through Committee and was placed on the statute-book of the colony. Such being the case, I say we should have something more than primitive reasons - I must not be ungenerous with the honourable member, but in dealing with such a grave sul ject as this we should have weightier arguments than those given by the honourable member. To my mind, considering the gravity of the subject, he dealt somewhat flippantly with this question. I say this because he did not give any reasons. I say he ought to have shown that since we have had the Act with the five years' limit in it there has been a large number of women or men who have suffered and who will suffer by it. I say he has given no such reasons whatever. Mr. WILFORD .- Do you want names ? Mr. SEDDON .- No, I do not want names. You laid no stress on that. The honourable gentleman never attempted to prove to the House that between the three and the five years there were a number or wives of hus- bands who had suffered. Mr. WILFORD .- I said there were. Mr. SEDDON. You want to do something more than that. If there was any general de- sire for this change members of this House would have heard of it. We should have heard it through, the Press ; there would have been a general feeling in favour of this measure ; and  I must say at once that I have never heard any general desire for this extension. In my posi- tion, if there was any real grievance, or any number of persons were injured or suffering, I should say I should hear of it as well as any other man in the country. I may say I have not had, since the passing of that Act, a single case brought under my notice. Suppose there may be a few isolated cases of wives who suffer, is it to relieve that suffering that you are going to strike a blow at your whole social structure? I say it is better that there should be a few suffer under those conditions, and wait for the two years, than that you should pass a law making it easy for a young couple, who have been together only a few months, and between whom a difference of opinion arises, to say to each other, "You go your way, and I will go mine. ' I ask members. before they pass this, to pause, and not to treat it lightly. lask honourable members to allow the Act to work a little longer, and let us see whether there is a necessity, before we agree to so important an amendment. And then, again, I ask you to judge our country and our colony by its pro- ceedings. Get a return of the divorce pro- ceedings in our Supreme Court, and com- pare your Court records with what ex.sted before the passing of that Act, and then judge New Zealand as it stood before and as it stands to-day in regard to these pro- ceedings. And let me say here, I am sorry Mr. Seldon ings, in all their hideous nakedness, to the world. Does that help to improve the morals of the country? Does that hold up our country in a favourable light to other nations ? I say it does not. It detracts from our moral standard. We are like other nations, and there have been, and will be for all time, differences in the matrimonial circle, and there may be bad men and men who ill-treat their wives ; but I say it does no good whatever with respect to these proceedings to have them published to the world as we have had them. I may pro- bably be taken to task for taking up the part of mentor with respect to this question; but, at the same time, the more easy you make it by the amendments that are now proposed the more likely you are to have this increased num- ber of proceedings. And then we are told that the law is, I think the honourable member said, four years' desertion in the neighbouring colonies. Mr. WILFORD .- I said desertion is one year in Scotland. Mr. SEDDON. - But you said in one colony. Mr. WILFORD. - Victoria and New South Wales. Mr. SEDDON .- In Victoria it is four years' desertion ? Mr. WILFORD .- Yes. Mr. SEDDON .- Very well, that is a year against your contention, because you propose to make it three years, so that you would make it easier in New Zealand by a vear than it is in the neighbouring colonies. My answer to that is this : look at the records, and, again, at the number of divorce proceedings in Australia, and contrast that with what obtained previously, and even contrast it with what is the case now in New Zealand, and you will notice that they are in the other colonies fast drifting into a state of Americanism, and their divorce pro- ceedings there are such as I hope will never ob- tain in the colony of New Zealand. I say it is not much to the credit of any country to have the columns of its papers filled up with these cases, and to find that the majority of the cases in its Supreme Court are divorce proceedings. I undertake to say that since the passing of the Act which the honourable gentleman proposes now to amend, there has been a considerable increase in the number of cases in the Divorce Courts of our colony. I am speaking from memory now; at all events, I will say there has been a very large number in excess of what previously prevailed. Then. as to the question which the honoural le gentleman has raised as to the imprisonment, or where attempts have been made on the life of the wife : contrast that with the ordinary imprisonment, and I can only say this : that there may be good reasons why ; and, where the imprisonment has taken place, and knowing for what the man could be imprisoned, the wife would be the last who would ask that there should be the relaxation that the honoural le member proposes in his Bill. I say it has not been asked for. Again, I ask : 
<page:139>
has not been asked for, why do you want to put it on the statute-book ? Why facilitate the ap- plication ? I do not think that special argument would apply ; but, at all events, all I can say is this : Where you want to alter the law you should show that there are suffering women who want relief as provided by this amendment. Proof of the necessity of the Bill should be given by the honourable member introducing the Bill. In such cases we might apply the old Grecian principle : that a man bringing in a measure should give good reasons for it ; and such person used to come in with a halter round his neck, and if he proved the necessity for the measure the halter was removed. We come now to the proposed amendment, and the honourable member admits that it is tender ground when he proposes an amendment in re- spect to the husband being confined in a lunatic asylum. Honourable members debating that provision are somewhat restricted owing to the presence of ladies in the gallery, but with- out at all departing from the canons of good taste, I will say this : that the precaution which the honourable member proposes - namely, a statement by the Superintendent of the Asylum as to whether or not at the end of five years the husband or the wife, as the case might be, may be restored to sound reason - I say that would be a very dangerous position to allow in our legislation. That has always been combatted and prevented. We allow nothing less than two medical men, outside altogether of the officer who has control of the asylum ;  and it only shows the weakness of the honourable member's case when he is pre- paired to do this on the word of the Super- intendent If the Superintendent says : "I think there will be a chance of the patient being restored to reason," then, and in that case there is not to be a divorce. I think when the honourable member comes to consider it, he will agree that, at all events, that part of the Bill ought to be eliminated. It is quite clear to me that the honourable member does not intend to fight that at all. I say this, in con- clusion : we have had no good and sufficient grounds given for making the amendment now proposed, and until good and sufficient ground is shown, if we err at all it should be on the side of caution, and I believe the maintenance of our marriage law as intact as we possibly can is the wisest course to follow. Mr. HUTCHESON. You are getting con- servative. Mr. SEDDON .- Well, Sir, I have always been conservative when it comes to conserving the social and moral well-being of the people of our country. I should, Sir, prefer to be in that position, rather than in the position of one who would treat lightly the marriage state, or who would allow on the flimsiest pre- text separation or divorce as between man and wife. I speak now as a man well on in years, and know many cases where, if this law had obtained, there would have been separations for all time, but owing to the then existing state of honourable member in this amendment. Even admitting that there are a few cases of wil- ful desertion, where there is no hope, I believe it is better that those few people should suffer than that you should extend your laws in the direction now proposed. That I think is sound logic. You must consider the greater number, and not make the conditions so easy that after a separation of three years a divorce can be obtained. Take the case of men who follow a seafaring life, or of those who have gone to the front, or of some of those who have left our own colony without any intention what- ever of deserting-because I have known of one or two cases where the co-respondent came and proved that there was no wilful attempt to desert ; the time is so short that many a divorce might take place which might be afterwards re- gretted. I say it is not at all in the interests of the country to have too many divorce proceed- ings. It is not well for any country to treat lightly its marriage laws, and I say our pre- sent sound social structure should be main- tained until good and sufficient reasons are shown for an alteration. I do not think the honourable member attempted to show that there were good and sufficient reasons for the proposed extension, and, such being the case, 1 shall vote against the second reading of the Bill. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton) .- I object to clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill. I think they go in the direction of widening the doors of the Divorce Court far too much ; but I do think that something is necessary in the direc- tion of clause 4. It appears to me that we ought to pass the second reading of the Bill, in order to endeavour to do some measure of justice to those persons who are unhappily married to confirmed lunatics. The Right Hon. the Premier asked for a case. I have no doubt he himself has met in the course of his ex- perience many such cases. I myself met one some few years ago in the City of Wellington, where there was a highly respectable woman, who was keeping a lodging-house, living and maintaining herself in the utmost respecta- bility. She was the wife of a man who for eighteen years had been confined in a lunatic asylum. That woman, I believe, had had more than one offer of marriage, which would have placed her beyond the neces- sity of earning her own livelihood, but on account of our law making no pro- vision for such cases she has to go through life without assistance from a husband. I have heard of cases of a similar kind in other parts of the colony, and I think the Premier might so modify his objection as to allow the Bill to go to its second reading, and then have a clause drafted, with proper safe- guards, to allow of divorce proceedings being instituted in cases of lengthened and confirmed lunacy. I do not say I would limit the time to five years as proposed, I would be prepared to grant a longer period; but we ought not to say that those who, by the dispensation of provi-

with some other person. Major STEWARD (Waitaki) .- My views are very much the same as those enunciated by the honourable gentleman who has just sat down. The mover of the Bill mentioned that in some previous year I voted for the second reading of a Bill which contained a provision which would enable three years' desertion to be a ground for divorce. I believe that is so ; but it was not because I approved of that parti- cular period, but because I desired to include in the Bill-and succeeded in doing so afterwards -a clause which would enable divorce to be obtained in cases where one of the parties to marriage had attempted the life of the other, and been sentenced for such offence to im- prisonment for seven years or upwards. I do not approve of the period of three years' deser- tion being made a ground for divorce. If the Bill is read a second time the honourable gentle- man should strike out that provision. I think the existing Act is liberal enough in that direc- tion by making the period five years. In re- gard to the next proposal of the Bill, I can understand the honourable gentleman's desire to place the law on all - fours as regards the period in relation to each cause for divorce. At present we make the period in the case of de- sertion five years ; and it does seem logical that when imprisonment is the ground the period should also be five years; but I do not think any strong cause has been made out for going any further in this direction than we have. But there is, as regards clause 4, an arguable  ground for adding this as a ground for divorce -I refer to the question of insanity. Of course it is a misfortune, and there is no element of fault, as there is as regards desertion and im- prisonment. As regards insanity, the insane is not a person in fault, but in misfortune, and therefore the position is different. But it may be argued, and I think rightly, that it is not desirable that persons should live to- gether in marriage when one of the parties has been for five years admittedly insane. I think, indeed, that it is very undesirable with regard to its effect on future generations, and that the honourable member who submits this Bill has reason on his side in asking the House to extend the divorce law so as to include insanity as a ground of divorce, provided always that there are proper safeguards. I do not know whether the suggestion made by him goes far enough. The Premier suggested that there should be a report by two independent medical mon outside of the doctor of the asylum ; and that, I think, goes in the right direction, and something in this direction should be added to clause 4 of the Bill. I only wish further to refer to one remark made by the Premier -- namely, that there has been a very much larger number of cases of divorce brought before the Courts since the passing of the ne v Act than Well, Sir, of course, that in previous years. Seeing that we made de- naturally follows. sertion for a certain number of years a ground Mr. G. W. Russell provided by the Legislature- Mr. SEDDON .- It should not continue. Major STEWARD .- And it will not con- tinue. Mr. SEDDON. -- It is continuing. Major STEWARD. - Possibly the honourable gentleman has not allowed sutheient time for the whole of these cases to be brought before the Courts; but I think it will be found in years to come that the number of divorces on the ground of desertion will be very much smaller than it has been, because the cases that have arisen from desertion in the past will, it is to be presumed, soon be disposed of. However, I am not prepared to say that there is any urgent demand for this Bill, but I shall vote for the second reading solely on the ground that I think something in the direction of clause 4 is necessary. Mr. FLATMAN (Geraldine) .-- I would like to say a few words on this Bill. I understood the honourable gentleman who had just spoken to say that he voted for the second reading of a similar Bill some two or three sessions ago, with the understanding that the words " for attempting the life of the petitioner " were to be added to the clause. Well, Sir, it is proposed in this Bill to erase those words, and I think that is a mistake, because one can understand that if a husband is sentenced to a term of im- prisonment for attempting to take the life of his wife, it is more than likely that they will never care to live with each other again, and I think these words ought to remain. In regard to the question of the reduction of the term for desertion from five to three years, it was in 1893 the reduction to three years took place in New South Wales and Victoria, and the first year after the amending Act came into opera tion there were 306 cases of divorce in the former colony, while in the previous year there were only 102. The number of cases has not diminished to any extent, for in 1894 we find there were 313 cases, in 1895 there were 301, in 1896 234, in 1897 246, and in 1898 247 ; while the highest in New Zea- land during that time was thirty-six in any one year, which shows plainly that the door for divorce is opened too widely in New South Wales. I am of the same opinion as the Premier - namely, that we might allow our present Act to remain in force and see how it works. Had I not seen these figures relating to New South Wales and Victoria, where in the year 1897 there were 117 cases of divorce, I should have voted for the second reading of the Bill. But, after seeing these figures, I 9.30. certainly must vote against the second reading of the Bill, because I do not think it would be in the interest of the colony to pass such a measure. Mr. T. MACKENZIE (Waihemo) .- Sir, I in- tend to oppose the second reading of this Bill. It seems to me that the whole trend of the legislation of this country is to extend too great facilities for divorce. I largely indorse the

present obtaining, it is too soon to ask for further alterations. Mr. ATKINSON (Wellington City) .- Sir, this Bill is certainly an improvement upon the Bill which the member for the Wellington Suburbs introduced last session. In one respect, however, it is certainly rather worse than the previous Bill, in that there is no clause as to reserving the operation of the Act-if it becomes an Act -- for the signification of His Majesty's pleasure. Now, that is an oversight which we can rectify if the Bill gets into Committee. An Hon. MEMBER .- It is provided for other- wise . Mr. ATKINSON .- It is commonly provided in the Bill. An Hon. MEMBER .- It is never provided for. Mr. ATKINSON. - I beg the honourable gentleman's pardon ; if he will look at the last Divorce Act, which we are now amending, he ; some amendment in the direction proposed will find that it is so provided. Section 2 of " The Divorce Act. 1898," says,- " This Act shall come into operation on a day to be fixed by the Governor by Proclama- ; the contrary, it is no argument to say there tion in the Gazette ; such day to be not less than one month from the day upon which notice of Her Majesty's approval of the same I great hardship. If we can remove or alleviate shall be published in the said Gazette." There is another peculiarity in the drafting of the Divorce Bill of last session which is re peated here, and that is that the last clause, which in this case is the important one, is put somewhat tentatively in the form of a resolu- tion. Instead of saying " The following subsec- tion is added to section 3 of the principal Act," clause 4 says " That the following subsection be added to section 3 of the principal Act." That, of course, is the tentative language of a ; resolution, and not the enacting declaration of a statute. However, with regard to the sub- ject-matter of the Bill, I think it is a very great improvement on the measure of last session. am unable to agree with the proposal of clause 2. that the period of desertion which shall entitle | the petititioner to obtain a divorce shall be . attitude with regard to that clause. I should diminished from five to three years. I agree with the arguments of all preceding speakers, with the exception of the honourable member : be a proper safegard ; but I think the evil, for Wellington Suburbs, in preferring the pre- ; though it may be limited to a small number sent term to three years. As to the proposal of clause 3, which will reduce the period of imprison- ' ment for which the respondent shall have been sentenced to entitle the petitioner to a divorce, ; I see, as the honourable member for Waitaki observed, that there is a good deal to be said from the point of view of the honourable mem- : gate that evil. I shall vote for the second read- ber for Wellington Suburbs ; and his arguments gain a good deal of force from the contention that the period should be made the same throughout. I ain inclined to think-I may be said to be , sitting on a rail at present that if five years is a reasonable period to fix for desertion, five years is a reasonable period to fix here. But. of course, the most important part of the third clause is that which limits the nature of the : House, to see what can be made of it in Com- crime for which a divorce may be obtained. It ' mittee. But nothing the Right Hon. the Pre- Wellington Suburbs that this is not the only class of offence for which the term of im- prisonment for seven or five years should entitle the petitioner to obtain a divorce. At the same time I do not feel justified, accord- ing to my present lights, in voting that a sentence of imprisonment for any crime at all for, say, five years should entitle the peti- tioner to obtain a divorce. I should like further time to consider and hear more dis- cussion on clause 3 before having to vote upon it. However, it is certain that clause 4 is the most important clause in the Bill. I approve of the arguments of the Right Hon. the Pre- mier, from a general standpoint, with regard to the inadvisability of tampering lightly with our divorce law ; but I do not see that any of the general considerations he urged fairly met the very strong ground of public policy, on which by clause 4 is based. We. do not desire that the progeny of lunatics shall be increased by the compulsion of law in this colony. On i is a small number of cases. There may be a small number of cases, and yet it may be a the hardship, without admitting at the same time a greater evil, it is our duty to do so. Now, what greater evil are we to admit if, with proper safeguards, we enact that lunacy for five years shall be a ground for divorce ? I fail to see that we shall be admitting any evil at all, providing, of course, that the safeguards are proper. The Right Hon. the Premier gave us a reason for supposing that the safeguard the member for Wellington Suburbs was willing to have added was insufficient. Perhaps the honourable member may not be willing to con- cede so much, but, at any rate, it shows he is prepared to have the clause thoroughly threshed out, and to have inserted in it whatever safe- guard appears. on consideration, to be a just and proper one. I understood that to be his not like to say off-hand, any more than would any other member of the House, what would of cases, is so serious that some remedy should be provided for it, and for that reason- though if I had to decide on clause 4 to-night by my single vote I should vote against it-but, on the ground that there is a great evil, and that this clause if properly amended may miti- The member for Wellington ing of the Bill. Suburbs has referred to the fact that he moved the second reading of this Bill po forma last year, with the view of having it referred to the Statutes Revision Committee; and I hope that after the debate this evening the Bill will be referred to that Committee, to be thoroughly overhauled, and then brought back to the 
<page:142>
which it is proposed to cure by this clause, or that the evil cannot be cured satisfactorily by this clause, with the necessary amendments, and for that reason I shall vote for the second read- ing of the Bill. Mr. LAURENSON (Lyttelton) .- Sir, I shall support the second reading of this Bill, although I shall reserve to myself the right to oppose clauses 2 and 3 when the Bill is in Committee. I am opposed to both of those clauses, but I am much in favour of clause 4. As an illustration to show how clause 4 would work, I know of the case of a man in my own electorate whose wife has been in an asylum for fifteen years, and yet who cannot get relief from the marriage tie. I would suppor this clause to allow divorce to be granted after one of the parties has been in an asylum for five years, because I am of the opinion that it is bad for the com. munity to allow people to resume marital re- lations after one of the parties has been in an asylum. I will therefore vote for the second reading of the Bill, reserving the right to oppose clauses 2 and 3 in Committee. As re- gards clause 3, which alters the word "seven " to "five," and gives the wife of a man who has been imprisoned for five years the right to a divorce, and vice versa, I would like to give the honourable member who introduced the Bill an instance that came under my notice. I remem- ber the case of a man who, after being sentenced to eight years' penal servitude, resumed his posi- tion as head of the family after his release, and who has ever since been a most exemplary father and husband. Nothing whatever has  been said against him since. Under this clause his wife would have been entitled to a divorce, and if she, in a fit of spleen, had applied for a divorce the peace of that family would have been destroyed for all time. But, as I have already said, I am in favour of clause 4, which provides that a man or a woman who has been confined in an asylum shall not be entitled to resume the marital relations. As to the Pre- mier's remarks, I am partly in favour of and partly against them. I believe, where a man and a woman are happily united, that, if the door of the Divorce Court was as wide as the prairies, they would not walk through it. On the other hand, in the case of a man who is united to an uncongenial partner, or a woman who is married to a human brute, it does not matter how strong you make the divorce laws you will have domestic misery, and have all sorts of evils arising from such unions. You may have legal union, but you will have moral and mental divorce. That being so, I shall vote for the second reading of the Bill, reserving to myself the right to have clauses 2 and 3 altered. Mr. MONAB (Mataura) .- It was not my in- tention to speak on this Bill, nor would I have done so had it not been for the interjection I made to the honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Atkinson). I believe that the time- honoured custom that one connected with the Mr. Atkinson be departed from. The honourable gentleman said to-night that it would be better if there had been inserted in this Bill a clause providing that it should not come into force until the King had first given his assent, and I inter- jected that that was not necessary. In answer to something else, I further interjected that it was not done in the case of previous legislation on this subject. I understood the honourable gentleman to say that it had been done, and he referred to the Divorce Act of 1898 as a proof of his contention ; and the honourable member for Palmerston, sitting behind him, interjected that I had something to do with that, suggesting that I ought to have known that it was contained in the Bill. Under section 57 of the Constitution Act, His Excel- lency the Governor has to reserve for the Royal assent such Bills as he shall be ordered to reserve by Royal instructions. On the 26th March, 1892, Royal instructions directed all Bills dealing with divorce to be reserved for the Royal assent. The Constitution Act provides that, on the Royal assent being given, the Divorce Bill becomes law. Now, the Act of 1898 did not provide that on the Royal assent being given the Divorce Bill of that year was to become law. It provided that the Bill should not become law until the Governor's proclamation was issued in this colony after the Royal assent had been given, and it did not provide that the Bill should be reserved for the Royal assent before it became law. An Hon. MEMBER .- Read the section. Mr. McNAB .- The section I refer to is this, " This Act shall come into operation on a day to be fixed by the Governor by Proclamation in the Gazette ; such day to be not less than one month from the day upon which notice of Her Majesty's approval of the same shall be pub- lished in the Gazette." The Constitution Act and the Royal instruc tion provide for the Royal assent to be given, and it it had not been for this clause 2 the Act of 1898 would have been brought into operation on the day on which it received the Royal assent, but that date was postponed for one month by this section 2. There is no case that I have come across, certainly not in the Act of 1898, reserving a Divorce Bill for the Royal assent. Mr. ATKINSON .- As a matter of personal explanation, the honourable member for Ma- taura seems to have misunderstood me, or else to have misunderstood his own Act of 18.8. Of course, I was not suggesting that the honour- able member for the Suburbs would properly have included in his Bill a clause that reserved it in express terms for the Roval assent. I would not dream of suggesting that in fact, I had the Bill of last session before me as I spoke, and I simply summarised the fact that the 2nd clause in the Bill dealt with the question of reservation, and that matter had been omitted here. The 2nd clause of Mr. Wil- \- \-- 
<page:143>
taura's Bill of 1898. Well, I do not think any explanation I can make will make the matter clearer. I was simply calling attention to the fact that it appeared to me that the Bill of the honourable member for the Suburbs, Mr. Wil- ford, was not quite as good a Bill this session, because he was not following so precisely in the footsteps of the honourable member for Ma- taura. And now the honourable member for Mataura gets up and explains that the section in the Act of 1893 was quite unnecessary, and the honourable member for the Suburbs did better when he did not follow the honourable member tor Mataura at all. Mr. WILFORD (Wellington Suburbs) .- Sir, I shall first of all deal with the speech on this Bill delivered by the Right Hon. the Premier, and I propose to show the House, without the slightest difficulty, that if ever any honourable member in this House turned a somersault the Hon. the Premier has done so : whether he has lit on his feet or not, I will leave honourable members to judge. Now, in the first place, the Right Hon. the Premier discusses with a great deal of-well. strength- Mr. PIRANI. - Pomposity. Mr. WILFORD .- No, I am not going to be rude-there is nothing to be gained by that. The Right Hon. the Premier discussed, in a way I think it hardly necessary to describe, what he called the flippancy with which I had introduced this measure. Now, "flippancy" is a word that hardly applies to the Right Hon. the Premier; but when we remember  the speech he delivered against the Bill, one hardly knows what word of the Eng. lish language would describe it. He dragged in a description of himself being dragged up by block and tackle to be weighed ; he described a member being dragged into this Chamber with a halter round his neck and being dragged out again ; and his speech was generally discussing matters absolutely irre- levant and absolutely apart from the Bill alto- gether. Let me tell honourable members this : that in 18-7 the Right Hon. the Premier not only supported every one of these clauses I am introducing, but he went further. When I say that the Right Hon. the Premier supported the clauses I should not say that he voted for them -he paired in favour of them. In 1-87 a Bill was introduced by another member of the Bar, Mr. Samuel, of New Plymouth, and in connec- tion with that Bill Mr. Samuel proposed the following amendments to the divorce law. First of all,- " That the respondent has, without just cause or excuse, wilfully deserted the petitioner, and, without any such cause or excuse, left him or her so deserted during three years or upwards continuously before the presentation of the petition." That is the very clause that is in my Bill. Now, the Right Hon. the Premier denounced in unmeasured terms the idea of the House, for social reasons, supporting such an innovation, and yet the Right Hon. the Premier paired in word " five " in lieu of the word " seven "-that is to say, giving the petitioner power to obtain a divorce on the ground of a man having been in prison or having suffered penal servitude for a period of five years, instead of seven years. Would the Premier be surprised to know that the very Bill which he paired for in 1887 had these words in it : - "That the respondent is, and for not less than twelve months before the presentation of the petition has been, imprisoned for some crime under sentence, or a commuted sentence, for a term of seven years or upwards ; or, being a husband, has, by frequent convictions for crime, habitually left his wife without the means of support." That is my clause, only the Premier asked for a longer period-seven years-and I ask for five. Now, the 3rd clause in the Bill is the one which the Premier denounced in such measured terms that I was, theoretically speaking, scorched up. In my Bill, in clause 4, I ask that a divorce may be granted on the ground that the respondent has been continuously in a lunatic asylum for a period of five years. The Premier suggests that the period of five years is too small, and objects to the clause altogether. How did we find him voting in 1887? "That if the respondent was incurably insane, and had been in an asylum for three years," he would support it, and I am asking for five years. How do honourable members reconcile the position of the Premier ? Then, the Premier charged mo with not having given examples for these clauses being in my Bill. I did not give them for a good reason. I could not give the reasons in regard to clause 4 on account of the presence of ladies in the gallery, and I said so when I intro- duced the Bill. It was not a subject to be discussed in the presence of ladies. Even if I have to suffer for it, by losing clause 4, I will do so rather than offend in that respect. In regard to clauses 2 and 3 I will give good reasons for their introduction. I will admit that the Premier is a man of vast experience, that his knowledge is wide, varied, and of a range that it will probably never be in my province to reach ; but let me tell the Right Hon. the Premier this : that I claim to have a little experience in connection with the matter I am discussing, and perhaps I might be able to teach the Premier in regard to this par- ticular Bill. When he says that divorces have occurred with greater frequency in the colony since this Bill of 1898 passed, I say, certainly that is so. And why? Because there is a new ground for divorce allowed. Before 1898 you could not get a divorce for five years' deser- tion ; now you can. Consequently, when you give new grounds for divorce, you naturally create more divorces, because you have opened up new avenues by which divorces may be obtained. Consequently, when the old ground still remains and the new grounds are available, it naturally follows that there are more divorces. What was the use of our legislation if it was not so ? 
<page:144>
ported in the newspapers. But what in the world has that got to do with my Bill ? I am quite prepared to admit, as to that matter, that another of the clauses of the Act of 1898 ought to be more frequently used than it is at present. I have argued in favour of that before now. Under the Act of 1898, if application is made to the Judge, the case can be heard in camera, and I can tell honourable members of the House that many cases are now heard in camera, and nobody knows that a divorce has been granted, or that the proceedings have been taken at all. An Hon. MEMBER. - That is not a very good thing. Mr. WILFORD. -- I grant that it is not a very good thing when both sides are not represented, but it is a good thing when both sides are repre- sented. However, that clause is already in vogue. I admit, as I have said, that the newspapers should not publish the details of these divorce proceedings ; but what has that got to do with my Bill ? Now. Sir, honourable members have asked me for reasons in support of the amend- ments that this Bill proposes, and I will give them one or two. Does the Premier expect to have these reasons ? I can prove to the honour- able member that women in Napier and in Gisborne, as well as here in Wellington, have written to me applying for clause 2 and clause 4 and clause 3 of the Bill. I can say that there are cases that have come within my own know- ledge which show the necessity for these clauses. When these women above referred to heard that I was introducing a Divorce Bill. they wrote  asking me whether these things could be done. I will give you a case where a man has deserted his wife for four years. Until he had deserted her for five years she could not have got a divorce. But just when the four years were up, and before the five years were expired, he was run into gaol for a term of seven years, and the divorce could not be granted for four years' desertion, for the seven years' imprisonment did not count as desertion. Notwithstanding that the man was in gaol for seven years, the poor woman could not get a divorce for five years' desertion. That is one case. I will give you another case. It is a case where a woman left her husband for two years. After that she got seven years' hard labour in this town. But he cannot get a divorce from her. That is not all. She has got seven years to serve in gaol, and she had left her home for two years before that, leaving him with five or six children, and there is no pos- sible way for him to get a divorce. Take an- other case. There is a young woman in this district who is working as a stewardess in one of the boats trading in this colony, and her hus- band is one of the most notorious burglars, I think I may say, in the whole of Australasia ; in fact, as a sort of shot, I put my finger on him as having been the individual who has robbed that widow of #800, as described in the cables the other day, because that is the particular line he has adopted in all his depredations. Now, Mr. Wilford month out of her wages for the keep of her family. What happens ? This man is nearly always in gaol. He got two years in Dunedin some time ago for practising the confidence trick. He broke his leg while in gaol, and got off with a commutation of part of his term be- cause of good behaviour. He comes back to his wife for a week or two, makes her life miser- able, bangs the children about, and then pro- bably before he has been in town for a few months he is in gaol again for some other offence. In fact. he has been arrested in nearly every town in New Zealand. That poor woman praved to me to do something for her relief, but nothing can be done as matters stand under the present law. Of course, for habitual cruelty and habitual drunkenness it would come under another clause of the Bill. I can enumerate instance after instance where this Bill is required, and I can show documentary evi- dence, and evidence from the Courts. to show that greater facilities should be granted. I quite agree with the remarks of the honour- able member for Lyttelton, Mr. Laurenson, that if two people are happily married 10.0. there is no gate-no matter how wide -that will induce them to walk through it and ask for a divorce. But in the case of those who are unhappily married the position is different ; and when you look at the marital relations of some people, you will agree that it is better for themselves that some relief should be given. If you read Lombroso and Havelock Ellis on the doctrines of Criminology, it is a question whether, when a husband becomes a criminal, a woman ought not to have a divorce immediately. Read statistics, and the books on Criminal Anthropology, and what do you find ? That a criminal father begets criminal children, and that goes down from generation to generation. I could give honourable members more reasons in favour of this measure. If honourable mem- bers want to alter the Bill in Committee I shall be reasonable, and shall be glad to accept any reasonable amendments. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- The honourable member attempted to lead the House to believe that I voted for and supported certain amend- ments. An Hon. MEMBER. - " Paired," he said. Mr. SEDDON .- He said paired subsequently. His first statement was that I voted for and supported the amendments. I think he re- ferred to the year 1887. In respect to the Bill itself I paired : but if he had looked up the records of the debates he would have seen that in cases of continued brutality I advocated that women ought to be relieved, and provision was made to give them relief. I paired on Mr. Samuel's amendment. If the honourable member had done me the justice of looking \- up Hansard he would have seen that the very first time that the same provision came up I was in my place in the House, and I spoke against it, which is consistent with what I have done to-night. Furthermore, on this ques-

Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston) .- This is almost a copy of the measure I introduced last session dealing with the subject of school attendance, and perhaps it is a satisfactory thing to know that the Government have practically adopted my Bill of last year, and are persevering, I believe, with that. But I generally progress, and the measure as introduced this year is, I think, a distinct improvement on that of last wear. I forwarded a copy of the Bill to every Education Board in the colony last year, and it is in accordance with suggestions received from them-especially the Otago Board-that the measure is in the shape it is to-night. I shall deal just briefly with the difference between the measure and the existing law. I propose, in the first plase, to include in the definition of public schools, at which at- tendance is compulsory within the provisions of the Act. private day-schools, because it is found in practical working that children are en- rolled in private schools without the attendance provisions being complied with, and thus the compulsory attendance is evaded. I have also included in the compulsory provisions Maoris or half-castes who attend the public schools. We have found in the Wanganui district that Maoris, although their children attend public schools when it suits them, interrupt the course of instruction very much by taking the children away for weeks and months; and we have no Further, the period in which action can be VOL. CXVII .-- 9. attendance, and I think it is desirable that such power should be granted. I have defined "attendance " as two hours of instruction, so if there are four hours a day for five days they will have ten attendances. Instead of the age in the original Act-from seven to thirteen- being the age of compulsory attendance, it is extended in this measure to fifteen, unless they have passed the standard required by the Edu- cation Department-namely, the Fifth Stan- dard. The attendances in this measure are defined as four attendances out of six times open; six out of eight times open; and eight out of ten times open. Per- sonally, I do not see why the children should not be compelled to attend every time in the week that the school is open, unless they come under the exemptions. The exemptions are so extensive that they cover almost every reason for a child being legitimately absent from school. Then, we ought to stop the law prevailing at the present time when there is a holiday in the week, of not being able to compel the child to attend school during the rest of the week in which there is a holiday, because, if you say that out of the ten times the school is only open eight times, in that way there is a week blank so far as the attendance is con- cerned. There is also another difficulty. When you only compel six attendances out of ten, and that child attends Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in one week, and does not go back to school until the Wednesday in the following week, he will have been a week away from school. In some districts this is worked with scientific accuracy, to the detriment both of the attendance of the school and of the child itself. And then, in respect to the two miles distance from the school to which compulsory attendance applied, I have increased the dis- tance to four miles, provided there is a good road from the residence of the child's parents or guardian to the school, or a similar distance between the residence and the railway con- venient to the school, and the railway and the school. Then, there is another very neces- sary provision for enforcing a case where a child does not attend school at all. Under the present Act a notice is given to a parent to send the child to school, but there is no period prescribed within which that notice must be complied with, with the result that that clause of the Act is a dead-letter. I propose to make seven days after notice has been given as the time within which the child shall comply with the order of the Court. In regard to the excuse for having been absent from school, in clause 5 I have omitted the words " being in good health." This places on the parent the onus of proving that the child is not in good health when absent from school ; whereas at the present time only the Truant Inspector has to prove that the child is in good health, and it is almost an impossibility for him to do so unless at the time the child was absent from school he has been a constant visitor at that child's home. 
<page:146>
to two months, because it has been found that in a large district it is impossi! le for a Truant Officer, in very many cases, to lay the informa- tion within the period prescribed by the 1894 Act ; and in connection with that a provision is inserted by which the Magistrate, in dealing with the case, may take into consideration the age of the child and the distance the child has to travel to go to school. Then, there is another provision : that penalties which are levied shall not be paid to the School Committee fund, as : of 1894 is, in effect, a dead-letter ; it is of little provided in the original Act, but to the Board fund, where they employ Truant Inspectors. 1 'hands of School Committees or of the officials might say that I have had some years' ex- ! perience as Chairman of the Attendance Com- | in the way expected seven years ago.

I trust mem- bers will give me their active support in passing a measure which I am sure will tend to in- crease the attendance at the primary schools. Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister for Public Works) .- That there is some necessity for a i School Attendance Bill is evidenced by the fact that the Government have in another place a Bill of a similar nature to this Bill, and dealing with the same subject. That Bill has already passed its second reading, and will in due course reach this House. I rather expected the honourable gentleman, in view of that fact, would have taken into consideration the ad- visability of allowing this Bill to be left over. However, I see no objection to passing the second reading. although some of its pro- visions as they now appear are rather harsh. For instance, to insist on a certain number of attendances and to compel a child to go four miles to school is parsh, inasmuch as, while     you may have a goed road, you cannot control It is true that if an action is the weather. brought against the parents this fact may be brought forward as evidence in defence, but the distance is certainly too great. Mr. PIRANI. The Government has fixed three miles. Mr. HALL-JONES. - Yes : and I suppose the honoarable member has gone a little bet- ter, in order to have some distinction between the two Bills. But, in any case. I think three miles is a reasonable distance which one might expect a child to go to school. There are several other matters in the Bill which are, however, Committee objections. The alteration proposed in the management of Native schools is a radi- cal change, inasmuch as it proposes to place the management of Native schools under the control of Native Committees. At present honourable members are aware that these schools are controlled by the department. I am not sure as to the advisability of the course proposed in this Bill, because there might be a difficulty in obtaining the assist- ance and co-operation of the Natives in carry- ing out the work efficiently ; and especially with Native schools is constant care and con stant control required. and to a much greater Mr. Pirani have a Bill in another place which will reach this House shortly, and we may perhaps em- body some of the best provisions of this Bill in it. In the meantime the Bill may be read & : second time. Mr. TANNER (Avon) .-- Sir, I consider that the honourable gentleman in introducing this Bill is doing a public service, because something of this nature is necessary to supplement our i education system. The School Attendance Act It has not strengthened the For no service. who are appointed to enforce school attendance House ; but in the main the Bill, I believe, is good, and goes in the right direction. The ques- tion of distance, which has been mentioned, is one that I know is got over in some thinly populated districts by means of a method of co-operation which prevails amongst the residents, whereby a farmer-the father of children who are attending school - will, fairly early in the morning, put his child- ren into a vehicle, drive round and pick up the children of a number of his neighbours, and deliver them, as it were, at the school in time for attendance. The same thing is by arrange- ment taken up by another neighbour the next day, and by that practice during the week half a dozen people spend a couple of hours of their time in seeing that the whole of the children in It is an a given vicinity attend the school. admirable instance of co-operation. That, of course, would not apply where the road is practically impassable, as has been referred to. But what I rose to call attention to in par- ticular is the manner in which school attend- ance is evaded be the plea of parents when summoned that their children are in attendance at private schools. Sir, there is no more pain- ful business thin to sit as a Justice of the Peace at the Court and have a batch of poor, miserable women brought before ene charged with neglecting to send their children to school. I speak of Christchurch only for the moment, but I dare say the same practice prevails "Ise- where. It is the most frequent custom in the world for them to produce a little slip of paper, signed by some teacher or other at a private school, to the effect that Micky O'Flynn or Johnny Smith is in attendance at that school. On inquiry afterwards it is found that the name was entered on the school-roll perhaps that very morning. Provably that is the only attendance the child ever makes, but the plea is sufficient, and, no matter how ardent a Jus- tice of the Peace may be to see that the Act is carried out, his hands are, in effect, tied behind his back. He can do nothing in the face of the sworn statement that the child is in attendance at another school. There has been no desire on the part of the parents of that child that he should attend any school -- a fact that is 
<page:147>
urgent in complaining of the obstacles that are placed in his way. Sir, I think-and I say it almost with bated breath, and almost with trepidation-it is time that our education sys- tem was reviewed from the top to the bottom. We have in the past been superstitious over it, up to the point of worshipping it almost as a fetish. We Canterbury men above all others are proud of it, because it originated with the Canterbury men of the past. There is no doubt of that. It is one of the boons Canterbury has bestowed on the other portions of the colony ; but it has now become somewhat impaired by the lapse of time, and it is distinctly behind the age. It may have been right enough in 1876 or 1877, but it is a quarter of a century behind in 1901 ; and when this House can lay aside all prejudices, and can calmly and dis- passionately view the machinery, of our educa- tion system from the beginning to the end and put it on a sound genuine footing-a footing that will last another twenty five or thirty years in its revised form -- the House will deserve well of the community and of the people of New Zealand. Mr. BUDDO (Kaiapoi) .-- Sir, I do not agree with the honourable member for Avon with re- gard to any great alteration in our educational system, though adjustment may be beneficial, but still I have a considerable amount of sym- pathy with him when he speaks of the bad attendance of the children at the public schools. It is a very great pity indeed that the efforts the State has made to overtake the truancy that  exists in our midst should not be better backed up by all concerned. I confess that the Magis- trates are to some extent handicapped by the reasons that have been mentioned by the honourable member for Avon. A sympathetic feeling on the part of the Magistrates towards those parents who, for many reasons, may be unable to send their children to school is, per- haps, a commendable fault, and I think the honourable member for Palmerston has to a considerable extent provided a further means to prevent the non-attendance of the children at our public schools. I see the Education Board of North Canterbury has just recently passed a resolution stating that fourteen years should be the age of exemption for our children at our public schools, and I observe that the member for Palmerston says fifteen years in his Bill. Perhaps this may unduly handicap a boy who has to learn a trade or work for a livelihood ; but, if the parent has not allowed his child to attend school sufficiently to enable him or her to pass the Fifth Standard of education, he should, if he is in a position to do so, be forced by the law to allow his child to attend school until the Fifth Standard is passed or the age of fourteen is reached. It is, I think, a reasonable deduction to be drawn from our educational system. One of the principal reasons given for non-attendance is illness on the part of the child, and it is almost impossible for the Truant Officers to prove that illness has not been present in some particular reasons, such as that some of the older children are required to attend to the younger children while the parent is absent at work, and thus add to the means of livelihood of the family ; that excuse always receives attention, and in cases of the kind Justices of the Peace are lenient. Other parents take a pardonable pride 11.0. in having their children well dressed, and if they cannot be so they are not sent to school. In most cases, however, it is ignorance and pure neglect on the part of parents to give any attention whatever to the education of their children. One other reason. I think. why parents have been lax in attending to the Truant Officer's orders is that the fines have been too low, and that perhaps weeks and months of inquiry have elapsed before they have been imposed. Even then, if the fines were double they would not have been enough. If a parent has been negligent in respect to the education of his children he should be fined as much as his means will permit of, and the Magistrate can, as a rule, easily ascertain his position. The Bill provides that a fine not ex- ceeding 92 shall be imposed, and, if it were not too drastic in some cases, it is almost a pity that a minimum sum is not fixed in the Bill. Mr. PIRANI .-- That is in cases where they do not send their children at all. Mr. BUDDO .-- That is so, and it is one of the blots of our educational system. If honourable members will try to put this Bill into shape in Committee-and there are many good points in it -- they will do a good service to the system. The Hon. the Minister for Public Works has just intimated that its provisions may be incor- porated in a general measure, and I may add that the member who passes a measure giving further power to our Education Boards to compel the attendance of children at school whose parents are negligent of their education will be deserving of the thanks of the community for doing so. Mr. CARROLL (Native Minister) .--. I have a few words to say in regard to this measure. have no objection to it ; in fact, speaking broadly, I am in favour of the trend of its pro- visions, and any exceptions that one may take may be made in Committee. I am with the honourable gentleman in reference to the com- pulsory attendance of Native children, but would hardly countenance the extreme length to which this Bill goes. That some departure is necessary goes without saving, because I have witnessed, with a great deal of pain, the great laxity shown by Native parents in the education of their children. It seems to me that some system is wanted under which Natives will not exactly be forced to send their children to school, but which will offer them every facility for doing so. It is absolutely necessary that they should reap the advantages of our education system. The time has now arrived when every ounce of knowledge im- parted to the Native children will be of incal- culable benefit to them. I do not say that the regulations in respect to attendance of Native children should be on the same drastic lines as 
<page:148>
in the case of Natives. Generally speaking, I am in favour of compulsory attendance on their part, having due regard to the peculiar circum- stances with which they are surrounded. I would give power to the Minister of Education to work through the Committees of the dis- tricts on some rational plan to secure the attendance of Native children. I will be pre- pared to support the clauses under an amended form. I agree with my colleague that, as the Government have already a Bill on this subject introduced, we could absorb therein all the good clauses of this Bill. Mr. BARCLAY (Dunedin City). - It is with very great pleasure that I rise to support this measure. At an early stage of this session I placed a question upon the Order Paper asking the Government " If they will intro- duce a Bill this session to amend the law relating to the prevention of truancy from schools ?" and the Hon. the Minister who acts as Minister of Education in this House gave an answer in the affirmative. It is to be hoped that the two Bills will not clash ; but, at all events, there can be no harm in passing, as the Minister himself has suggested, the second reading of this Bill at the present time. and some arrangement as to the two Bills can probably be come to later. That this Bill is required is a fact that has been pointed out by the Education Board of the Otago District for some years, and with special and particular emphasis in the last annual report, the report for the year ending 31st March. 1901. I do not propose to go into questions which are more properly dealt with in Committee as to details of this Bill. I believe that the honourable member in charge has embodied in it a great many suggestions which have been made by the     Otago Board, so that it will, I trust, not be neces- sary to offer any very serious criticism when the Bill goes into Committee. I should like to say a word in regard to what the honourable mem- ber for Avon said in respect to private schools. It seems to me that the difficulty of a child attending a private school, and making that an excuse for not attending regularly, might be got over by making the provisions of the Truancy Act apply to attendance at private schools just as well as to the public schools. The honourable member for Avon also referred to the system which is in force in some places of conveying children to school by arrangement amongst the country settlers, or by arrangement with the Education Board. In South Canter- bury, for instance, there are several cases in which the Board pays for the convevance of children to school. That system is found to answer admirably. It is economical, and saves the expense, for some time at least, of build- ing and staffing new schools. I desire to con- gratulate the honourable gentleman on having introduced a Bill which is very much needed, and which will have my support and assistance, and, as far as I can judge, the support and assistance of nearly the whole House, in taking it through its various readings. Mr. Carroll ing of this Bill have favourably commented upon its provisions, and I concur in what has been said, and compliment the honourable mem- ber for Palmerston. There are many useful pro- visions in it, but, inasmuch as those provisions have been referred to by previous speakers, I will not occupy the time of the House by fur- ther referring to them. I would like, however. to correct a mistake made. The honourable member for Avon, in referring to the original Act of 1877, said that that Act was drawn up on the basis of the system which obtained in Canterbury prior to the abolition of the pro- vinces. That was not so. It was based on the system of education that obtained in the Provin- cial District of Nelson. Nelson was considered to be in advance of every provincial district of the colony upon the question of education. I recollect the time when the Bill of 1877 was drawn up under the supervision of the Hon. Mr. C. C. Bowen, of another place. Now, Sir. in reference to irregular attendance of children whose parents place so little value on the free education afforded by the State to the children in this colony, I am of opinion that any parent neglecting to see that his children gets the benefit of free education is committing a serious offence against the State, and I think it would be wrong to be lenient out of respect to the feelings of such parents. When the North Canterbury Education Board had under con- sideration the appointment of a Truant Officer I strongly recommended that the offer made by the Justice Department, that the police should be available to the Education Boards of the colony to act as Truant Officers, should be accepted. I venture to say that one visit of a policeman to a neglectful parent would have more effect than half a dozen visits of a Truant Officer. As to hurting the feelings of parents, that does not come into the ques- tion at all, because they are not entitled to consideration. I say the sooner we abandon this idea, and utilise the Police Force of the colony, and insist upon those children who do not attend school attending regularly and thus fitting them to discharge the functions of citizenship. the better. There is another por- tion of the Bill that I approve of, and that is that this compulsion of children shall extend to private schools as well as Government schools. 1 recollect that one of our Magistrates in Canterbury drew my attention to a case of neglect on the part of a parent in the education of a girl that was brought before him. This girl was some sixteen years of age, and had committed an offence, and \- when called upon to sign her name she could not do so. It came out that when the Truant Officer went to the house of the parent of this girl he was told that she was attending a denominational school ; and the Truant Otheer. taking for granted that the statement was cor- rect, went away and took no further action in the matter. As a matter of fact, that girl was attending no school at all. So far as this Bill goes in the direction of compelling all to attend \- 
<page:149>
An Hon. MEMBER .- Under the existing law they must get a certificate of exemption. Mr. MEREDITH .- That is true, under the Act ; but there are many ways of evading the question and of getting out of the difficulty. It would not be wise to raise the school age from five to seven. I would leave the age at five. I have no objection to extending it to fourteen years. At the present time it is confined to thirteen years, and I would be prepared to extend it to fourteen years. I think there are good objections to the raising of the age to seven and extending it to fifteen. Our children who commence attending school at five years enter into the kindergarten department of our large schools, where they gather ideas during the first year or two of their school life, upon which foundation they raise a most useful superstructure in future years. Therefore I do not think we need interfere with that. I will support the second reading of the Bill. Mr. T. MACKENZIE (Waihemo). - As a member of an Education Board, I wish to say a word in connection with this Bill. The honourable gentleman has suggested that the age should be retained at five. It appears to me that the first duty is to make the children physically strong, and if honourable members saw, as we saw when going round with the Teachers' Salaries Commission, the number of very small children congregating in the large schools, it would be evident to them that they were far too young to be confined for such long hours in a school-building. For my part, I think the mover of the Bill is wise in making it seven. I do not think that any real progress is made by placing children below that early age at school, and I think seven   is a quite early enough age to send them to school. It enables them to become physi- cally strong, and then afterwards they have greater power of acquiring and assimilating knowledge than if their school training started at an earlier age. The question of school at- tendance is a most important one, and I con- gratulate the honourable gentleman upon bring- ing in his Bill. The fact is that education is placed too easily within the reach of all, and the consequence is that many people quite fail to appreciate its blessings. If they had to pay something for it they would take much greater care to see that their children availed them- selves of all its advantages. Of course, I have not the slightest intention of suggesting that anything like a charge should be imposed, but I cannot help thinking that there are many parents who are not esteeming as they ought to the advantages that they possess in enjoying one of the greatest blessings that any country can have-the free education of its children. There is another point in connection with this matter, and that is this: that children should be required to go to the school in their own school district. It is a very serious matter in this colony. Teachers may in carrying out their work properly offend some very sensitive parents, and they have the power now to and sending them to other schools that may be a little further away. I think that in amending the Education Act the opportunity should be taken to make provision that child- ren should attend the schools in their own school district. Of course, there is the larger question of the driving to school opened up, and we should make a definite stand with re- spect to it. I shall support the second reading of the Bill. Mr. WITHEFORD (Auckland City) .-- Just as Christchurch initiated education, so Palmers- ton North has perfected the system, and, irre- spective of party sides, I am pleased to hear so many kind references to the member for Palmerston. As we are all interested in the passing of this Bill, I do not see the necessity of prolonging the discussion myself, and I hope, therefore, we shall proceed at once to agree to the second reading. Mr. COLLINS (Christchurch City) .- Like the honourable gentleman who has just sat down, I intend to support this Bill ; but, in spite of the observations he has made, I think there are just one or two points in connection with the matter before the House that should be fought out. With the honourable member for Avon, I fully recognise the fact that there is nothing in the work done by Justices of the Peace which gives cause for greater pain or more bitter disappoint- ment in connection with our education system than these matters of truancy. But there is one point that has struck other members as it has struck me-and a painful point it is too -- and that is the gross ignorance which many, if not most, of the parents of the truant children themselves manifest when they are brought into Court. It is one of the most pitiable and painful facts that comes under one's notice that there should be such a large proportion of the parents of the colony who still fail to appreciate what is due to their children and what is due to the State in seeing that their children are taking advantage of the free education provided for them. The par- ticular point I wish to call attention to in con- nection with this matter is this: Where the parents come before the Court they very fre- quently display the grossest ignorance as to the provisions of the law itself, and I think the schedule which contains the form of notice to be served on the parent by the Truant Officer should be of the simplest possible character. It should simply set out, in plain terms, the parent's duty so far as the child's attendance at school is concerned, and draw unmistakable attention to the penalty imposed on the parent for failing to fulfil that duty. And if this is done in plain and unmistakable language, so that even the most ignorant person can under- stand, it would have the desired effect. As a rule, a sheet of blue paper is handed in by the Truant Officer, and I think, equally as a rule, that paper is not read, and, if read, is not understood. And I think, Sir, it would be infinitely better if a notice of a much simpler character was drawn up for the Truant Officer to serve on the parents 
<page:150>
Personally, I have a great objection-and I think the objection is of a serious character-to the parents of children being dragged to the Magis- trate's Court. I hope the time is not far off when we shall do as is done in other places --- namely, institute educational Courts where these cases may be adjudicated upon. From every point of view it is bad that parents of children should be dragged to the Police Court. Honour- able members who, like myself. have frequently adjudicated upon such cases know that perhaps from twenty to thirty parents come into Court, where all kinds of cases are being heard, and they have to stand about the Court waiting for their cases to be called on, and they thus become Most of those familiarised with the Court. parents have a wholesome dread of the Court, and I think that wholesome dread ought to be main- tained, if possible. But when they are brought into the Police Court, even if it is only on account of a truancy case, that wholesome dread is apt to be lessened, if not altogether destroyed. I think that matter is worthy of the serious attention of the Government : and I hope the Government will see its way, in con- nection with our educational system, to intro- duce some mode of dealing with these cases so as to avoid dragging parents before the Police Court. I would like, also, to support the con- tention of the member for Kaiapoi, who sug- gested that it is necessary to increase in some cases the fine at present imposed in connection with truancy cases. Justices have now to impose a fine of 2s. where such breaches of the law are proved. I admit that a fine of 2s. may  be a heavy enough fine in many cases, but there are cases where the parents are wilfully neglect- ful, and where they absolutely fail to realise their responsibilities as parents and their duties as citizens of the State; and I think that in such cases it should be left to the discretion of the Justices to inflict a heavier fine if they I shall cordially support deem it necessary. the Bill, and I sincerely hope it will receive the assent of the House. Mr. HASELDEN (Patea) .- I shall oppose this Bill, for three reasons-first, for the reason given by the member for Palmerston with re- ference to increasing the distance to four miles. Take the case of a child that has to travel four miles to a school and four miles back to his home. That means about an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half each way-say, three hours a day. Then, there are four hours of education in the school. That makes seven hours. Then, there are perhaps two hours for milking in country districts, which makes nine hours, and at least one hour for home lessons. We prevent a working - man from working more than eight hours a day, yet child- ren are made to work practically ten hours a day. Then, I ask, what is the use of com- pelling a child to learn the population of such a town, for instance, as Timbuctoo? How does that help that child in the future, when his work is perhaps bushfelling or Mr. Collins That is the position that a child, when it has grown up to manhood or womanhood, would be placed in. There are many ways of looking at I remember an old story which education. illustrates what I mean, and I dare say most. honourable members have heard it. A vessel was wrecked, and a sailor, a university pro- fessor, and a business man were cast off in an open boat. The sailor said to the professor, " You had better be captain : you are the best man here, and you ought to be the boss." "But," said the professor, "I know nothing about the management of a boat." The busi- ness man, when appealed to, made the same rejoinder. The sailor replied, " Well, you are a pair of duffers." So, of course, the drunken sailor had to take over the control, because he was the best-educated man there. That, Sir, is my idea of education. In the olden days the Maori was the educated man in this country. He knew how to get his living. He knew how to overtake and capture the moa. He knew how to fight his enemy. We do not want to raise a lot of weak and sickly children by a system of cram, and a system of passing which is equally bad. Under the present system the schoolmaster crams the children in order that he may place a certain number of passes to the credit of his school, and the consequence is the children are overworked, because in the agricul- tural districts the children must help their parents with the milking, and so on. Where a boy or girl is endowed with great talents, I believe such children should have every advantage- they should be sent to the higher schools, and thence to college; but to attempt to stuff and cram the ordinary child with book-learning only must be injurious to the health of the child in every possible way. Then, I would not raise the standard of education any higher than the Fourth Standard, nor would I raise the age above thirteen years. Hon. MEMBERS .- Oh ! Mr. HASELDEN .-- I say, if a boy desires to learn anything after that he can do so without staving at school ; but if they have to earn their living with their hands, as I have had to earn mine, they do not require to be crammed with Latin and Greek. If a child of tender age is to be compelled to go four miles to school, then the Government should find means of conveyance The children of poor parents have not horses or ponies to ride. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City). --- Sir, when listening to the honourable member for Patea I wondered to myself whether I was living in the Georgian era. It is very refreshing some- times to hear antediluvian opinions resurrected for the benefit of the modern democracy. Need- less to say, I differ absolutely from almost every syllable the honourable gentleman uttered. The only safety of the democracy is that its people shall be educated, and I think it is rather late in the day for any one to get up in a British Parliament such as this and to say that the education of the people should be restricted to 
<page:151>
unless exceptional ability were displayed. An Hon. MEMBER .-- He did not say that. Mr. NAPIER .- The honourable gentleman asked, as I understood, what good it would be to a young man who had not the career of a university professor or suchlike before him, but who had to go out into the bush and earn his living, to have a good education. I contend that, no matter what sphere of life a man may occupy, a good education is no burden, but a great blessing. It will enable him to do his work much better than he could if his mental faculties were untrained. Knowledge is power. " Seck wisdom," said the ancient sophist, '. while you are young : it will be the sole consolation of your old age, and the only good of which ill fortune cannot deprive you." The Bill is one which I heartily support. There has been great laxity in the matter of school attendance, and, if this Bill will have the effect of compelling negligent parents to send their children to the schools of the colony, I believe we shall have done a good evening's work in passing it to-night. The question of physical education is one that should not be neglected, and I believe that seven years of age is as low a limit as ought to be allowed in the Bill at which children should be sent to school. There is a great deal of complaint in the country with regard to the purely literary character of the instruction given in our schools, and in so far as the honourable member's remarks may have been directed to that view of the question -- though he did not make his meaning very clear -- I would concur with him. I believe there should be more manual training and more physical education. 1 should like our educa- tion system to approximate more to the Belgian or German systems, in which greater attention is paid to the physical education of the children, and also to manual dexterity. I do not mean by "manual training" only technical instrue- tion in various arts, but such as there is in the Swiss common-school system. I shall give my cordial support to the Bill. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin). - I cannot allow the honourable member for Auckland City to mis- represent what was stated by the honourable member for Patea. The honourable member for Auckland City made it appear that the member for Patea proposed to restrict educa- tion to the Fourth Standard. He said nothing of the sort. What he said was that education should only be compulsory up to the Fourth Standard ; he did not propose to restrict it in any way. I do not say I agree with the opinion expressed by the honourable member for Patea, but that is what he said. I agree with most that has been said by previous speakers with regard to the necessity for a School Attendance Act, and I admit that this Bill remedies many of the defects of the existing law - particularly the defeet with regard to the attendance of children whose names are not on any school- roll in the colony. It is impossible to get at such children by the Act of 1894, and this | remedies that defect. But in some respects I | speakers, I feel a hearty sympathy with every- to children between the ages of seven and fifteen years who are living within a radius of four miles from a school. Well, imagine a child of seven years of age being compelled to walk eight miles a day, to and from school, on four days in the week. Mr. PIRANI .- There is power to exempt. Mr. MASSEY .- Yes, there is power to ex- empt ; but this fact remains : that it is provided in the Bill that any child over seven, as long as he or she is in good health and is living within four miles of a school, must attend such school on at least four days in the week. Then, with regard to exemptions, it provides that they may be granted by the Committee. That, I think, implies, at a properly convened meeting of the Committee- An Hon. MEMBER .- The teacher may exempt. Mr. MASSEY .- Yes; but I should say the teacher is hardly the proper person to grant ex- emptions, because, unfortunately, this teacher's salary depends to a certain extent upon the at- tendance being kept up. I would suggest that, besides the School Committee and the head- teacher, exemptions should be granted by the Chairman and Secretary. Mr. PIRANI. - That is provided. Mr. MASSEY .- That may be what the honourable gentleman means, but the Bill does not say so. It says, " Any child desiring an exemption may apply for and receive a cer- tificate from the School Committee of the dis- trict, under the hand of the Chairman or Se- cretary thereof." I take that to mean that applications for exemption must be considered by the Committee. What I was going to sug- gest was that it might be made possible for a parent to go to the Chairman or Secretary, without waiting for a meeting of the Com- mittee, and receive an exemption ; if that is meant, I agree with it. But the great difficulty in connection with the School Attendance Act has been referred to by the honourable member for Christchurch City (Mr. Collins), and con- sists in the ignorance of the parents with regard to the School Attendance Act. They do not understand the law, and you cannot get them to understand it. I would suggest that a synopsis of the Act should be sent to every householder in the colony. An Hon. MEMBER .- Let it be done by the Truant Officers. Mr. MASSEY .- I do not think that by the Truant Officer is the proper means to dissemi- nate such information ; besides, we have not got Truant Officers in every district in the colony. I do not propose to oppose the second reading, because I agree with the main provi- sions. We require a School Attendance Act which will insure a reasonable attendance on the part of pupils, but which will not entail any more hardship than is necessary on either parents or children. Mr. MONK (Waitemata). - Like previous 
<page:152>
exemption from the privileges of education. But before making any further remarks I would like to ask the Native Minister how he expects to bring the Natives under the provisions of this Bill, and to enforce its provisions in respect to them. How can he compel them to pay the fines ? He knows that in most cases they have strong objections to the payment of fines, and have not the means of doing so, and therefore I want the House to realise the danger of pass- ing a drastic measure such as this, which may be intolerable to the Natives, who are not pre- paired for such exemplary pressure. It is the great characteristic of the Native to move spas- modically. As soon as you take any action deal- ing with them -- perhaps specially for their ad- vantage-they will take at first a very active interest in the movement, but in a very short while they become tired of. it, and ! education compelling a teacher to cram ap to relapse into a period of absolute relaxation | fourteen or fifteen years of age. The Fourth or indifference. I am speaking now of the adults, but the same characteristic applies to the children, who in many cases soon tire of going to school, and the parents have not got that control over them which is necessary to compel their attendance; in fact, discipline is not carried out to that extent by the Natives which is necessary to enforce that regularity of attendance which this Bill is presumed to se- cure. I hope nobody will misunderstand me, for there is no one in this House who is more zealous and stronger in his desire that a very perfect system of education should be secured to New Zealand. Particularly as a democracy  is this necessary. I think this reason is ap- parent to most minds: that if we are to be in truth a democracy-if that form of government is to rule in this country successfully-it re- quires education ; and no other form of govern- ment can equal it in which there is not that demand for individual fitness by culture in the units composing the communities that possess it. Without such fitness there can be no suc- cessful democracy. I am one of those who believe that up to the present moment the teachings of history are that democracies con- trolled, like ours, by the mere volition of public will have proved in the long-run a failure. There is no instance of a democracy ruled by the voice of the masses in which popular greed and selfishness did not bring about national decay, excepting in Helvetia. Taking the human heart as it is, we can only reach, so to speak. a certain quality of de- mocracy in which. for endurance, there must always be a strong element of conservatism : With that was stated by Aristotle ages ago. regard to the enforcement of an education system, I wish to commend to some extent the remarks made by the honourable member for Patea. I say that we are not reaching a per- feet system of education, because we are trying to secure equality of results in the scholars with a feverish pressure of a weights curricu- ! lum. as if all would alike receive and assimilate i of fine weather ; and I believe, with the honour- it with beneficial results to the State. We able member for Franklin, that it will be the Mr. Moni: teacher has to enforce is to estimate that every child has a perfect capacity, say, up to thirty gallons, and is capable of being the recipient of thirty gallons. Children, the same as adults, vary from a very low ca- pacity to qualifications for the very highest degree of attainment. We want a system of education which shall be more tentative that when children reach up to a certain age you should try and ground them thoroughly in the educational status which they are fitted to receive, and which will best qualify them for the battle of life. That is the secret of good education. And when you reach up to a certain age those children who are fitted to go in for higher educational attainments shall be selected, and they shall be placed in special classes. But there should be no system of Standard thoroughly grounded in the child- ren will be far better than the achievements of the Sixth Standard under cramming that they may not be able to assimilate. How many, I wonder, of the successful and able men, taking the community of New Zealand as a whole, could have passed the Sixth Standard with credit. Not, Sir, but what they may possess, so far as practical abilities are con- cerned, a very high degree of education. I wonder what proportion of scholars there are who, when they leave school, are conscious that their school has been but the imparting to them of the machinery or the keys with which to unlock for themselves further stores of knowledge, and to feel the aspiration for know- ledge and information that will last throughout their lives. But perhaps seven children out of ten, the moment they leave school, are thankful they are leaving behind all the discipline and knowledge which the teacher attempted to impose on them, and they for the rest of their lives have a dislike to that mental effort which, could they have been well edacated, would have made them feel that for them the acquisition of knowledge had only commeneed - had only been initiated -- when they left school. Now, Sir, with regard to the starting-point of education : Seven years for country dis- tricts is too late. I feel that the honour- able member, in dictating this Bill, has had regard for children in the cities-the child- ren who are only a short distance from the schools. But surely the honourable momler can have very little familiarity with country life. Of course. Palmerston is a very thickly- populated district, though a country district : but let him go away up North, and he will find there children struggling from five to six miles in order to get to school. Mr. PIRANI .- They are provided for. Mr. MONK .- - I cannot find where there is any provision in this Bill for children who can do such long distances only during periods 
<page:153>
to do so. I hope, when the Bill comes before the Committee, that members will not put in any drastic imposition in regard to the fines. I hope that there will be a feeling of con- sideration for parents; and we should have that feeling of consideration. I can well sympathize with the statements made by the honourable member for Avon, that there is nothing more painful than to have parents dragged up before Justices of the Peace, and ignominy inflicted upon them, for the purpose of fining them for not enforcing the attendance of their children at school. Let honourable members remember that very largely throughout the country there is great difficulty in making provision for getting to school - I am speaking, of course, of scattered districts of which I have knowledge. This Bill will do well enough for city districts, but, at the same time, even in cities a great many people are subject to fines when they are scarcely in a condition to force their children to attend school. Vice may be the factor, but there are some instances where the mothers are not what they ought to be, and other instances where the fathers are often in a continual state of depres- sion and need ; and then to drag them up before Justices of the Peace and impose a fine upon them (as suggested by the honourable member for Kaiapoi, with a minimum to be fixed) is a proposition which I hope this House will not assent to. I hope this Bill, while its aspira- tions are in the right direction, will have some consideration for the unfavourable conditions  existing in many parts of the country over which it will have to operate. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) .- While I join with those members who congratulate the member for Palmerston on the introduction of this Bill, I feel bound to draw attention to what I may call a surprising anomaly. On the one hand there is a floating, an indefinite, belief that the Education Act of 1877 is a sacred thing that must not be touched. On the other hand, we have introduced into this Parliament session after session Bills to amend and alter that very same Act. These Bills are passed into law. And so we find spread all over the statute law of the colony Bills amending the Act of 1877, in regard to which, as I have said, there is such a fervent belief that it is a thing that ought not to be altered or amended. Sir, all the remarks I have to make will circle round clause 4, which is the pith of the Bill. This clause savs,- "Subject to the provisions of the principal Act, every child between the age of seven years and the age of fifteen years is hereby required to attend some public school." Now, the member for Ashley has already put his finger on one crucial point in that clause, and I am sure he will insist that the word " seven " shall be altered to " five." On that particular point I differ from the honourable gentleman. He holds that the age should re- main as prescribed in section 83 of the original Act. which says : - from the last preceding birthday." Of course, any person who understands the subject sees at once that the honourable gentle- man's objection to the seven years is based on the fact that if the word "seven " is retained in the clause the Education Boards would lose the capitation on all children between the ages of tive and seven. Personally, I indorse the view taken by the honourable gentleman who drafted the Bill. I think, with Garfield and Lincoln, that children ought not to be sent to school before seven years of age. Before that age the mind is unfitted-it is not sufficiently matured -- to undergo study such as would benetit the man in after-life. We have the infant prodigy and the bright example of the kindergarten ; but can any person who has studied the question say what becomes of the infant prodigy in after-life? Few ever reach a strong mental maturity. Coming more closely to the question debated this evening, the whole principle of the Bill is, I take it, directed to the truant or truancy system. Now, I never saw a finer example of an enthusiastic desire on the part of an Education Board to meet that truancy difficulty than was once attempted by the Auckland Education Board. When I occu- pied the position of Minister of Education I visited all the schools in and around the neigh- bourhood of Auckland, and I never saw a finer example of what I may call the missionary spirit than in the conduct of their truant school. Their truancy officers gathered all the street-arabs of the city-urchins without boots or socks, ragged clothing - and took them to the truancy school. It was crammed full of children of that age or status-or want of status, I should rather say -- in society. It was a perfect picture of the ragged school. Mr. MONK. --- Did you not leave anything about it ? Mr. FISHER .- At the time I wrote a short paper upon the subject, commending the laud- able efforts of the Auckland Education Board, and I did so because I knew of no similar at- tempt having been made in any other part of the colony. I also prepared the paper E .- 1c, 1888, " Statement relative to Amount expended upon School Buildings since the Coming into Operation of . The Education Act, 1877.'" The following sentence was part of the introduc- tion to the report :-- " The following tables have been prepared ex- pressly to demonstrate the exact basis upon which our education system rests, speaking of the system only in relation to the number of children to be educated, and the future finan- cial provision necessary to be made for provid- ing building.accommodation for all children of school age.' Pardon the coo: I wish it to be understood that I prepared this paper wholly myself; for I have lived to be told that every paper of mine was prepared by the officers of my de- partment- - that I knew nothing of the subject. and was therefore not competent to prepare my own papers. The assumption appears to 
<page:154>
" So that the actual number of children not known to be attending any school is 26,258. But, in referring to this 26,258, care must be taken to guard against the assumption that 26,258 children remain neglected in the edu- cational sense, or that they have never received any education. In analysing this total, two elements come into play. First has to be con- sidered the number of children whose parents object to send them to school before they have reached the age of six or seven. It would be difficult to estimate the number of these child- ren. The number, of course, is an indetermi- nate number, but it should be understood that, whatever the number, they are included in the 26,258. Next has to be taken into account the very large number of children who, having passed the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Standards, leave the public schools from the age of eleven and upwards, having probably received all the school education they will ever receive. The number of these can be estimated. For in- stance, last year (vadie Education Report, 1887), out of a total of 12,302 children who were pre- paring for the Fourth Standard (12.5 being the average age at which the standard is passed), 3,523 either left the public schools finally, or continued in the class preparing for such stan- dard." I now come to the point at which I come into conflict with the honourable gentleman's views as expressed in clause 4 of his Bill :- " It is a fact that the great bulk of the child- ren of the working-classes leave school at about that age " -- that is to say, about the age of eleven and upwards -"themselves to go to work." My paper proceeds :-- "To a close observer, then, it will become #cc-zero apparent that in the Registrar-General's figures the same 3,523 children who left school at the Fourth Standard, as just stated, v ill be made to do duty for possibly three, but certainly for at least two, succeeding years amongst the 'not accounted for ; "" The Registrar - General told me afterwards that in making up the statistical returns for the colony he experienced great difficulty in discovering the whereabouts of this residuum of the children who were not attending school ; but through these investigations, I found where these children were, for which I again say, as others say for me, ego. He thanked me. " - for, leaving school at twelve and a half years, they will be classed as 'not at school ' at thirteen, so at fourteen, and possibly so at fifteen, the fact being that they have finished their school-days although they are still within the range of school-age (five to fifteen). And the same process a ill take place in regard to a number of children of other standards who finish their education (all they will get) and leave school before they reach fifteen, and are consequently returned by the Registrar-General as being within the school-age, but are ' not accounted for' because they are not in actual attend. nee at school." Mr. Fisher Committee to decide upon whatever age-limit it pleases. The object of the Bill is, it seems, to compulsorily force parents to send their children to school from the age of seven until they are fifteen, and that, I hold, would be a hardship upon a large section of the working- classes of this colony who take their children from school at eleven or twelve, in order that they may assist in maintaining the family. From the opinion I have so strongly expressed in this paper it may be taken for granted that I will endeavour to prevail upon the Committee to reduce the age from fifteen to fourteen, and possibly to thirteen. As for the word " seven " I shall feel bound, in accordance with my con- viction of long standing, to vote with the honourable gentleman if he insists upon its retention, although it may to some extent cripple the resources of the Education Boards. I vote in that direction for the reason that I believe it will strengthen, instead of weaken, the mental powers of the children of this country. Now, Sir, I have a complaint to make, and I will endeavour to express it in the most impassioned way. That complaint is that I believe there will never be a complete remodelling of the Education Act, and conse- quently of the education system, until we have a Government in office-I ask the Government not to take this as a personal reflection upon themselves . I say we never can have a com- plete remodelling of the education system until we have on these benches a Government with sufficient courage to attack this question in the way in which it ought to be attacked. There is in the minds of the Government a dread of the Education Boards. An Hon. MEMBER. -- Why should there be ? Mr. FISHER .- The honourable gentleman need not put that question to me. I prepared and submitted to the House a Bill which would have sent the Education Boards to the right- about, and have put an end to their existence. But, as I have said before in this House. the Government does not exist which dare face that question in that way. I say the Education Boards are an exerescence upon the system, and until the educational affairs of the country are administered from one head we never shall have anything like a national system. Mr. MONK. - Centralisation. Mr. FISHER .- Call it what you will, I say that would strengthen, not weaken, the educa- tion system of the country. The existing sys- tem has no more ardent admirer, no stronger supporter than myself. Any person who has heard me speak upon the subject during the past decade must surely understand by this time what my feelings upon this question are, and I say there must be a virile, animate, and active feeling in the Government itself which will forge it ahead, with strength sufficient to break down any barrier that stands in the way of advancement and improvement. As I have said, I prepared a Bill, "The Public Schools Bill," which, while it proposed to abolish the 
<page:155>
tive body which would be a substantial and workable substitute for the Education Boards and the existing School Committees. I ask any man whether it is sensible or reasonable to maintain in existence two bodies to per- form duties which can more satisfactorily be performed by one. Two bodies must necessarily be much more expensive than one. And I appeal to those members in 12.0. Parliament, and to those gentlemen out of Parliament, who complain of the exces. sive cost of the education system to tell me why the redundant body should not be elimin- ated from the system. If they say the Educa- tion Boards and the School Committees should remain in existence as at present established, how then can they logically complain of the excessive cost of the system? Sir, I say the duty devolves upon the Government to give us a lead and to take its proper stand upon this vital question. It is the highest question to which any member of this Legislature can devote his attention. It is a question to which the Government ought to devote its closest attention. I hold that the education system of this country will never be perfect and strong as it ought to be until the Government itself seizes upon the subject with a determination to do what I am convinced in my own mind can be done-namely, to alter, strengthen, and improve the system in the manner laid down in my Public Schools Bill, which has now been before the country for ten years past. That is a sys- tem that would make more perfect the educa- tion of the youth of the colony and at much  less cost. But, as I say, it is a question the Government fear to touch. I get the credit in connection with this, as with other questions, of "belling the cat "; but I aspire to some more valuable recognition than that. I know that my Public Schools Bill struck terror into the Education Boards of the colony. They feared their dissolution ; but I say, as I said on the first day 1 introduced that Bill to this House, that the abolition of the Education Boards is the first thing to be done before it becomes possible to make any important im- provement in the education system itself. I do not want to labour that point, but I say that under the administration of the Education Boards the education system is simply drifting along as best it may. There are in qualities that ought to be rectified. I often ask myself if an intelligent visitor were passing through this country, and he saw the unequal manner in which the education funds were distributed to the Education Boards through the Educa- tion Department in Wellington, whether he would not say, " How is it that this district is living in comparative affluence, with magni- ficent school-buildings and highly paid teaching staffs, while these other districts are literally financially starved ? " That is literally the case; and what must be the effect upon the pupils in the starvation districts ? The visitor cannot avoid the conclusion that it is a piebald system. There are Education Boards in the they do not know how to employ, while there are education districts in the North Island which do not know where the money is to come from for the erection of schools in their districts. I will mention the names of some of the poorer districts, although it is not necessary to give the names of the affluent dis- tricts. The poorer districts are Taranaki, Wa- nganui, Marlborough, Westland, and Grey. 1 am not here to cast reflections upon any mem- ber of this House, or upon any Minister of the Crown, but I am here to say this : that if there were a Minister of Education with the courage to exercise his prerogatives in the way those prerogatives ought to be exercised it would be impossible that there could be rich districts in one part of the colony and poor districts in other parts. If the pupils in all parts of the colony are to receive equal education, the Boards should receive equal finance-that is to say, each should receive sufficient for its actual needs. There should be no such thing as plenty on the one hand and actual poverty on the other. I was once Minister of Education. I may be again pardoned for referring to that, though it usually creates a laugh in that part of the House where the member for Palmerston sits. But the honourable gentleman is not laughing to- night. Mr. PIRANI .- It is no laughing matter. Mr. FISHER .- Well, Sir, when I was Minis- ter of Education I did this: I took the total education vote. I ascertained for myself by diligent inquiry which of the education dis- tricts of the colony were in most straitened circumstances, and, instead of distributing the vote by rule-of-thumb, as it was distributed before and has been distributed since my time, and as it is being distributed now, I found out which of the districts were most in need of money for the erection of schools for the educa- tion of the youth of those particular districts. Mr. PIRANI .- You mean the building fund. Mr. FISHER. - Particularly building. 1 built a school at Blenheim, which I believe is a credit to the district. I rebuilt one at Hokitika-one which was burned down-when the honourable gentleman who is now Premier of the colony came to me along with Mr. Joseph Grimmond to ask for an increased grant to build a school which would meet the requirements of the future. I built a school in the congested Clyde Quay district, Wellington. I gave increased grants to New Plymouth and Wanganui. I distributed the money placed at my disposal according to the best of my judgment, and I say that that method of distributing the colonial education vote ought to be adopted to-day, to-morrow, and for all time. There ought to be no poverty- stricken districts, and no rich districts receiv- ing more money than they can legitimately spend. This state of things ought to be changed. Perhaps I have spoken forcibly, but I have spoken as dispassionately as I could, and without the least desire to make any charge against this Government. But I say that the ad- 
<page:156>
ment ought to be held with a tighter grip. There ought to be some more powerful control at the head of affairs. There ought to be a complete abolition of this rule-of-thumb system. The education system ought not to be allowed to drift at the sweet will of the Education Boards. That sums up all that I have to say on the subject. I want to see a firmer grip held by the Minister of Education, and an attempt made to model the system on the plan of my Public Schools Bill, which is as perfect as human ingenuity can make it. That Bill has met with the approval of the deepest thinkers on the subject in this colony, and I again express the hope that I may live to see it become the law of the land I now come back to where I started, and close with this remark : We see a want of direction from the educational head, and from the Ministry, the Government of the day. We see this continual tinkering with the Education Act, and so, in- stead of finding that the Education Act is a sacred thing that must not be touched, here we are, year after year, monding and botching it, and scattering amending Acts broadcast over the statute-book of the colony. May this state of things soon be brought to a conclusion through the efforts of some great man of commanding intellect. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton) .- I have listened with very great interest to the speech that has just been delivered. and to a number of the other speeches that preceded it. I shall confine my own remarks entirely to one point. in connection with this debate. I regretted to hear not only from the member who has just sat down, but from a number of others, re- marks that seemed to suggest that they are in favour of raising the school-age from five to seven. Now, Sir, I do not know, neither can I tell exactly at the present time, whether clause 4 of this Bill is intended to raise the school-age to seven. Mr. PIRANI .- It does not alter the existing law. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .-- But I notice, while the school-age is five years, the honourable gentleman provides in this Bill that they shall not be compelled to attend unless they are seven years of age. Mr. PIRANI .-- That is the present law. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .-- Judging from the remarks that have been made by honourable members during this debate, it appears to me that there is a strong feeling in the House that the school-age itself should be raised to seven. Hon. MEMBERS. - No. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL. -- I do not think honourable gentlemen who say " No " heard the speeches and the remarks to which I am rofer- ring. I am referring not merely to the speeches made, but to remarks which honourable mem- bers made during the delivery of those speeches, and I say if there is any attempt made in this House to raise the school-age from five to seven years, it will be met with the utmost hostility Jfr. Fisher years, are to a very large extent mistaken. I have had the opinion of some of the ablest school- masters in New Zealand upon this question, and they have informed me-and I have no doubt they are correct, and from my experience as a parent I can indorse their opinion - that if children are not brought under control in schools until they are seven years of age, in many cases it is almost impossible to " break them in," if I may use that term. Honourable members will understand the sense in which I use the word. The real effect is this: that while no sensible man-particularly no parent -would advocate that the full strain of mental work should be placed upon children at the age of five years, it is most important for the future well-being of children that they should be brought under discipline at an early age - sav. five years, learning physical drill. the simple subjects, and generally on kindergarten lines. I may say, if I may intrude upon the House personal matters, so far as my own family is concerned, that we have discriminated as to the individual child. In some cases, we have not sent children to school -- not even to learn their letters until they were seven years of age, and. in other cases, we have been glad to send the child to school at the age of five, feeling sure only good could result. I understand that the school-age is from five to fourteen wars, and 1 shall always stand up against anything that may result in the school-age being lowered. The member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) spoke just now from the point of view of the finances of the Education Boards, and it would be a very serious thing, so far as the Boards are concerned. if they were to lose the capitation grant on children who are between the ages of five and seven years. An Hon. MEMBER .- That is where the shoe pinches. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL. - 1 do not know what the honourable gentleman means by saying "that is where the shoe pinches " ; but I am sure that if capitation were not paid to Educa- tion Boards for those children who attend schools between the age of five and seven years, the result would be to seriously affect the finan- cial position of the Boards, and to necessitate their being assisted in other directions. The teachers' salaries, of course, would suffer, and vet at the present time we have a Commission engaged in the task of finding some method by which the salaries of the teachers may be in- creased. As I have said, I merely rose to enter my protest against any proposal to raise the school-age, and if I thought this Bill would go in that direction I would give it uncompro- mising hostility. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston) .- In reply, I de- sire to thank members for the kindly way in which they have treated this Bill. Mr. FISHER .- Including me ? Mr. PIRANI. - Yo, including the member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) who, when he speaks on education. generally treats the matter

the Government to go further in the direction of amending the Education Act, because I think that the discussions which take place in this House which are the most instructive and freest from party influence are those that deal with education.

Training-ships-Referendum BlII. The Hon. the SPEAKER took the chair at half- past two o'clock. PRAYERS. TRAINING-SHIPS. ADJOURNED DEBATE. The Hon. Mr. MONTGOMERY .-- I under- stand that the object of the motion is to obtain the establishment of a training-ship for boys of good character, rather than a reformatory. . I would not vote for the establishment of a training-ship as a reformatory, because I hold the opinion that a reformatory is better man- aged ashore. But as the intention which my   respected friend the Hon. Mr. Jennings has in view is a training-ship for boys of good character who want to qualify themselves as seamen, and as the Legislature has twice ex-     pressed itself in favour of it, I think it should I consider the Government be given effect to. should now proceed to take action in this matter, with a view of carrying out the wishes of the Legislature. As I said before, I shall vote for the motion for the reasons I have indicated ; but I would not vote for it if the training-ship were for anything else than for lads of good character, and was in any sense a reformatory for boys who had committed a crime and had been in the hands of the police. The Hon. Mr. REEVES .- I am very sorry, Sir, that the honourable gentleman who has just sat down takes such a narrow view of the matter. If a boy in his early youth has com- mitted some petty crime and is committed to a training-ship, the opportunity of acquiring a training for a seafaring occupation should not be debarred to him. Many a hoy has been led into temptation at an early age, and has after- wards turned out, through proper training and looking after, to be a good man ; and I trust that such a thing will not influence the Govern- ment, if they do intend to establish a training- xhip, to preclude boys who have committed some offence from being admitted to it. Yes- terday, I think it was, or it may have been the' day before, the Hon. the Minister who is leading shore. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER. -- I said there was no reason why it should not be. The Hon. Mr. REEVES. - I misunderstood him, then. There is a wonderful difference be- tween training on board ship and training on land. I think there is no reason why a certain discretion should not be used. At all events, an institution on land would no doubt be produc- tive of much good ; but not one of them can compare, for the training of youths, with a training on board ship. They are subjected there to better discipline, they are woll looked after, they are carefully trained, and they ob- tain all the exercise that they need, and every- thing is calculated to bring out good and true men in the long-run. This thing has been tried not only in New South Wales. but we know it, has been tried in the Mother-country to a very large extent, and any one who likes to read up the subject will find that immense benefits arise from training-ships in the Old Country. Those benefits are almost incalculable. Boys have gone in there who have perhaps been led into crime, in- asmuch as they have been committed for some petty offence, and those boys, in scores of in- stances, when they reach the age of fourteen or fifteen, turn out to be really good and useful boys in the Royal navy. I am sorry my honourable friend the Minister of Education made the remark that no boy who had been tainted with crime could be admitted into the Royal navy. If that is the case-and I cannot contradict the honourable gentleman's statement - it seems to me to be a very drastic measure ; because, as I have already mentioned, a boy who happens to be committed to a training-ship for some venal offence should not be debarred from taking his position in the world afterwards. Most honour- able members who have spoken are quite in accord with the motion of the Hon. Mr. Jen- nings, and I personally have always been so. When I was a member of another place, I always expressed myself in favour of the esta- blishment of a training-ship in the colony, and I think the time has now come when we must go into the matter seriously. New Zealand eventually will be a great maritime nation. as our insular position places us pretty well in the same position as Great Britain, and the time is coming when we shall be a great sea-going people. I trust the Government will take the matter up ; and I am surprised beyond measure that, with an enlightened Government such as we have now, a Government that is in the van of progress. they have not already taken the initi- ative in regard to this very important question. I trust the feeling of this Council and of the other House will be so strongly marked this session that the Government will see their way clear to establish such an institution. As the Hon. Mr. Jennings has said, there is no doubt the Home Government would be only too glad to turn over some of their old obsolete ships to the New Zealand Government at a very small price, if anything at all, because it must be recognised, as it is now recognised in the Old

sailing-vessel or steamer coming here ? Will you find all British sailors on board ? No; you will generally find that many of them are foreigners, and it behoves us as a young nation to look after ourselves in the future. I do not intend to detain the Council with any further re- marks on the subject, but I shall support, as far as I can, the honourable gentleman's motion. The Hon. Mr. BOLT .- Sir. this is a very important subject to my mind, and, I believe, to the minds generally of members of the Council. Now, the Hon. the Minister has asked, If you could get such good results from training on board a ship, why not get the same results on shore ? I think honourable members will see, as my honourable friend who preceded me pointed out, that the conditions are quite different. On board a ship a boy naturally takes to habits of order, cleanliness, industry, and a sense of freedom accompanies all his actions, which is not the case on shore. The life of a boy in such an institution on shore is rather monotonous ; but a boy on board a ship cultivates not only those feelings I have mentioned, but he cultivates a cheerful respect for those in authority over him. He feels he belongs to a seafaring race, and the traditions of that race have become established in him, and he unconsciously takes part in the history of the people of that race. That, I think, is perhaps the main thing which distinguishes this training from training on shore. Again, Sir, in regard to training on board a ship, we know very well that people who have been  inured to a seafaring life have the greatest en- joyment wherever there is a slight element of danger. One never has any real enjoyment unless there is some small element of danger. #cc-zero and although one would scarcely say there was danger on a training-ship, vet when a boy is on anything afloat it brings that sense to his mind. He has a sense of freedom also, and if there is an element of danger it gives him a spirit of enterprise and initiative which cannot be brought out in shore life. Now, with regard to what has been said on the question of turning out sailors, I do not think this training will bring out good sailors -- I mean the sailor of the old school, such as the Hon. Mr. Scot- land alluded to vesterday. The truth is we shall never see that sailor again. He is an extinct species, belonging to a different class of seafaring life. The sailor of the present day does not live the same life that the old sailor did. He has not got to lie aloft furling clouds of flying canvas over his head. He has not the same resource. He relies purely upon the machinery in the engine- room, and that machinery to a great extent has undermined the character of the old sailor. But, while it is doing that, it is making a class of sailor which we can to a great extent improve by training of this sort. The training which now goes on in training-ships goes a long way, I contend, in the direction of making a sailor such as is required at the pre- Hon. Mr. Reeves was said yesterday : that the necessity for this kind of training-ship is the result of our past legislation, and that had it not been for our labour legislation we should not have required this training-ship at all. I do not think we should have this thrown in our faces, that in consequence of our past legislation contingencies like this have arisen. In every country where there is labour legislation, or where there is none, you must provide for contingencies such as this. The question is, Can we, if we have these training-ships, turn out stronger boys and more honourable and better men than we can by a shore training ? I think we can. The Hon. Mr. FELDWICK .- I think there is one thing that requires to be alluded to before we come to a decision on this subject. A "red-herring " has been drawn across the scent, not -intentionally probably, but accident- ally. This is owing to the fact that, when the honourable gentleman who was the parent of the motion two years ago had a Committee set up, and evidence was taken from a captain in the Royal navy, his evidence was led in such a way that he was induced to believe that what we wanted to have was a ship to be a school for the navy. This created a great complication. A large section of the members of the Council merely wish to see the boys trained for the sea, and the navy is no con- sideration whatever. The captain informed us that if we had a training-ship, and if any of the boys among the inmates of that ship had any criminal taint upon them, no one trained on the ship would be admissible into the Royal navy - that is to say, that they would start with a bad mark for life. This com- plication ought to be got rid of. Let us have a training - ship for the mercantile marine, and leave the Royal navy entirely out of the question. This is the view I take on the subject. It is very awkward for Parliament to deal with a question where there is any kind of complication. We do not want a ship for training for the navy; we want a ship on which boys shall be trained as sailors, and we should prefer that, after their training, if possible, they should take to land pursuits -- ! be the "handy man " on shore. That is the case with the boys trained on the "Sobraon," of Sydney, of which we have heard so much. A ship like that would suit us, and attached to it a sea-going craft. on which, as the Hon. Mr. Bolt said, the hovs could now and then go and face "the dangers of the sea "-go on "active service." so to speak. I think it is most desir- able, and I really do think a resolution like this ought not to have been necessary at present. 1 believe such a ship ought to have been esta- blished many years ago. It has been a very mistaken policy that it was not done. The boys who are at present in our industrial schools -otherwise, "reformatories," for they are re- formatories in this country-take Caversham or Burnham for instance - are badly branded through some of them having been more or less mixed up with criminal children-children who 
<page:159>
the boys would be far better on a training-ship ; for when a boy comes off a training-chip we all know that among British people a sailor is wel- comed everywhere -- every one is favourable to the sailor boy. Therefore I think it would be a great deal better that we should be without these land institutions, and have a training-ship in- stead. I intend most cordially to support the motion, and I am very pleased with the honour- able gentleman's persistence year after year ; and I do not regret the time that has been devoted to this discussion in the Council, because it has attracted and must attract attention in the country. The Hon. Mr. TWOMEY .- Sir, if the Order Paper were bigger I should not have taken up the time of the Council, as I do not profess to have any special knowledge on this subject, but there is one point that has been raised on which I wish to express an opinion. This point was raised by the Hon. Mr. Montgomery. I can understand the honourable gentleman's desire to maintain the high reputation of the British sailor ; he has. I understand, occupied a dis- tinguished position in the mercantile marine himself at one time, and consequently may be : pardoned if he has a partiality for that pro- fession. But J. think, like the Hon. Mr. Reeves, he is taking a very narrow view of it, and I was astonished to find that the British navy would not allow into the service any boy who had any taint of criminality. I do not know, ' when we look back at the British sailor, that ! he is of such an extraordinarily exemplary character that we need be so timid about the admission of a person who may be guilty of a very innocent and harmless trick in his early youth. 1 do not think he would suffer by that. { cording to the statement of the Hon. Colonel There is a great difference between people: there are two classes of people-people who are found out, and people who are not. These children may be in their early age guilty of a little in- discretion which their after conduct might well atone for, and I do not see that they should be ! branded for ever because they happened to do some little thing of a criminal character, pro- bably very innocently. That is the point I wished to speak on. While I do not think I would go altogether so far as the Hon. Mr. Feldwick, I do not think these ships should be shut altogether to persons who have been guilty of indiscretions. I, of course, have no know- ledge on this subiect. but I realise that a good work would be done by training these boys to a means of earning a livelihood. I think, too, that the assertion that the necessity for these training-ships is traceable to our legislation is a rather extravagant statement. I think it is altogether contrary to fact. I have a distinct recollection of a time previous to the introduc- tion of this legislation, and if such a statement had been made then, having regard to the con- dition of the workers at that time, it might be · said that something of the kind was necessary to provide for the unemployed in those days. At the time every street-corner was constituted a meeting-place for the unemployed. Our destitution from end to end of the land. Now the position has changed, and you might travel for miles, and days, without meeting a swagger. You would not iind one, and you do not hear of an " unemployed" meeting. Every- body has plenty of employment -- in fact, it is difficult to find workers; and that is the change that has come about contemporaneously with the currency of those laws which the honour- able gentleman deprecated, and which he said resulted in a training-ship becoming a neces- sity. I do not think that the honourable gentleman could support that statement by any system of reasoning, and I do not think it is capable of being substantiated by a single fact. What I state is the absolute truth as it is pre- sented to us now by our social conditions, and I think the honourable gentleman made a mis- take in making the statement, which anybody can see is at variance with facts. The Hon. Mr. FELDWICK. -- I would like to say, as a matter of personal explanation, that I did not state that children of criminal taint should not be admitted to a training- ship, but that we should have only the one object in view, irrespective of training boys for the Royal navy-that of training them to a sea life. The Hon. Mr. GOURLEY .- I have a mis- understanding on this question. If the motion is to establish a training-ship such as has been described by the Hon. Mr. Jennings-namely, the "Sobraon," which is moored in Sydney Harbour -- then I am opposed to it, because I consider that that ship is nothing more nor less than what the Minister of Education said vesterday-a floating prison. Then, ac- Pitt, these boys are taught the goose - step, 1 to know how to stand at ease, to touch their hats to their officers, to wheel to their right and left, and otherwise to do what they : are told ; but they have no freedom of action. The only good thing I see about that ship is that she has a schoolmaster on board, and that is the only good thing about it. Just imagine for one minute a vessel moored in Sydney Har- bour, which is one of the prettiest harbours in the world, and those children are cooped up on board that vessel, and can only look at their beautiful surroundings, while they know that other children of their own age are allowed some freedom of action for at least two or three hours in the day for the ordinary recreation which youth requires. Does anybody tell me that such a ship is the place for young children ? I say, No; and I say again that the industrial school on land is far better than a floating prison. If you want to establish a training- ship pure and simple I am with you -- that is, if it is to be a ship to train boys for the sea, as I understood from the Minister of Education yesterday that that was his idea. That is all right, and by all means have a training-ship, and provide that no boy on board shall be under fourteen years of age, and keep him there until he is sixteen, by which time. if he gets & 
<page:160>
fit to take a position on a vessel and be em- ployed by any shipping company in the world. That is the sort of ship I would vote for, but not for a floating prison. Some speakers in this debate have referred to the fact that boys guilty of petty larceny would not be allowed on board a man-of war. I come from a place called Belfast, which is surrounded by beautiful gardens, and I venture to say that if those gardens could speak they could tell tales that would make some men ashamed of themselves for talking so much about petty larceny. What is petty.larceny ? One boy goes along the street and he sees some apples in a garden. There is not the least necessity for him to steal those apples because he has plenty at home; but the apples tempt him -they have tempted others before him. Yet that boy is let off with a caution, because his parents are respectable. The other boy, as he walks along the street, and perhaps has not had a good meal for weeks, sees a loaf of bread in a shop-window. That tempts him ; and I say he has more justification for his larceny than the boy who takes the apples. Yet he is convicted of petty larceny, and branded for all time; and if we keep these boys out of the public service I say that the punishment is too severe for the offence. I say by all means have a training-ship pure and simple, but I agree with the Minister of Educa- tion that, in regard to such a thing as the "Sobraon," we should have none of it. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER. - I would like to say a few words in order to clear up one point. The point I referred to in connec- tion with the "Sobraon," and which has also been referred to by other speakers in the course of this debate, was as to the eligibility of boys from a ship like that to get into the navy. It is a very important point, because if they are eligible, then, of course, one advantage possibly to be derived from a training-ship is clear. have here the evidence which was submitted to the Committee of the Council a few years ago. When Captain Leah. of the " Mildura," was being examined he was asked by the Chairman this question :-- " Under any conditions whatever do you take boys from reformatory ships, such as, for in- stance, the . Sobraon,' in Sydney ?. No; we take no boys unless they bear a thoroughly good character." Then I asked these questions :-- " You say that, as far as the navy is con- corned, boys are not taken from reformatory ships : that is an actual fact, is it ? - Yes. " Are you acquainted with the different kinds of training-ships at Home - I mean in the Old Country? No: i am only acquainted with our own. " How many have you, more than one ?. .. Yes ; four or tive. " And they take the boys, do they ?--- The boys are recruited by recruiting parties. These Hon. Mr. Gourley where about the ages of fourteen or fifteen. " Only boys of a thoroughly good character, of course ?---- Yes. "And their training then commences ?- Yes ; the boys go through a training course of from eighteen months to two years in a training- ship. " And that is the way Her Majesty's ships are manned ?- Yes: very few are taken from the merchant service. " In addition to these training ships there are others, like the 'Worcester': do you know anything of that class? - No, nothing whatever ; they are purely for the merchant service. " With regard to reformatory ships : do you know anything of that class ? No, nothing. " Do you know anything of the ' Sobraon ' in Sydney ?--- >o." Then, the Inspector-General of Schools gave evidence to the effect that "the navy is prac- tically closed to reformatory or industrial- school boys, though it is open to boys who have been trained for bands." Then, here is the report of the Inspector of Reformatory and Industrial Schools of Great Britain, for the year 1896. He states, -- "The fact that the boys from industrial- school ships -- except band boys -- though not excluded from the navy, are not welcomed there because of their antecedents a serious matter, for it means that the most powerful stimulus to stir the imagination of a boy on one of the industrial training-ships-namely, the hope of one day entering the Royal navy, which is to boys the highest embodiment of sea life is of small avail." And in a letter to the Minister, which was copied in 1836 but was written in 1-95. in reply to a letter from the master of the Burnham School, Captain Baker, of H.M.S. " Katoomba," said that " no boys could be received on board Her Majesty's ships from establishments of a reformatory nature." I do not think I need go further, but I have shown that I was quite within the mark when I stated that the boys from the "Sobraon " would not be welcomed into the Royal navy. There is only one other remark that I desire to be permitted to make, and that is that I should feel obliged if the honourable gentleman would agree to strike out the word " unanimous " from his motion. do not think it is altogether a fair way of putting a resolution to this Council, because, although there may not have been a division upon the question, yet it does not follow by any means that the vote was unanimous. For instance as far as I can remember, although I did not support the honourable gentleman's resolution last year, I had so much sympathy with his object and aim that I did not in any shape or form force the matter to a vote. I allowed the matter to go on the voices, and I do not think I should afterwards be brought into it by having the word " unanimous " put into a motion of this kind. I will not divide the Council on this 
<page:161>
shell be obliged if the honourable gentleman will strike out the word " un nimbus." Tho Hon. Mr. JENNINGS. - I am quite willing that the word should be withdrawn. The Hon. Mr. T. KELLY .- I may say that I am placed in a difficulty with regard to this. do not think it has at all be on unanimous. The Hon. Mr. JENNINGS. -- I have just stated that I am willing that the word " unani- mais " should be exeised. The Hon. Mr. T. KELLY. - Of course, it is a very desirable thing, if we could by any posible means effect it, that the lads who are inclined for a serfaring life should get the necessary training for it. Bot. Sir, the difficulty at present is that, although there is a great do mand for boys in the country districts, it is impossible to get them to leave the towns, and therefore I would ask, What boys are we to put in the training-ships ? Are they to be the boys who are sent there by the Magistrates, or are they to be volunteers. Then, I ask again, Whatt is to be the age for admission ? I do not think that any boy under the age of sixteen years is fit to go to sea in a training-ship. Well, then, boys who are sixteen years of age will get far better wages on shore than they can possibly get on any ship or stenner or training-vessel, and they would be far better treated. In any case, the life on a coasting boat is a very wretched one, and unless the boys prefer a seafaring life to a life on shore, then I do not think the training-chips as now con- ducted are of any use to the boys who wish to adopt the sea as a life work. Now, supposing that there is a training-vessel, as my honourable friend suggested, which is simply to be anchored in the harbour, how are the boys, under such cirounistances, to have the opportunity of ob- taining the training that will make them efi- cient sailors? I contend that they cannot be taught seamanship under such conditions, and that the only way to make them good sailors, and be taught practical seamanship, is to send them on a vovage. That is the proper training for sailors, to my mind, and in the absence of such training I fear my honourable friend's aspirations will not be realised. I do not object. at all to the establishment of a training-ship for boys, either as sailors or in any other way, but I think we will not get the boys to volunteer for these ships. I quite agree that boys should not have a stigma attached to them because they may have committed some offence which huis brought them into the hands of the police and before the Court. I think these boys ought to have another chance in life when they have committed some minor offence, and that thev should not be treated through life as criminals. I am afraid that this training ship will not re dise all the anticipations of my honourable friend. The Hon. Mr. PINKERTON .- Most of this debate has turned on the question of boys ; but, Sir, boys become men after the lapse of a few years, and we have to consider this matter from that point of view as well. I quite agree VOL. CXVII .- 10. should be the thing. I also would like to say that, because a boy may have stolen an apple or a piece of bread, it would be unjust to have him branded as a criminal, and not allowed to earn his own living at sea or anywhere else. Of 1 course, we cannot after the rules of the British navy, but surely it is a very hard thing that, because some unfortunate bey may have been badly brought up and got a sentence for some minor offence, he cannot enter the British navy, no matter how exemplary a youth he may turn out to be. I say such a thing would be very absurd. and if the law is as has been stated, then the sooner it is altered the better. There is one thing I wish to point out, and that is this: Boys, in the natural order of things, become men in a very few years. Supposing, then, a boy. no matter how he has got into the training-ship. becomes a respectable man and leads an entirely respectable life, why should he not be allowed to join the Navy ? Ho is a man, and is doing well, and surdy there is nothing that should prevent that man joining a ship because at some time of his life he had a little black mark against his name. If a lad goes on board a training-ship, and receives there the advantage of the valuable training which I understand the Hon. Mr. Jennings has in view, and is able afterwards to take his part in the British navy, or in the mercantile marine, or in any other way, there should, and I presume there will, be nothing to prevent him joining any ship. But the argument has been, seem- ingly, that these lads must be drafted from the training-ship to the navy, and that because a lad has a little black mark against his name, according to the evidence of some, he must not be taken there-that he is on a prison-ship, as the Hon. Mr. Gourley said, and therefore must not be allowed to join the navy. Now, I think that it is altogether a mistake, as I have said before, that because a young lad has stolen an apple he should be branded all his life as a criminal. He may become a very good man- and these lads very often become good men- and as such they would have all the privileges of citizenship. The Hon. Mr. JENNINGS .-- Sir, a few minutes will suffice me for reply, and I shall deal with some of the objections raised by my honourable friend Mr. Scotland first. A ques- tion has been raised about boys of criminal taint not being admitted to the navy. I never urged that they should be : I endeavoured to prove to honourable members that many boys in industrial homes were neglected children, truants, and absconders from work, but they were not criminals. Why, no less a personage than Captain Cook, who is revered as one of the world's greatest navigators, has been instanced by the Hon. Mr. Scotland as one who had run away from home, and was a sort of ab-conder. The Hon. Mr. BOWEN. - . Not an absconder. The Hon. Mr. JENNINGS .- Well, he ran away ; he shipped without the permission of his family. Sir, if any boy in this country were to do the same thing the chances are that he 
<page:162>
be put in one of the industrial homes. Now, in regard to the question of petty larceny, and so forth, which has been imported into this debate, is there one honourable gentleman in this Council who at one time or another in boyhood's happy days has not been guilty of pilfering an apple or some other fruit, for which under the laws of the country he might have been convicted of petty larceny ? I am really astonished that the question of petty larceny by immature boys should have been trotted out in this Council to-day. In regard to the Kohi- marama training-schooner, which the Hon. Mr. Scotland referred to. Sir, that training- schooner, though mismanaged, and though irregularities occurred-not altogether solely on the part of the boys-was productive of a large amount of good. Here is a return presented to the Government, signed by Mr. W. T. Glasgow, showing that, out of sixty-five boys placed on that schooner, no less than thirty-eight were apprenticed to the sea. And, Sir, when I was recently in Auckland one of those boys, now a bearded manly fellow, came up to me and said, " Mr. Jennings, I hope you will go on with that training-ship proposal. My experience of the Kohimarama training was such that all of us boys who took to the sea are in fairly good posi- tions. I myself am in command of a large vessel "-giving me the name. That is one instance of the good that has been done by the training received on such a vessel as I advo- cate, and it is worth all the boxing about the compass that has taken place here to-day.  Another point raised is : Are the opportuni- ties sufficient to enable the boys to follow a seafaring pursuit in New Zealand at the present time? I shall give a statement made by Captain Allman, who at the time was attached to the Marine Department :- # " Marine Department, Wellington, 14th October, 1895. "It has been urged that the effect of this measure [the Shipping and Seamen's Act] is to shut out from all chance of following a sea- faring life the many young lads who, in a country having the large seaboard of New Zealand, naturally have an inclination to follow this calling, and that in consequence our mercantile marine now and in the future must inevitably be manned solely by 'foreign' labour-that is, by men who do not claim New Zealand as their home. The contention is, undoubtedly, a sound one, and would be serious to cause concern were there no way out of the difficulty." His way out of the difficulty was that each ship should be obliged by law to carry a certain number of apprentices according to the ton- nage ; but at present our shipmasters and ship- owners have no inducement to carry lads in addition to the number of able seamen they are compelled by New Zealand law to carry. He further says, - "Unless some action is taken, therefore, a scafaring career must be beyond all boys who Hon. Mr. Jennings Captain Allman's suggested solution was that the Government should pay a bonus of $12 per head for every lad carried by the master or owner of any ship registered or owned in New Zealand. There is the opinion of a captain who was attached to the Marine Department of this colony, bearing out what has been said here, that the opportunities presented to our boys of following the sea are extremely limited. Sir, in regard to the question raised by the Hon. the Minister as to why there should not be equal advantages in the training of boys in shore institu ions as compared with that on a training-ship, as I said last year, a boy is full of ideals, he is full of freedom, and is con- stantly wondering what this world is, and what it all means. He wishes to wander abroad, and, finding the daily routine work in the shore institutions too dull for him, he becomes dissatisfied, and the very first opportunity he has he "clears out "; and it is then that he gets into trouble, as he has to suffer additional confinement and harder terms, because of his running away. On the other hand, a boy on a training-ship has more varied occupation. If a training-ship was in Welling- ton, for instance, he could go about the harbour, across to Day's Bay with the other boys in the ship's boats, under proper control ; he could indulge in agricultural or gardening pursuits as taste so dictated ; he could go in for fishing. Further, the boys have to go through their drill. All these things, with their own band, and wearing of a uniform, tend to turn the boy's mind in a direction that makes him a think- ing and useful boy, amenable to discipline and obedience, and therefore better able to go through life and its stern battling. I have received a letter from Major Loveday, and, with the permission of the Council, I shall read portions of it which bear on the teaching of the boys, and I shall ask that the whole of the letter be published in Hansard. The letter is from Captain Mason, the gentleman who has produced such marvellous results on the reformatory training-ship " Sobraon " :- "Nautical Ship 'Sobraon,' Sydney, N.S. W. " Major Loveday, Wellington, N.Z. " MANY thanks for Hansard containing such an interesting account of your Council's de- bate upon the training-ship project. When- ever you can have a talk with that level- headed member the Hon. Jennings, M.L.C., do not fail to impress upon him that he could not render the rising generation of his fellow-colonists a more far- reaching and permanent benefit than by bringing about the inauguration of a training-ship for young- sters such as I deal with. All members of our community benefit by catching and curing the budding criminal young. Let him make no mistake about a ship, when the super- vision is thorough, being far preferable to even a semi-marine shore institution. There need be no jealousy about where the ship is anchored ; that should be Wellington, which holds the

adjunct (which I have for years fought for here, and not yet got) -viz .. a small square-rigged brig or schooner - would regularly visit all your fine ports in turn. Let me have reasonable freedom in framing and starting your system, and I will not only guarantee its success by promise, but I will lodge $1,000, to be forfeited towards expense incurred, if I fail at the end of, sav, three years to satisfy an impartially con- structed committee. "I have not spent twenty-five years in daily hard work, living for but one object - that of elevating the condition applying to neglected youngsters -- without knowing my subject thoroughly. I like the work and know its value. If your people, after satisfying them- selves of my ability to help them, care to avail themselves of my services. I am not only will- ing to serve them, but, as I stated before, will, as far as my limited means permit, give tangible evidence of my confidence in my undertaking. "W. H. MASON." It makes one's heart glad to read how these thousands of waifs and strays have been enabled by this humanising agency to attain to pro- sperous and honourable positions in the world. Now, as to the question of the admissibility of boys to the Royal navy, will any reasonable honourable member of this Council for one moment say that there are boys who have been at one time in their life in a reformatory training-ship, not a criminal reformatory ship, precluded from getting into the Royal navy ? An Hon. MEMBER. - I do not think so. The Hon. Mr. JENNINGS. - I have it on the authority of a naval officer, who, I may say with all deference, is quite as good an authority on such matters as the honourable gentleman. " Why," he said, " in times of war do you think if a young man came along with all the necessary physical powers and good health, and proved qualifications as a seaman, he would be excluded because he had been in one of those institutions which are not criminal ? It would be absurd. Some of the best men I have seen were men who have been in a little bit. of trouble in their younger days." And, Sir, the history of every regiment will tell you that there are men in those regiments-some of the best men in the army- who at one time or another. if their career was searched, would possibly have come under the ban of excom- munication that is set up by some honourable members in this Council, and would not have been able to get in either the army or navy. In regard to this marine reformatory vessel, if honourable gentlemen had closely followed me yesterday they would have learned that I would not put in any boys who were criminally tainted. Those who are found to be badly tainted with crime, perhaps through heredity, should be kept in an industrial home on shore. But as to a boy who merely for refractory con- duct, for a little bit of larrikinism, or for not following his duties as an apprentice, or being a neglected child without any taint of criminality -those are the boys I would put on a training ship, and they could be drafted from the larger and discipline. I would then transfer them to the auxiliary schooner, which would go about our ports from time to time, and they would thereby learn practical seamanship. I have come across men in the Taranaki Province who have been trained as seamen. They have this advantage over the shore-trained youngster : they soon become very handy men ; they can do anything on a farm. Hon. MEMBERS. NO. The Hon. Mr. JENNINGS .- Well, then, they can do a lot on a farm ; they are handier than a great many in my own trade, for instance. Our products, such as butter, cheese, wool, and frozen meat, will always be in demand in the Mother-land ; we have more than we can con- sume, and our surplusage we are willing to sell to those beyond our was. Sir, we are twelve hundred miles from any other point of land ; we have all the natural advantages to make our people attached to the sea for transporting our great products. It is unwise on our part, with these advantages, not to endeavour to train our boys in the direction indicated by my motion. If carried out, the historian of the future may be able to say that New Zealand forms the maritime Power of Australasia. 1 thank honour- able members for the very kind manner in which they have accepted and supported my motion, and I trust, sooner or later, success will attend the efforts of those who believe like myself, that a training-ship should be established in New Zealand. The Hon. Mr. BOWEN .- With the permis- sion of the Council, I should like to explain a little matter that has been referred to once or twice during this debate. I do not want honour- able members to run away with the idea that Captain Cook, of whom we are all so proud, went to sea because he got into any trouble ashore. I have just turned up a notice of his life in the National Biographical Dictionary, and it will be seen that not only this was not the case, but that he did not run away to sea. I quote the words of this authority :- "He was, at the age of twelve, bound ap- prentice to the shopkeeper at Staithes, a fishing village about ten miles north of Whitby. After some disagreement with his master his inden- tures were cancelled, and he was bound anew to Messrs. Walker, shipowners, of Whitby, with whom he served for several years in the New- castle, Norway, and Baltic trades." Motion agreed to. # REFERENDUM BILL. ADJOURNED DEBATE. The Hon. the SPEAKER was understood to say that the honourable gentleman who moved the adjournment (the Hon. Mr. W. C. Walker) had forfeited his right of reply. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- My reading of the Standing Orders is that I can speak either now or later on. I am, of course, not so familiar with the Standing Orders as you, Sir, because as a rule we are not contentious in the Council. I can only state from my experience in another place, if an honourable member 
<page:164>
done it frequently -his right of speaking at a subsequent stage of the debate is never chel- langed. So I citim my right to speak at any period of the debate, though I don & device to exercise it at this moment. I hope you will rude so, Sir. The Hon. the SPEAKER. - The honourable gentleman has the right to speak now if he plats. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER. - But at no other thne? I should like to know whether you rule that I am within my rights in either speaking now or later on if I think fit? The Hon. the SPEAKER .-- The honourable gentleman has the right to speak now. I have no doubt that if he wishes to speak later on the Council will not object. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER. - 1 do not wish to ask a favour of the Council ; I wish to ask an interpretation of the Standing Orders. I can only saw what I know it to be in another place. No member forfeits the right to speak because of having moved the adjouoment, and not speaking on the resumption of the debate. The lion. Mr. McLEAN .- That is, if his motion for the adjourninont is carried. The Hon. the SPEAKER .- I did not rule thit. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER. - I hope you will not imagine that in any shape or form I de- sired to raise a contention- question, because in the samo way, I think, as you have challenged ine von might have challenged in honourable mem- bor who is not in his place, I regret to say, owing to ill health. He moved the adjourn- ment of the debate on the first occasion : he has been laid up since, and if he had recovered and had been able to take his place in the Council     his right to speak would also have been chal- longed : and I contond, with all respect to you. Sir, that whatever may have been the custom in this Council, and whatever the ruling in the past, the rights of members who move the adjournmont of a debate are undoubted. The Hon. Mr. Mecan drew attention with perfect accuracy to the one saving clause. that if an honourable gentleman moves the adjourn- ment and his motion is not carried he undbabtedly loses his right to speak again in .the debate. That is a rule, I think, abso- lutely sound. But as to the member who carries the motion for adjournment, it remains entirely with him as to whether he chooses to spark on the resumption of the debate or not. If he does not choose to speak and the debate continues he can speak when he chooses without any challenge from the Chair. And for this I claimed my privilege. As to this Bill. I am sorry that either my exposition of it when I moved the second reading was not sufficiently exhaustive, or ele I presumed too mach on the fact that honourable members would have been sufficiently acquainted with the mind of the country on the subject, and would therefore be up as much to date as insself and the Government on this matter. I may have erred, perhaps, on the side of taking too much for granted, but I maintain that it is Hon. Mr. W. C. Walker ma'ter. There is no une treating it as a matter which is not to be considered and dealt with, because it has been dealt with in a live way in other countries at the person time, and also it involves the question that this country has already adopted the principle in certandly one vory notable instance, the question as to the alcoholic liquor trade. An Hon. Meysen. - - That is local option. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER. - Call it local option or what you like, bat the principle of that Act, referring it by referendum to the people, has been accepted with relief by the general mind of the country : that on a certain day every three years the publie mind should speak on a subject on which no individual him- self can come to a conein-ion, on which no Government can absolutely come to a con- clusion, but in regard to which at one par- ticular time the great voice of the electors in every part of the country should be prepared to say whether they wish that system to con- tinne for the next triennial period. If this is not the referendinn I do not know what it is. And how long has that principle been in force in this country? And as long as it has been in force, who have objected to it? I know some pothouse politicians - the word " pothouse " does not convey exactly what I mean -I meant to say, small-minded politicians- - An Hon. MEMBER .-- Pigmy politicians. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER. - Piany politicians object to it because they think that the loe di-option vote very often exringaishes the attention that ought to be paid to them, and to their claims on the electoral eve and ear. They say that two issues in the one day are placed before the electors, to the detriment of a candidate, who should be the cynosure of all eyes on the occasion. Well, I say that that man only says that because he is too small- minded to see that it is an advantage that the electors can vote at one time on more than one subject. He ought to be only too glad to think that his perfections can be measured without the disturbing element of whether it is to be " beer or no beer." This I consider one of the most beneficial enactin ats we ever passed - the fact that this vote can be taken in such a way as to eliminate the question of personality from politics, and also that the vote must be taken on such a day that you will get a con- vineing " Ave" or " No." I would not for anything in the world alter the provision of the Mesholic Liquors Sale Centrol Act which preseribos the day on which that vote is to be taken; and any one who votes to change the poll from that day. I think, would be com- mitting a grave error, as I am persuaded that the action of that referendum has ben most salutary and in the interests of every one. I concond. Sir. also th it there are other questions which might very well be submitted in the same way to the popular vote. I mentioned one when I was moving the second reading ; but there are others which are not policy questions - which are very often social questions - and side issues which do not enter into publie usefulness : and, as far 
<page:165>
views on such questions have very often been supported at the poll simply because of the general usefulness of their carcer, in spite of the unpopular side which they have taken on some of these particular questions. But rather than that these questions should be put in front of the public, especially at election times - rather than that they should be traps to the unwary yomig politician when he is trying to cut his eve-teeth :- I would sooner see them dealt with in a straightforward way, and let the people say whether they want anything of the mature to which Ihave referred. Most of them are questions to which " Ave " or " No " can be given. Take the Bible-reading-in-schools ques- tion: Does any one say that every elector in the colony does not know what that means, or that he is not prepared to say " Ave " er " No" on that question ? Well. I say there is a matter which might very well be referred to the electors of the colony, if the question is of the import- ance which some people seem to think it is. I have no doubt in my own mind that it was settled once and for all when the Education Act was passed in 1877, and I am not afraid of the question being brought up in any shape or form, now or afterwards. But I know this: that there are certain parts of the colony where the public mind is being disturbed by the con- stant reiteration of the ery that " we must have the Bible in schools " An Hon. MEMBER ... . That is a different thing to a poil. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- I hope the honourable gentleman will not be in a burry. That is one question. I will deal with that question as well. I wish to state the one thing first.   An Hon. MEMIRER .-- You are putting the cart before the horse. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- No, I am not. I am starting absolutely in a logical way. I began, in the first place, showing that we have got the referendum in one shape in this country -- that is, in regard to the Alcoholic Liquors Act. Then I seek to point out that there are other questions which might fairly be settled in the same way, and I think that without any abro- gation of legislative power the Legislature might very fairly remit such questions to the public, to be solved by the elceters in the most direct way possible. I admit there is a diffi- culty of expense; but expense ought not to enter into the question of constitutional practice, he- cause if the question is worth putting, and if the State requires the question to be solved, it ought, I think, to be prepared to pay the piper. But. still, I admit that it would cost a i good suin of money, and therefore I should be sorry to see this question put too often. I would very much rather see New Zealand adopting the practice of the American States, and of the Federal Government, which, as far as possible, concentrate their efforts in the direction of ob- taining an expression of the popular will one day in three years. If you put as many ques- tions as you like to the electors on the one day publie bedies en the same day as you can. The difficulty nowadays is that we have got so many local authorities-we have got so many days of dection that the janblie mind is hardly equal 10 the distraction of what an old friend of mine 1 used to call "reaming from poll to poll." It is a long way to travel- from pelo to pole -- and the electors in the past have made complaint, and with reason, that there are too many of these local elections, which might very well te concentrated on one day in the year. You should cieet your County Councils, your Borough Councils, your Read Boards, and your School Committees all on the one day, and the trouble of the vear would be all over. Probably they would all be cheted en very bannenious principles, and you would have local bodies perhaps that would be more in harmony with each other than we have them now. How- ever. that is merely by the way. But at the same time I believe in concentrating the exer- rise of the privilege of casting votes; and if the referendum was adopted in this country I should perhaps le inclined to restrict the referendum to being submitted, if possible, to such a time as the general election day. How- ever, I have endeavcared to show we have got the referendum in one form already. We have got questions which might very well be solved by a reference from Parliament. But then comes the question of legislatien-and those members of the Council who have spoken on the subject seem to me to have been extra- vagant, almost, in their denunciations of the proposals of this Bill. I do not know what is the opinion of this Comeil of these minds that have certainly erected the biggest legislative mounment of patience and per- tinacity over on the other side in the shape of the Commonwealth Act of Australia. I do not know what is the opinion of the Council as to the statesmen who have effected this great work ; and it is a strange thing that if honour- ale members of the Comeil will only read the Commonwealth Act, and study its provisions as regards this very question, they will find that nearly every provision we have got in this Bill is inserted there. And why is it inserted there ? Simply because the Commonwealth Act is the result of growing minds and living needs, and that the Act has been constructed so as to pro- vide the new Commonwealth of Australia with the latest methods of legislative machinery. They have got a Senate there. Some honour- able gentlemen were kind enough to say this Bill was an insidious attack on the privileges of this Council, and that it was absolutely a menace to their very existence. The Hon. Mr. SHRIMSKI .- Not here. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WAI KER .- It was said -- if not in those exact words, in words quite as strong; and, judging by the looks of the speaker, I should say that words were hardly sufficient to express exactly his sentiments on the ques- tion. But compare our condition with the Commonwealth of Australia. There they have got a Senate, which has been put in a command- 
<page:166>
They have got more power in that direction than any other Upper House in the world. They have got every privilege that an Upper House is possessed of. They have got the big task of protecting the integrity of the privileges of each State on the basis of equal representa- tion. And certainly the last intention of the Commonwealth Act would be to endeavour, by a sidewind, to make it possible to belittle or destroy the Senate. And yet that Common- wealth Act has got provisions in it that are almost identical with the provisions of this Bill, which we have been told right and left in this Chamber are nothing more or less than an attack on the Council, and an attempt to make it possible to destroy it within a few years. The charge is so preposterous, Sir, that I hardly know how to meet it. Certainly I can sas this : that very few mem- bers of this Council have taken the trouble of reading the Commonwealth Act. And I should hope that they would have done it, because it ap- plies so pertinently to the present occasion. I hope the Council will excuse me if I quote just one or two points from the Commonwealth Act. because it is instructive to find how very similar the provisions of that Act are to the provisions of our Referendum Bill. I think I cannot em- phasize too much the point that this Common- wealth Act should be taken with the greatest amount of consideration : that it is the latest exponent of modern legislative machinery ; and that no one can accuse that Constitution of doing anything else except to erect two strong  Houses : and if any fault can be found with the machinery, I think it has, if pos- sible, made the Senate a little too strong for the Lower House. But there it is with this strong Upper House. Still, there is here in its provisions a great deal that is very much the same in our Bill. The Constitution specifies two methods by which a proposed alteration may be allowed. In the first place, "it may be formulated, and passed on to the electors, by absolute majorities in both Houses of the Federal Parliament." Well, that is exactly one of our proposals in this Bill. When this Constitution was going through the Conventions and parlia- mentary discussions, when it was passed by the Parliaments of the different colomes, there was no one said then it was degrading to either Chamber that matters of this sort should be remitted to the electors. It was looked upon as a perfectly natural and logical way of getting the views of the electors on certain questions which were outside of ordinary politics -- questions that might be social, that might be more or less political in a certain sense, or, it might be, questions on which it was desirable to get a direct vote of the people as to what they wished and what was their will. And here we see that the Constitution Act of the Common- wealth of Australia begins by establishing that both Houses by resolution may remit certain questions to a vote of the people. In the second place,- Hon. Lr. W. C. Walker posed alteration, with or without any amend- ments agreed to by both Houses, may be sub- mitted to the electors." And this must be dono after an interval of three months. And that is a very different thing. "An interval of three months." I ought to emphasize that, because under this Bill, according to our usual eastem and accord- ing to our Standing Orders, we cannot bring up the same question twice in any one session after it has once been decided. In the Com- monwealth Act, on the other hand, it says after an interval of three months the matter can be again proposed, which means, of course, in the same session, because the sessions there last a very much longer time than our sessions do here. Therefore it is quite possible for a question to be brought up at the beginning of a session, carried, rejected by the other House, and after three months again proposed in the House which rejected it, and sont again to the other House for reconsideration : and that is very much stronger than anything proposed in this Bill introduced by the Go- vernment, which, of course, provides that the proposal must be made in the following session. Then, No. 4 is : "The Governor-General may submit the proposed amendment to the electors in cach State," showing that the procedure under the Commonwealth is very similar to what is proposed in this Bill, and is absolutely the result of the labour of the most mature minds in Australie in regard to its machinery. And, more than that, this Act has been subject to the criticism of all the great minds of the day. It has been subject to Press commentary. Every legal mind which has been dealing with the framing of constitutional laws in all the different law-schools of the Anglo-Saxon world has had this question under consideration, has commented upon it, and has noted where it differs from other Constitutions. All those authorities have expressed themselves strongly in approval of the new lines which have been herein laid down. Sir, I think I have said quite enough on this subject to show that the Australian Commonwealth Act has contained in it powers and opportunities for taking a popular vote of the electors in a broader sense, and at shorter intervals, than we are proposing in this Bill ; and yet I have been told in this Council that this is not only a Bill that is not required, but that it is a Bill which could only be intended as a constructive attack upon the privileges of this Chamber, and even upon its existence. Well, I think, Sir, I have demolished pretty well all those arguments. If this Bill is an attack upon the privileges of this Council, then, I say, the Australian Commonwealth Act contains within itself the seeds of early dissolution, as that Constitution would not hold very long if the two Houses got into antagonism one with another. The Hon. Mr. SCOTLAND .- Wait and see how it works.  
<page:167>
anything that is not recommended by very good doctors. If doctors generally waited to see how their prescriptions operated no one would care about their prescriptions. I prefer to be in the position of the prescribing doctor, not of the Coroner ; but I am astonished at the amount of ditheulty which apparently is in the minds of most honourable gentlemen who have spoken on this question. I should have thought, from the persistent way in which this question has been kept before the public for a good many years, that now most honourable gentlemen in this Council would have recognised it not as a new question-not as a question which they were afraid to touch or afraid to debate - but as a question which has grown on the public mind, and which the public mind is perfectly willing to accept as a legitimate development of modern Liberalism. I see nothing in the Bill which offends against my ideas of true Liberalism or strikes a blow at the proper re- sponsibilities of Parliament. If I thought that Parliament was going to shelter itself behind the referendum and get away from its true re- sponsibilities I should be very sorry to uphold it. But I do not think that Parliament ever has given up its birthright in any way what- ever. At any rate, this Council has never been afraid to state its mind or to perform its func- tions when it felt that it was in the right. It has always done its duty to the country in the face of those people who are ready to condemn it, and even at the risk of offending some of its friends. I do not see, therefore, why in a Cham- ber of this independent nature. a charge should be brought against the Bill that it is a method of enabling the revising Chamber to divest itself of its proper responsibilities. I do not think it   is a method of doing anything of the kind. I recognise, and the Government recognise, that there are many questions that do not fit into current politics-that many friends and many enemies take views on certain questions which cannot be held to be in the ordinary ebb and flow of current politics; and these ques- tions, because they are so intermingled between friendships and enmities of political life, might very well be settled in a method which would keep them apart from current politics, and allow the electors to help the country to come to a conclusion. I have not referred to Switzer- land and its history. I have not referred even to America. I believe a good many wild state- ments have been made about both countries. Certainly I have not the latest information before me, because I found on going to the library that a member of the Council had been there before me, and I was unable to refresh my memory. But, if my memory is correct, I believe that those honourable gentlemen who quoted most largely were out in some of their facts, as the referendum is an in- tegral part of most of the American Constitu- tions and certainly of several. But I think we have an authority now beyond dispute, now that I have cited the new Constitution of the infancy ; it is only putting its armour on, and it is not possible to say what the result will be of any of its legislative machinery ; but, still, 1 think the state of the Commonwealth is such that it is certain to struggle through all its trials with success. It has, at all events, been equipped with exactly the same machinery, as near as possible, as this Bill proposes in order to prevent trouble in future as regards differ- ences between the two Houses. I have not quoted the whole machinery; it was not neces- sary. Deadlocks are provided for, but deadlocks are the least part of the trouble. I have quoted what I thought was appropriate and fitted in with our conditions, and I quoted enough to show that Australian minds have de- vised the same expedients as we have in this Bill in order to get the mind of the people on certain subjects. I feel certain the Australian legislative machinery, supported as it is by the public mind there, and the result of the most intelligent minds in that big Commonwealth, will work well, and convince, probably, by its practice those who are not convinced now that New Zealand had better also adopt the referen- dum in some shape or form. I am sorry my efforts have failed if all those who have spoken stand to their professions and are likely to vote against the Bill. I can only say, if the Bill is thrown out on this occasion, when it appears again I trust those who now reject it will have taken the opportunity during the interval be- tween this session and the next to study the question afresh, and perhaps with the example of Australia before them they will endeavour to see some merits in the proposals of the Bill.

Mr. PALMER (Ohinemari) .- Sir, while this Commission was collecting their evidence I think it is a pity they did not al-o prepare a report on the education systems of the whole of the Australian Colonies. Iconsider it would tend towards federation if we were to bring our educational how into emformity with that of Australia. I only throw out the hint to the Premier, because I hope that very soon we will ; assist with surohs s. I would therefore urge have a Commission set up to inquire into the education > vetem of the colony, so that it might be brought into conformity with the whok. of the Australian Colonies. Mr. MASSEY ( Franklin). - Sit. I would like to take this opportunity of asking the Premier whether he intends to introduce a Bill to give effect to the report of fle Commission ? Mr. T. MACKENZIE (Waihomo). - Sir, with regard to the suggestion of the homoprable member for Chinematri, that the Commission should have considered the various education systems obtaining in the Australian Colonies, 1 wish to say that we had before our Commission the most copious evidence on the systems pre- vailing there, and also the personal experience of some of the members of the Commission who had formerly been connected with the Victorian educational system. Regarding the question of bringing our system inte conformity with the systems prevailing in the other colonies, I would point out that this colony is pecaparly circumstanced, and therefore what we have course, from the other colonies those portions of their systems which we consider would be of service to us. That, I think, you will find has been done in this report. With regard to the remark that emanated from the member for Franklin, I would say it is sincerely hoped the Government will see their way to adopt the alternative proposal. The limit the Commissioners wore confined to was a El capitation grant. We have submitted a sale in keeping with that amount, and no doubt in many parts of the colony that wil be a great improvement ; but if the smaller educa- tion districts in New Zealand are to get that justice which we venture to hope the colony will extend to the smaller education districts, then, after the mest careful investication and extremost care, the Commissioners have re- ported that they consider &# 2. Cd. is neces- sary to extend and make what we might con- sidor a nearly perfect system of education for the elony. The 64 capitation grant, if given under the old system to each district, was very inequitalle. because the larger districts, having a number of large schools in their districts, Bad a surplus provided for the benefit of the smaller i schools within their territory, whereas the smaller districts, such as Marlborough, Grey- mouth . --- An Hon. MEMBER. - Are you not anticipating the report ? Mr. PIRANI .-- He is anticipating another BAL Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- The member for Pal- merston is generally right, but on this occasion he is wrong. We have adjusted our Botanical Gardens differences, and we have been met in a Very proper manner. I am simply replying to the remarks that were raised by one or two members, and I was just about to close by sev- ing that the smaller dintiiets obtaining the some grant would be drertally handicapped I because of their having so few large schools in the Premier, with all the power I possess, to adopt the &# 24. Ed. capitation scale. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerstom .-- I hardly think it is fair to the rest of us in the House that one of the Roval Commissioners should discuss the report before we have had an opportunity dreading it. In connection with the question put to the Premier, as to giving effect to the report, I would like to ask the honour !! gentleman whether, when considering the advi- sability of binging in a Bill of the kind, he will also consider the question of the extension di the powers of Education Boards in regard to i the removal and transfer of teachers from one school to another, according to the abilities of the various teachers? Unless some provision such as that is put in a measure dealing with salaries it will militate against the advantage of having a colonia scale of salarios. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- Sir, I do not think it is advisable for us to debate this large ques- tion shaply on the receipt of the report of the Royal Commission. All members should be 
<page:169>
an opportunity of perusing the evidence, they will be in a better position to discuss it and to give their conclusions thereupon. The member for Chinemuri suggests that the Commission should have been extended to enable the Com- mi -- ioners to proceed to the other colonies to take evidence there as to their respective edaica- tional systems. Well, it must be admitted that in the honourable member's case the suggestion comes from the best possible motive and with- out the slightest tinge of selfishness. At all events, if it had boon decided to extend the powers of the Commission to that extent, I do not know that there is any one else in the ; in my name. House who would have been bettor fitted for the work than the honourable gentleman him- self. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL. - Why did you not put him on the Commission ? Mr. SEDDON .-- Because the gentlemen we selected were immediately connected with Pau- cation Boards and with the education question. However, as an old Victorian, and as one who has some knowledge of the working of the educa- tion system there, I may say that I much prefer what we have here in our own colony. There they have what is known as the central sus- tem. The teachers and schools are directly under the Goverment and Goverminent in-pec- tion, and I do not think the system works nearly so well as the system we have in vogne in New Zealand. Its cost is, I believe, greater relatively to the education that is given. am one of those who do not believe too much in having the whole system uniform. In my opinion, diver-ity really improves and perfects education, and I consider that by having our Boards in the different provincial dis-   triets we secure a more complete education in the colony than is given in any of the Australian Colonies. Therefore I do not think we have anything to loin from Australia in respect to education. The next question I was asked was as to whether the Government intend to give effect to the recommendations of the Commission. I have not had time to peruse the report. The question, therefore, is premature. Unless the honourable member has been in the secret of the Commission and know- what the report is, he should not ask me the question. He should find out for himself, first of all, whether it would be desirable to give effect to the recommendations : and then, when he has himself come to a conclusion, he might put the question to me, and be better pleased by the reply, whichever way it may be. My reply at the present moment is that the Govern- ment will carefully consider the report. We will do whatever we believe to be best in the interests of the teachers and our schools and education generally in the colony. am, at all events, pleased so far to find that the Commission do not see any great difficulties in the way, and that they have propounded a scheme keeping within the 41 capitation. And they have another scheme outside that : that with an increase of 2s. Od. they have re- complete scheme for the small difference of 2& Cd., I am, when circumstances permit, in favour of effect being given to that rocom- mendation. However, the best thing I can do is. I think, to allow the report to lie on the table, and get the evidence printed. If we decide then that something is to be done, and if it requires logi-lation, I will bring down proposals, and then let the House debate the proposals and the report at the same time. I think that is the best course to adopt, and 1 indicate that as generally the course which will be followed. I move the motion stealing Motion agreed to. PATRA HARBOUR BOARD BILL. # IN COMMITTEE. Clause 3. Power to borrow. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) moved to add the following words : " But no money shall be bor- rowed under the authority of this det which shall produce to the londer a higher rate of in- terest than four pounds ten shillings per centum per annum." Amendment agreed to. Bill reported. # DUNEDIN CITY AND SUBURBAN TRAM- WAYS BILL. INTERRUPTED DEBATE. Mr. T. MACKENZIE .-- When I was inter- I rupted by the adjournment of the House on Tuesday night, I was dealing with the City of Dunedin Tramways Bill, but since then, Lam glad to say, a conference has been hold with the Mavor, and Mr. Frederick Chapman, and Mr. Milan -- representatives of the City of Dun- edin - and other members of this House, and ! am glad to say that I was enabled to accept con- ditions on behalf of the objretors, which are satisfactory. We are now to be privileged for all tim: in having secared the whole of the Botani- cal Gardens as far back as the Opoho and Cone- tory Roads free from tramway construction. 1 am glad to say this, on behalf of the gentlemen representing the City of Dunedin : that we were met in an execedingly fair spirit, and I vonfare to say that after all is over the public will find that the best for all parties has been done. Mr. MILLAR (City of Dunedin). - Sir, in reply to some of the objections that have been made to this Bill, I think the principal ones were raised by the honouradde member for Wailemo, and the honourable member for Caversham - namely, the proposal or supposed idea that the tramways were to go through the Botanical Gardens. I am pleased to say that we have been able to come to a settle- ment on the matter, and I think the amend- I ment I shall move in Committee will got over the trouble. But it is only fair to the City Council, in view of the strictures that have been passed, that I should say this: that the City Council were acting on the advice of the best known experts on electrical haulage, and their 
<page:170>
control of a work that is going to cost close on a quarter of a million, deemed it their duty to take the line through the district that was going to give the best results. That was the only object in taking it through the Gardens. honourable members only saw the line which the tramway will now have to follow, they will find that there was a great deal of force in the contention that it should be kept in as straight and level a line as possible, because, in order to obviate the necessity of taking the tramway through the Gardens the line will have to be taken at two right angles and join, because in an electrical tramway you must have a con- tinuous circuit. That was the only object, and it is only fair to the City Council to say so. They had no desire in any shape or forin to spoil the Gardens or to infringe on the right of the public in connection with the Gardens, but, in view of the position taken up, and because their desire is to get the work started as soon as possible, they have agreed to put in a proviso that the present Botanical Gardens shall be exempt, and that the tramway-line will not go through them. In the proposed line there is another reserve which will be of some use in the future. On the other side of the road to the Gardens there is a piece of land which for some time has been wanted for a reserve, but the Council have not been able to take it because there has been a road running through it for forty years -not a surveyed road, but one which by use has come to be a public road. Under the new proposal this difficulty will be got  over, because the objectors to that road being closed will likewise be met. The only other clauses to which objection was taken were clauses 17, 18, and 19, with the exception of the objection of the honourable member for the Taieri. But, Sir, there is no force in his objec- tion, because if, as the honourable member for Bruce pointed out, that was carried to its logical conclusion there could not be any such thing as a waterworks or reservoir in any part of the colony, and there could be no such thing as a dam site granted by the Warden's Court anywhere, because the risk of a dam breaking away and flooding will always exist, and I think ample precaution has been taken. When honourable members read that the pro- posed dam is to be 30 ft. at the base, they must admit that it is going to be a substantial struc- ture, and that there will be very little risk. But without any dam at all the district which the honourable member represents is some- times flooded. It is not so very long ago since it was a sheet of water all over the plain, and no greater force of water can come down with the dam than if there was no dam there. I think the House will agree that, so far as the honour- able gentleman's objection is concerned, we cannot give it much weight. Now, Sir, to refer to what was said by my friend the honourable member for Caversham. In his speech he said that he would always endeavour to give me every assistance in the passage of the Bill. I Mr. Millar will withdraw it altogether-I will move to have it struck out. There was no idea on the part of the Council to take any advan- tage of any of the suburban boroughs. It was If intended to deal with the tramways as a whole. There are about eighteen miles of tramway in the proposed scheme, of which two miles and a half run through the Borough of Caver- sham, and the rest runs through the city and other boroughs. It was thought it was only fair that the City Council being the promoters, and being the ones who were taking the risk of the whole thing, that it should be treated as if two-thirds of the length of the tramway were in the City of Dunedin. I will, however, in Com- mittee move to strike out clause 19. Then, with regard to clause 17, the honourable member spoke on that under a misapprehension I think ; but, seeing that likewise there has been some feeling in connection with that, I am prepared to withdraw the clause. But I will show the House that that clause has nothing to do with suburban districts at all. It was simply to en- able the City of Dunedin to extend the tram- ways without taking a poll. The reason for that was that technically, by the Bill, a voto has to be taken for every extension. But the poll has already been taken. A poll was taken on the proposal to borrow $200,000 as stated in the Preamble,- " For the purpose of completing the said pur- chase, and for other purposes mentioned in the proposal submitted to the said electors, the said Council has raised the sum of fifty thousand pounds, part of the said sum of two hundred thousand pounds, by means of deben- tures in the form set forth in the Second Schedule hereto, and contemplates raising the further sum of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds authorised by the said Act and sanc- tioned by the said vote, either in New Zealand or the United Kingdom, or elsewhere : And whereas futher sums may be from time to time required for the completion or extension of the said system of tramways and for other purposes connected therewith, and with the use and enjoyment of the said mining privileges," et cetera. An Hon. MEMBER .- Subject to the Act of 1884. Mr. MILLAR .- This poll was taken under the Dunedin City and Suburban Tramways Act of 1900. An Hon. MEMBER .- Subject to the general Act. Mr. MILLAR .- Yes ; but the object of putting this clause in here was that the citizens of Dunedin, having had the oppor- tunity of voting on the whole of the proposal, and having carried that poll. it should be un- necessary again to ask the citizens to reaffirm their previous decision. I could not accept the proviso that was inserted by the Committee. The new line along George Street has been sanctioned, and is recognised as the route, yet it has not been sanctioned according to the 
<page:171>
been sanctioned by them. There was no attempt in any shape or form to infringe any of the rights of the suburban boroughs. But, Sir, seeing that the suburban 3.30. boroughs imagine it would, and that as it stands at present it is valueless, be- cause they have to take a poll, it is just as well to knock the thing out altogether and let them take another poll. It is simply adding the expense of taking another poll on to the citizens of Dunedin, and adding to the cost of the tramways, but they are prepared to do so rather than have any trouble over the Bill. Sir, I think that, having conceded these points, the whole of the objections to the Bill have been met, and I trust that when the Bill gets into Committee there will be no further trouble. If there are any further amendments of a nature that I can reasonably accept I will be prepared to do so at the hands of any honour- able member, but I think, so far, I have met the whole of the objections. I beg to move the second reading. Bill read a second time. # REMUERA WATERWORKS EMPOWER- ING BILL. Mr. LAWRY (Parnell) .- Sir, in moving the second reading of this Bill on behalf of your- self, I would like to point out to honourable members that the Bill has been before the Local Bills Committee, and I see it has been returned with only slight amendment proposed by yourself. I do not see that there can be any single objection to this Bill. One clause in the Bill provides for borrowing £15,000, and any person who knows the Remuera district as I know it, and as you know it, and as the honourable member for Franklin knows it, will know that there cannot be a single doubt as to the district being well able to provide ample security for the money proposed to be borrowed. When the Bill gets into Committee perhaps I shall have something to say in the same direc- tion as was argued by honourable members re the rate of interest ; but that is a Committee objection which you, Sir, will be fully capable of dealing with. The ratepayers have, by what I might term an overwhelming ma- jority, indorsed fully the proposal contained in this Bill of borrowing #15,000 to furnish their district with a copious supply of water. On the 2nd May, a poll was taken on the proposal contained in the Bill of borrowing the money, and the result of the poll was 274 in favour and 83 against. I remember, Sir, in the year 1888, there was an amendment to the Road Boards Act which empowered two dis- tricts now represented by myself-namely, the Eden Terrace and the Mount Eden Road Boards, to borrow money under the conditions prescribed under that Act, which further en- acted that the provisions of that Act should apply to any other Road Boards to which they may be declared to apply by any Act of the General Assembly. The Remuera Road Board for the same purpose. I do not think, Sir, that it is necessary for me to detain the House at present with any further comment on the Bill. The Bill is very plain and very simple, and I do not think there is any honourable gentleman who knows anything about the local require- ments of the district between the Waitemata and the Manukau, who would not be prepared to indorse and support the proposal contained in this measure of establishing a good supply of water for the important and thriving district of Remuera. Bill read a second time. # TEMPLETON DOMAIN BOARD EMPOWERING BILL. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton) .- Sir, this is a very short Bill of a purely local character, and it has passed the Local Bills Committee. In the early days of Canterbury a number of domain reserves were set apart for the recrea- tion of the people, and amongst them was one called the Templeton Domain. It is a some- what valuable endowment, from which a sum has accrued by way of rentals, amounting to something about +300 or $400. But in the meantime two or three townships have sprung up, and as they are without recreation-grounds the Templeton Domain Board wisely desiro power to spend its accrued capital in providing recreation grounds in other parts of its district. It therefore asks the power to do so, selecting at this juncture the townships of Templeton, Yald- hurst, and Hornby, and such other places as may be fixed upon. The necessary safeguard is in- serted that the Minister of Lands shall in each case be satisfied that the position of the land is suitable and the price reasonable. I may say, in further explanation, that the substantial parts of this Bill were included in the annual washing-up Bill last session, and received the imprimatur of the Lands Departinent ; but unfortunately, honourable members will re- member, that Bill went by the board at the close of the session, and I therefore had to wait another year, and the proposition has been introduced in the shape of a local Bill. I have much pleasure in moving the second reading. Bill read a second time. WELLINGTON CITY RECREATION- GROUND BILL. Mr. J. HUTCHESON ( Wellington City) .- Sir, it has been felt by the citizens of Welling- ton, who feel the necessity for an extension of the area of our city, in addition to providing addi- tional breathing-spaces and recreation-grounds, that this area should be acquired, subject to the approval of the ctizens being first obtained by a poll, as provided by the First Schedule to the Municipal Corporations Act. The Bill is purely a machinery Bill, and forms the basis for the proposals to be submitted to the electors. I do not know that there is anything in connection with the Bill that honourable members require to have explained to them. It merely provides 
<page:172>
any further explanation I shall have great plea- sure in giving it in my rov. Mr. WILFORD (Wellington Suburbs). - Sir. I should like to have something to say in regard to this Wellington City Recreation-ground Bill. It is really a Bill to enable the Commeil to par- chase for the City of Wellington 1.800 acres of : land situated at Miramar. The Bill is called the City Recreation-ground Bill, and honour- able members will imagine that it is a Bill to enable the city to purchase an area of land, say, of 100 or 200 acres, as the case may be. for the purpose of a recreation-ground onis. But it is a Bill to enable the Mavor and Council of the city to purchase a block of land to the extent of 1,500 acres. Now, it is well known, without my going into any details at all, that, so far as the Wellington City Council are concerned, and so far as the finances of the Council are con- cerned, that they are in such a state at the present time that it is absolutely impossible for them, apart from the clauses of this Bill, to enter into any speculation at all. The streets of Wellington are a disgrace to the City of Wellington ; they are .the worst-kept streets in the colony. It is impossible on a wet night for any man to walk, even on the pavement, with- out stepping into holes and into large quagmires of mud, even on the main footpaths. Mr. PIRANI .- It is very evident you have not been to Auckland. Mr. WIL.FORD. - Yes, I have been to Auck- land ; but I do not think Auckland is quite as bad. We might, perhaps, say that in a race for supremacy there would be a dead hoat ; but  I give the palm to Wellington from what I know. Sir. this Bill places a very large power in the hands of the Councillors, and I may tell honourable members that the citizens of Wel- lingten are very much divided in opinion as to whether or not the City Council should be empowered to purchase this land for such a huge som as 575,000. Had the Pill simply been a Bill which gave an opportunity to the Council of purchasing an area for reercation purposes close to the city. all would have sup- ported it, especially if the price to be paid was to be determined by arbitration. But what is this going to lead the City of Wellington into? In the first place it is suggested that the pur- chasing price of the property -- 1.500 acres --- is 475.000. The real value is about $40.000. That is put down as the sum for which the Council may secure the property from Messis. Crawford Brothers, who own the area in ques- tion on the Miramar Peninsula. Honourable members will understand that before that land can be made easy of access to the city there must be an eletric tramway provided, either by a tunnel through Kilbirnie Hill or round vid Oriental Bay, or a line of steamers running every hour must be provided. Again, what has to be contemplated in a matter of the kind by the City Council is the expense of reading the estate, if it is purchased. Roading, lighting, access, and cutting - up would be expensive items. I notice there are provisions enabling Mr. Hutcheson introduced for the purpose of getting over the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of the Canterbury Racecourse Trust action that carte before the Court recently. Evidently the intention of the Connell under this classe is to make a racccourse of Miramar. Whether or not that is correct I do not know, bat, at ony rate, I am putting it forward so that the hopourable member in charge of the Bill mav tell me whether or not that is the intention of the Council. I do not know whether clause 4 of the Fourth Schedale of the Bill has been wounded in the Local Bills Committee. but it should have been. I would like to know fram the honouralle member in charge whether that obcetional le chanse is still in the Bill An Hon. Mi! MBFR .- NO. Mr. WILFORD. - Then, the position is that the City Council desire power under the Bill to purchase 1,500 acres at 175.000. and they reserve to themselves the power to borrow the money required under "The Municipal Cor- [ portions Act. 1:00." Now, to my mind, if Miramar could be got on advantageous telles, and if the City Council could be intrusted to carry out a business deal successfully, it might be well that this Bill should pass : but I say -- and I am sure I know what I am speaking about -- that the present constitution of the City Council is not such a constitution that the citizens of Wellington believe they could carry out a business deal like this to the advantage of the citizens. Mr. HUTCHESON .--- The citizens put you out of it, anyhow. Mr. WILFORD .- The honourable member is hitting at me Lecause I was beaten by Mr. Aitken in the Maveral contest. Well. as far as that is concerned, I would not have thought much of Mr. Aitken if he had not beaten ine. I would have thought the citizens held him in poor esteem ineed it be had not beaten me. an untried min. He is a tried servant, a man of undoubted standing, and an cki citivon, and if he had not beaten me I would not have though: much of him. For myself, i did not expect that I would beat him, and, Sir. 1 can tile a beating, which is more than the honourable member can do. However, what to sov now is that, under its present constitution, the Council is unfit to carry on dealings like this, and I will give only one instance to prove the absolute inability of the Council to tackle such a matter. Local members will be well acquainted with the facts I am about to relate, but other members will not be. & me time ago the City Council, under the Fallin Works Act, acquired a block of land at the corner of Willis Street, on which Wiele situated promises known as the " Beko." The buildings were valued for the City Council rating purposes at, say, $13,000 in the first instance. After the Council had taken over the property the own as put in a claim, through their solicitors, for $25,000 for the land. Now, hore I may tell honourable members in conf .- 
<page:173>
than the applicants really believe the land to be worth. Well, the owners of this land put in an appleation for $25,000 for land that was worth $11,000 or $12,00), or $13,000 at the most. What happened? It was the duty of the Council, under the Public Works Act, to reply to that application, and to say within -ix y days whether they accepted the price the claimants required for the property or not. The City Council actually had sixty days in which to write back and say, " We accept at the price you state, and we are prepared to pay "; or to say, on the other hand, " We contest your claim." But if they do not deny -- if they do not contest the amount the owners are claim- ing-they are deemed under the statute to admit it. Well, the sixty days passed, and this City Council, to which it is now proposed to give power to expend $75,000, had not replied. They had forgotten to reply. Eighty days passed and they had not replied. After the ninetieth day had passed, the City Council awakened, like Rip Van Winkle, from their sleep, and became aware of the fact that the owners had entered up judg- ment against them in the Court for $25,000, or, ratther, for three-fourths on a basis of $25,000. At any rate, judgment was entered up for that amount, and the City Council, awaking from their apathy, called to their assistance Mr. Martin, who is admitted to be an adept at municipal law. Their solicitor engaged the most eminent counsel that New Zealand bas known, who applied to the Court of Appeal, and, in the words of leading counsel applied ad miseri- condam to the Court, and asked for legal for- giveness for their carelessness and inadvertence, and trusted that the mistake which they had made would be overlooked, and that they should be allowed to question the amount, and to set up a Compensation Court : because, according to the affidavits of the leading officers, the amount they had to pay was far in excess of the amount the land was worth. What did the Court do ? By a majority of four to one they said " How are you going to over- ride the statute law ? " And, after the expense of the Court of Appeal had been incurred, judg- ment was entered up against the City Counel for the amount claimed without any deduction whatever. To-day that is the judgment again-t the Council, and the Council, with a disregard of the public purse, and knowing that they have only got the ratepayers' money to deal with. have taken the matter to the Privy Coun- cil. The Court of Appeal simply stated in their deci-ion -- the decision was a lengthy one, but it came to this in a few words : " where any claim is not denied or contested in sixty days, it is deemed to be admitted." The result is that the City Council, by the order of the Court of Appeal, have to pay to the claimants thousands of pounds of the ratepayers' money more than the property is worth. Well, now, is that the kind of Council that should have placed in their hands the power of borrow- ing $75,000 for the purchase of land? Let me They started give you another instance. signed-the Chairman of the Streets Widening Committee-because he does not believe the Committee is carrying out the work in a proper manner. They started the work of widening Adelaide Road by buying the land on the right ! side of the road, and after they had gone some distance up the road they skipped to the other side of the road to start on that side, and, instead of buying the land on one side of the road right through, they bought a bit here and there; and when the owners of land saw the Council coming their way they raised their prices accordingly. This fixed the standard so high that when the street-widening process is completed the City Council will find that they have a big bill to foot. But, however, I suppose the long-suffering ratepayer will pay the piper. I may say that I am speaking not only as a member, but also as a ratepaver. 1 would ask: Is that a body of men that we can repose confidence in to enter into negotia- tions in a deal of this Lind? We have already agreed to electric tramways, and to having the streets paved with wood. I would ask mein- bers of the House to look at the state of the streets to-day. I do not consider that the Council as at present constituted is such a Council as should be given these powers of deal- ing with the ratepayers' money in the way sug- gested. The member in charge of the Bill seems to think that if I had been elected I would have carried on the business better. Well, all I have got to say is this : that when a man makes terrible mistakes he has to run the consequences, and the present Council have made mistakes which can never possibly be redeemed. An honourable member says I have made mistakes. Undoubtedly, I have ; and I believe the honour- able member in charge of the Bill, Mr. Hutche- son, is the only man who is immaculate in this House -according to his own idea. Mr. ATKINSON. - What about me ? Mr. WILFORD .- The honourable member is next door to the most immaculate man in the House. I may inform members that the purchase of Miramar for $75,000 is not mutually consented to by the citizens of Wellington to-day. Numbers believe that it should be ac- quired, and numbers believe that it should not be acquired at the price stated. If Miramar were easy of access to the city, if it could be cut up into land for workmen's homes, if workmen could get to and from there quickly. I think some good would be done in acquiring the land, even at a big price. But I believe at the present time it would be inimical to the in- terests of the City of Wellington to give the Council as at present constituted power to acquire Miramar at the enormous cost of $75,000. If the Bill is postponed the price will soon be reduced. To $75,000 has to be added the cost of roads, and some engineering scheme will have to be evolved for the purpose of getting access to the property. 1 therefore shall vote against the second reading of the Bill for acquiring the Miramar Estate, because I believe that in the present state of the city's 
<page:174>
think the price is altogether beyond the value of the land. That is my real objection to the Bill. Had we left the price to be determined by a Compensation Court, I should have viewed this Bill differently. Mr. BARCLAY (Dunedin City) .- I have listened with considerable interest to the dis- cussion which has taken place, and I must con- fess I am becoming exceedingly interested- and, I suppose, a good many other members are also-in the affairs of the City of Welling- ton, because they appear on the floor of this House so often. I was considerably impressed by what fell from the honourable member for Wellington Suburbs, in whose constituency, I understand, the property is. I do not observe in this Bill any provision for taking a vote of the ratepayers. An Hon. MEMBER .- Read clause 5. Mr. BARCLAY .- I suppose the contention of the honourable member is that under "The Municipal Corporations Act, 1900," a poll would be necessary. I think, however, some time ought to be given us to look into this mat- ter, and, therefore, I move, That this debate be adjourned for a week. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City). - I appeal most earnestly to members of this House to consent to the adjournment of this debate. The proper legal notices, I suppose, have been given of the intention to introduce the Bill, and it has passed through the usual examination by the Local Bills Committee ; still there has not been afforded to the people of the city, nor to one of the members representing the City, such infor- mation as we ought to possess before passing a Bill of such importance. I have not had time to master the Bill, although I know 4.0. sufficient of its contents to justify me in opposing its further progress at this stage. I am aware that there is a very strong feeling on the part of the majority of the people of this city that this Bill should not pass, and we are anxious to have an adjournment of the debate in order that we shall be fully armed with the opinions of those opposed to it, and with the fullest information before it goes to the second reading. I ask honourable mem- bers to pay some deference to the opinion of the member for Wellington Suburbs and myself, who represent the majority of the citizens of Wellington. I personally am aware that there is a very strong feeling against the Bill, and I stand here this afternoon to appeal to members who cannot possibly be familiar with the whole circumstances surrounding this Bill, and the purchase of that land, to give us time, to get all the information we desire to have before it goes to the second reading. I am making this appeal to honourable members because I know it to be the wish of the great majority of the citizens of Wellington that the Bill should be allowed to stand over in order that full expression may be given to their views in regard to this proposed purchase of Miramar. An Hon. MEMBER .- They can express that at the poll. Mr. Wilford proposal was before the House on a former occasion. Of course, if members in their wis. dom decline to give us further time to consider the contents of the Bill, we must leave the decision to them ; but I do seriously hope that the House will agree to the motion for an ad- journment, on the ground that we feel that we have not had time to consider all its provisions, and also that we may be able to consult the people themselves, who maintain that they have not yet had the proposal fully placed before them. Mr. HUTCHESON (Wellington City) .- As to this question of the adjournment of the deb :. te, I say that, if the citizens of Wellington declare that they are not in favour of the acquisition of Miramar, this Bill, if passed into law, will be no better than waste-paper. Here in the Bill is a definite proposal, "Will you give us power to borrow money to do that? " Everything is bound down hard and fast, so that there can possibly be no evasion or malversation. That being so, I would ask, Is there any necessity for delay to get further information for honourable mem- bers? I would further point out that the whole thing is dominated by a poll of the citizens. Can anything be fairer than that ? I could enlighten honourable members of the scheming and the plotting and the intriguing of wealthy syndicates and landed interests of this city to militate against the scheme. I can do that later on. There is a foul conspiracy of landed proprietors to prevent the citizens getting this property, so that they will be the better able to sell their own land ; but I will content myself by simply making that statement at present. It will be well for some of those gentlemen if they do not push their intrigues too far. This is a democratic measure, and in accordance with all our municipal legislation. There is no necessity for further inquiry. The Bill simply sets out how the land shall be dealt with after a poll of the citizens says that it is to be ac- quired, and if honourable members will take an unbiassed view of the case they will not vote for the adjournment. Mr. MEREDITH .- Has the question been before the public ? Mr. HUTCHESON .- Yes, it has, and is now ; and the public is taking the liveliest interest in it. Mr. COLLINS (Christchurch City) .- For obvi- ous reasons I rise to support the suggestion that the debate be adjourned for a week. In deal. ing with local Bills members not immediately affected by local considerations must be more or less at the mercy of those local members who are acquainted with the facts. In this case we find the honourable member for Wellington Suburbs and one of the members for Welling- ton City-the one opposing the Bill, and the other asking for an adjournment. I admit that it is difficult for me to at once express an opinion in regard to this measure, and, if I should be called upon to do so now, I could scarcely give an intelligent vote on the matter. 
<page:175>
for the purposes of a recreation - ground, and I shall want a good deal more information on this point than the Bill affords before I can vote for it. I fully admit that, before effect can be given to the provisions of the Bill, an expression of opinion must be obtained from the people themselves, but that does not absolve us from a careful discharge of our duty ; and since there is divided opinion amongst those who should be possessed of the facts of the case, further time should be given for consideration of the matter. I do not wish now to discuss the Bill, but to simply give reasons why the debate should be adjourned. The honourable member for Wellington Suburbs maintained that the Council should not have the control of the expenditure of a large sum of money, because they had already shown themselves in- capable of looking after the proper interests of the city. I would like honourable members to pay particular attention to the condition of the Wellington streets, over which they have to travel every day, and, if they do so, they will come to the conclusion that they are a dis- grace to the Empire City of New Zealand. Mr. HUTCHESON .- Poor old Wellington ! Mr. COLLINS .- It is all very well for the honourable member to say " Poor old Welling- ton," but I can say that I know of no town in New Zealand which can compare with it in the matter of its disreputable streets. This must reflect upon the City Council, and gives strength to the argument of the honourable gentleman who represents the Suburbs.  32106019788246 Mr. SPEAKER .- You are getting away from the question of adjournment. Mr. COLLINS .- I think this matter should be borne in mind during the week, which, if this     motion to adjourn the debate be carried, will intervene, so that members themselves will recog- nise the strength of the argument with regard to the incapacity of the City Council. I should like to support the honourable member's Bill, but, since the local authorities are divided, we should have more time to consider it. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) .- I have not heard any cogent reason why this debate should be adjourned, and I would point out that the Order Paper gives each member notice of the business that is to be brought on; and if an honourable member does not make himself ac- quainted with the Bills that are to come up for discussion, then it is clearly his own fault. I submit that this Bill, coming to us as it does with the imprimatur of the local governing body, and having passed through the Local Bills Committee, which has devoted careful attention to it, we ought to hesitate before we refuse to pass the second reading, which merely affirms the principle of the mea- sure. If there are objections to details, of course, they can be attended to in Commit- tee ; but it seems to me that, unless we are to deprive the citizens of Wellington of local self-government, we ought to pass this Bill. That the Wellington City Council has not provided good streets has nothing whatever to confidence of the citizens-which under our law we must assume it possesses-comes for- ward and asks us to pass a Bill. What to do ? To enable it to submit a proposal for the bet- terment of the city to the electors. The Bill is not to enable the Council to purchase property or to pay money away, but to enable it to ask the individual citizens, "Aye" or "Nay," " Is it desirable to purchase this property for a recrea- tion-ground for the people?" It is merely to enable the Council to submit this question to the referendum, and holding as I do that the people are the final arbiters, and this being a permissive measure to submit the question to the citizens, I would ask honourable members to agree to the second reading to-day, and as to the Committee stage, that can be fixed for some future time. Mr. HALL- JONES (Minister for Public Works) .- Sir, I must confess the amendment moved has put me in a somewhat difficult posi- tion. As the member in charge of the Bill knows, I have looked upon this Bill with a good deal of suspicion, but if the position is made clear then I wish the Bill to proceed. With regard to the acquisition of a recreation-ground for the City of Wellington, I am entirely at one with any man in Wellington in desiring to see re- creation-grounds; but it is the terms under which the proposed recreation-ground is to be acquired that I am not at all clear about. I am not a lawyer, and, unfortunately, I was engaged in the House for a great portion of the time while the Local Bills Committee were discussing this question ; and after they had got through the Bill-I was only there while some of the latter clauses were being discussed -I learned that there was something beyond the Bill, and that was the contract between certain persons and the Corporation. Indeed, I was informed that the contract would be laid upon the table of this House. May I ask if that has been done ? Mr. SPEAKER .- There has been no contract laid on the table. Mr. HALL-JONES .- Well, if that has not been done, I think it ought to have been. I think the contract should be printed in its en- tirety, and that every member of the House should have a copy of it. I repeat that I am as anxious as any one to see any number of recrea- tion-grounds provided for Wellington ; but from what I read of the Bill yesterday in the Local Bills Committee-room it struck me that tho Corporation could acquire the estate without going to the ratepayers. An Hon. MEMBER .- Oh, no. Mr. HALL-JONES .-- Well, it struck me that they could acquire that property without going to the ratepayers, because, if what I hear of the contract is correct, they have to pay no money down, they have to raise no loan for some years ; and hence the provision of section 4 would not come into operation. Mr. SPEAKER .- You cannot discuss the Bill. 
<page:176>
' and desired to refer to the matter that there is a prevailing opinion that something is behind this Bill ; and I submit that members ought to be apprised of the terms of the contract-they ought to know every clause of it. To the sticitor in charge of the Bill who accompanied Mr. Hatcheson, I pointed out that one of the danses, the only one I have seen in the con- trici, would bave been better embodied in the Bill. As I said before I am no lawyer, and there may be nothing in it, but it struck me that the Corporation could acquire the estate without taking a vote of the ratepayers, because they are only to pay interest upon the capital sum at 23 per cent. That being so, my inclina- tion is to support the adjournment. I think the honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Hutcheson), might agree to that, and we could have the contract laid upon the table and printed at the Goverment Printing Office. It would then be a public document, and if printed and circulated amongst members it will be seen what the contract is, and the Bill can then be dealt with next week. There need be no objection to the delay, because two months can elapse after the close of the session before the Corporation need come to a decision to take the property. I am not clear on the mitter. This is the first I have heard of any influence at work to prevent the Bill passing : but I have heard of some influence being brought to bear to secure its passing, though I absolve the member in charge of the Bill from any connection with the influences I have heard  of. For these reasons I think it would be well for honorable members to have the opportunity of knowing not only what is in the Bill, but also of knowing what the contract is under which the estate is to be acquired. Mr. ATKINSON (Wellington City). - I wish to say a word upon the question of the adjourn- ment. It is surely a most extraordinary motion, and has been supported by most extraordinary arguments. The proposal is that the debate shall be adjourned for one week. Why? Be- cause certain members -certain local members who are opposed to the Bill - want during that week to pick up sufficient information to oppose the Bill, though during all the months and years the matter has been under discussion in the City of Wellington they have been unable apparently to acquire sufficient information for that purpose. I am sorry the honourable mom- ber for Christchurch City (Mir. Collins) has left, but I will undertake to say that any argument that may be advanced now for adjourning this Bill for a week would apply equally to adjourn- ing any other local Bill for six months. Sup- posing the Bill affected the City of Christ- church, what would be gained by adjourning it for a week, or for six weeks? The honourable member wants members to see how dirty the streets are, and from that to obtain a means of judicially determining this question. Mr. HALL-JONES .- That is apart from the question. Mr. ATKINSON. -- That was an argument ment. Of course, he has not yet spoken upon the Bill itself. Now, it appears to me that, according to the views of honcurable mem- bors-including, I regret to say, one honourable member for the City of Wellington and one for the constituency next the City-every city and locality in this colony is competent to manage its own affairs except the City of Wellington. Why, actually the member for Christchurch City (Mr. Collins), who is a firm believer in democracy, said that as the local authorities were divided with regard to the Bill, therefore this House should take a week to think over it-to think over the matter of giving the right to take a poll of the citizens. This matter has been one of publie discussion for years, and there was not a single candidate at the last municipal election but was asked about it, and expressed an opinion about it. In fact, there were some who expressed two opinions about it during the same cam- paign. That will show that it was really a burning question. I admit that the Minis- ter for Public Works has put something more like a case for the adjournment, and it is clear that it is not merely for the sake of hostility to the Bill. As far as the ques- tion of the contract is concerned, 1 simply turn upon him the argument which I used previously against the honourable member for Christchurch City ( Mr. Collins). This is only an empowering Bill. It empowers the City Coun- cil to make terms, and it empowers the citizens to say whether the terms made by the Council are to be approved. If the city is competent to manage its own affairs, I fail to see why it shall not be competent to make this contract. That is my answer to the Hon. the Minister for Public Works. Mr. HALL-JONES .- We ought to have the contract before us. Mr. ATKINSON .-- The Minister is candid in his attitude to the Bill : it is quite a fair atti- tude ; but I would suggest that this Parliament, if it chose, might appoint Commissioners to ad- minister the affairs of any city, and it would have precedent for it in the State of Pennsyl- vania. Because there the Mayers of four of the second-class cities, about the size of Wellington, did not give satisfaction to the powers that be -.- because they were of the wrong " colour "-" the Parliament of that State pissed a special Act dismissing those Mayors during their terms of office, and empowering the Governor to ap- point Mayors of the right " colour " to adminis- ter the affairs of those cities for the remainder of the term. This Parliament is quite capable of doing that, although I do not think it is anxious to do it ; but I would point out to the Minister that, unless we are going to adopt that attitude-if there is nothing immoral in the Bill, if it is simply an empowering Bill-we ought to pass it. But if the Parliament thinks it is more competent to administer the affairs of the city let it do so. Of course, I know that the Minister would not go the length I have sug- gested, but I put it to him that, that being so, 
<page:177>
and there being no question of a surprise being sprung on the city or the citizens, he should let the city decide the matter. I said that if there was any argument at all for the adjourn- ment of this Bill for a week it would apply to adjourning any other local Bill for six months. Let me point out to honourable members that if there was any strong section of malcontents to this Bill the House would be flooded with petitions and deputations. It would be a per- fectly easy matter for any constituency to do, and far easier with regard to this con- stituency than any other in the colony. We know that the minority have remained ap- parently in acquiescence. It may be that there is a majority of the city which is ac- quiescent, for the simple reason that it knows it has got the power in its own hand, even if the Bill were passed, to say " Yes " or " No." The last consideration I will urge is this : Three months ago the mayoral and municipal elec- tions were held, and by a very large majority, a record majority in the case of the Mayor- and we have the unsuccessful candidate re- peating almost verbatim a part of one of his election speeches on that occasion - and by large majorities, in some cases by two to one, almost the whole of the old Councillors were re-elected. The Mayor and Council so elected ask us for this Bill. There is no local question affecting any part of the colony on which the people in- terested are better informed than are the people of Wellington on the subject-matter of this Bill. I therefore urge upon the House that this  unusual motion of the honourable member for Dunedin City (Mr. Barclay) should not be adopted, and that we should go through with the Bill. Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister for Public Works). - Before the honourable gentleman sits down I would like him to point out in what way the position will be prejudiced if the Bill were adjourned for a week, and the con- tract printed and circulated among the mem- bers, so that the House and the whole of the citizens of Wellington could know the terms of the contract. Mr. ELL (Christchurch City) .- We have four large centres in the colony, but I venture this opinion : that there is not a city where there is more interference with local matters than with the City of Wellington. Ever since I have been in this House, whenever anything crops up with regard to Wellington there seems to be a storm raised and an attack made upon some one. Now, Sir. this Bill has been pointed out as being purely permissive. Mr. SPEAKER .- The honourable member cannot discuss the Bill just now. Mr. ELL. - I refer to the discussion I have just now listened to by the honourable memler for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) and the Minister for Public Works, in favour of postponing the second reading of this Bill. Now, Sir, I remem- ber the reports in the Christchurch papers, and also those in the Wellington papers, at the time of the municipal elections in this city. I take an interest in municipal elections, and I know this question cropped up frequently. The Wel- VOL. CXVII .- 11. lington electors, it seems to me, are being treated with scant courtesy, and their intelligence is being discounted by the proposal which is being made. Surely the Wellington electors are suffi- ciently intelligent and alive to their own in- terests to determine on a question like this. An Hon. MEMBER .- Let them know the con- tract. Mr. ELL .- There is ample provision in the Municipal Corporations Act to protect the rights of the public, and the Minister knows it per- fectly well. Before the loan can be submitted a public meeting must be held, which must be advertised for four consecutive weeks, and at that meeting any ratepayer can question the Councillors or the Mayor as to the proposal. They have to be enlightened on every point ; and yet we have the honourable member rising up here, in the face of all the safeguards in the Bill, and saying that a permissive measure like this shall not pass. I have heard remarks hinting that this was a job, and that a little light would be shed on it. It occurs to me that the steps now proposed to be taken are with a view of shedding a little daylight on what is reputed to be a job. I have not heard anything that would lead me to suppose it is a job. I have not heard anything that would justify me in suggesting that the electors are not cap- able of deciding this question for themselves. We all know this Bill was coming before the House, and, as the honourable mem- ber for Wellington City has pointed out, if there had been any strong suspicion in the minds of the local electors we should have had plenty of deputations to members, and we should have had numerous petitions. Local public opinion is very much alive in Wellington. But, Sir, instead of the opposition, and 4.30. instead of the suspicion being amongst the local electors, it seems to me it is simply centred in two local members. That is where the suspicion is, and there only. It is certainly not in the minds of the local electors. Now, a short time ago they voted upon a proposal to spend a very considerable sum of money in this city for the purpose of tramways and other im- provements, and the question now to be sub- mitted to them is for their benefit. It has been a long time before them, and I venture to say that they will be quite capable of casting an in- telligent vote upon it. They know all about it, and they can know all they desire to know about the proposal before they cast their votes. I shall not support the proposal to adjourn this debate for a week. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) .- Sir, I do not think sufficient argument has been adduced for the adjournment of the debate. I submit that it would very likely jeopardize the Bill, because if the second reading is not taken to-day it will be postponed for a week. I presume the Finan- cial Statement will come down in a fortnight's time, and the opportunity for the committal of the Bill will then be lost. Now, Sir, strong argument ought to have been adduced to induce honourable members to vote for postponing the debate. Sir, the Hon. the Minister for Public Works asked a question of the member in 
<page:178>
charge of the Bill in respect to the agreement, { in permitting the second reading to-day, and I understand that he was already in pos- session of an amendment suggested by the honourable member in charge of the Bill which would have removed his objection altogether. The honourable member in charge of the Bill submitted to the Minister for Public Works the draft of a clause which perhaps I may be per- mitted to read, as it bears on the question of the adjournment of the debate. It is as fol- lows : "This Act shall not be deemed to authorise the Corporation to purchase or take the said land unless either a special loan shall have been first authorised under this section to provide the purchase-money or estimated compensation, or an epitome of the leading provisions of the contract for purchase shall have been submitted to a poll of the burgesses or ratepayers of the city and shall have been approved of by a majority of the votes cast : Provided, however, that a full copy of any contract for purchase and a tracing of every plan drawn thercon or annexed thereto shall be deposited at the City Council Office, and shall there be open to public inspection for at least seven days before the taking of the poll." So that the honourable gentleman in charge of the Bill has met all that the Minister for Public Works desires. The Minister for Public Works desires that the contract between the sellers and the Corporation should be printed in full. Well, I submit it would not be fair to ask that to be done at the present time, for this reason : that it may disclose business at the present moment which it would not be right nor fair to the sellers to disclose; and if an epitome of the whole contract is to be circulated   broadcast before any poll is taken, and if the full contract is to be deposited in the City Council seven days before the poll is taken, what in the world is there to take objection to ? Even apart altogether from that, what reason is there for the adjournment of this debate ? This matter, according to our own Standing Orders, has been before the residents in the city for at least three weeks publicly ; plans have been deposited in the Stipendiary Magis- trate's Court ; the whole thing has been advertised for three successive weeks; the matter has been before our own Local Bills Committee, and an opportunity was there af- forded to anybody who had an objection to the Bill to appear. I understand that not a soul has turned up to raise an objection, and I understand that for two years or more the whole question has been before the ratepayers of this city in one form or another. Mr. WILFORD. - There was a petition of 531 ratepayers against it before. Mr. J. ALLEN .- There has been no petition against the Bill this time, and the Local Bills Committee did not hear one word against the Bill ; and I submit that it is unfair to attempt to kill the Bill in this way, and therefore I myself shall not support the adjournment of the debate. I think honourable members will bo dealing fairly with the member in charge of this Bill, and only fairly with this city, Mr. J. Allen because the Committee stage cannot come on until next Thursday; and between now and next Thursday, if there is anything further to be said against the Bill, there is plenty of time to produce it, and it is not too late even at the Committee stage to stop the Bill. Nor is it too late even at the third-read- ing stage to stop the Bill if there is anything in it that is not proper. A poll of the citizens, according to the Bill, will have to be taken. A special poll has to be taken, and all the matters therein set forth are to be detailed, and there can be no doubt in the minds of the citizens as to the question they are voting upon. I submit it is not fair to this city that we should deprive them of an opportunity such as this to provide for themselves recreation grounds, which this House, I am quite certain, desire the larger cities should obtain. The House divided on the question, "That the debate be adjourned." AYES, 26. Allen, E. G.

Mr. SPEAKER .- It appears to me that as the critical stage of the Bill-that of committal -cannot come on for another week, and if there is any amendment made then the third reading cannot come on for another week, the citizens of Wellington have at least a fortnight to bring before the House any objections they may have to the passing of the Bill. I do not think I should interpose an extra week's delay in the progress of the measure. I therefore give my casting-vote with the " Noes." Motion negatived. Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister for Publis Works) .- Sir, I would ask the mover, in his reply, if he will carry out a provision which, I understand was made before the Local Bills Committee, that the contract should be laid before the House, and if he is prepared to lay it before us. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) .- Of all the daring attempts to hoodwink and bafile the people of this city this is the most daring. Mr. HUTCHESON. - The attempt to adjourn the debate. Mr. FISHER .- Sir, I believe the honourable 
<page:179>
gentleman in charge of the Bill claimed your protection in the early part of the session against the interjections of another honour- able member. I now claim your protection, Sir, against the interjections of the honourable gentleman. Mr. SPEAKER .- I did not hear any interjec- tion. Mr. FISHER .- Sir, I now repeat that of all the daring attempts to hoodwink and baffle the people of Wellington this is the most daring of them all. The honourable gentleman who moved the second reading of the Bill, in speaking to the motion for the adjournment, referred to certain schemers who were opposing this Bill because they wished to work a swindle of their own. You will observe, Sir, that the word "swindle" was used and not objected to. Now, I declare that of the two this is far and away the greater swindle. Mr. HUTCHESON .- I deny that I used the word " swindle." Mr. FISHER .- I heard the honourable gentleman apply the word "swindle " to what he called an opposing scheme. Now, I say that such a disgraceful proposal as this was never before submitted to this Parliament. I have watched the history of this purchase from its very inception. When the Bill, which in- cluded some other proposals, was placed before this House in 1897 I presented a petition to the House, signed by 584 burgesses of the City of Wellington, protesting against the purchase of  this Miramar Estate. But the House, in its wisdom, as it does to-day, pretended to know more about the matter than the members who represent the city, and so it passed the clause sanctioning the purchase of the Miramar Estate. Sir, I will not call the proposed purchase a swindle. 1 will not apply to the proposed purchase any term which you, Sir, will not allow to be used ; but the term which correctly characterises it is in common use among the burgesses of this city. When the proposal was first submitted to the burgesses at a meeting in this city by Mr. H. D. Bell, who was then Mayor, he bound himself to sub- mit to the motion, whatever it might be, carried by the citizens in regard to the purchase of this property. The Evening Post of the 23rd July, 1897, contains this report :- ## " The Purchase of Miramar. "The Mayor suggested that the Council should defer consideration of his proposal for the purchase of the Miramar Estate until the public meeting had given its views on the subject. "The Mayor pointed out that the Council would be governed by the feeling of the public meeting." The public meeting, convened officially by the Mavor, was held at the Skating Rink on the 24th August, 1897, and was distinctly adverse to the Mayor's proposals. There were twenty- two votes in favour of the purchase and eighty- five against it, and the leading article in the Evening Post - Mr. Bell's claqueur-showed that the meeting was decidedly adverse to the pro- posals. And I say that, in the face of such a deci- sion on the part of a large and representative meeting of the burgesses of the City of Welling- ton, it was nothing short of monstrous that Mr. Bell should ask Parliament to fly in the face of the citizens, by whose decision he pledged himself to be bound. Yet we have gentlemen in this House who, by their speeches to- day, profess to know all about the matter. Well, what was the consequence? In spite of the decision of that meeting, and in spite of the petition of 584 burgesses of the City of Wellington against the Bill, it was smuggled through this House by the votes of members who will persist that they know all about our affairs, while we who live on the spot, and who have investigated this matter thoroughly, are not allowed to give any advice upon the matter. I say that these long continued efforts to foist this estate upon the city show what persistent efforts are being made by the schemers who are at the bottom of the pro- posal. Now, five years ago the Miramar Estate was valued for property-tax purposes at £24,000. At the next valuation, when it was proposed to shunt the estate on to the Cor- poration, a convenient and obliging valuer was found, and the valuation was put up to $75,000. So that the Corporation was to be bled for the difference between £24,000 and $75,000. And I want to know why the people of this city should be asked to pay $51,000 more than the owners of the property valued it at a few years previously. Then, why is the amount of the purchase-money not stated in the Bill ? Why should the city be asked to buy a pig in a poke ? I come now to a point which has already been dealt with by several honourable members, but which cannot be dealt with too frequently or too seriously. Clause 3 of the Bill says,- " Subject to the provisions of section fivo hereof, it shall be lawful for the Corporation to purchase the land comprised in the First Schedule, or any part thereof, in pursuance of the contract existing before the passing of this Act or of one to be made thereafter." Where is that contract ? Was such a thing ever heard of before ? The city is to be bound by a contract of which we know nothing, " or of one to be made thereafter !" Do we dream ? Can such things be ? There is a secret under- standing, a secret compact, entered into between the Corporation and Messrs. Crawford Brothers, the owners of the property aided by the power- ful influence of Mr. H. D. Bell, their solicitor, or trustee for some one connected with the estate. Then, the property is to be purchased " subject to any roads or rights of road or any easements through or over the same or any part thereof." Roads, rights of road, and casements are reserved to give value to all other parts of tho estate, and all at the expense of the Corporation. " And subject also to any leases or tenancies of or affecting any parts of such land." Why not make the proprietors of the estate a present of $50,000 and be done with it ? That would be a far more straightforward transaction, and one that the citizens could casier understand. Now, let me go back one stage in the history 
<page:180>
of this now famous estate, and call attention to the action of another branch of the Legis- lature in regard to it. After all our efforts in this House to prevent the passing of the Bill of 1897, the measure went to the Upper House, and there the iniquitous character of the pro- posal was discovered and made plain to the members of that Chamber. The part of the Bill relating to the purchase of Miramar was expunged. But the promoters of this scheme-I must not use the word " swindle "-are unceas- ing in their efforts ; the passing-away of years does not discourage them. It rears its head, and flaunts itself as boldly as ever. Now, I ask, with the member for Wellington Suburbs, Is the Wellington Corporation composed of men fit to be intrusted with the management of such a large estate, in addition to the management of our ordinary municipal affairs ? Those honourable members who profess to know all about this Bill surely know something of the condition of our streets and footpaths. I have heard many of them express themselves very freely upon this subject when there is no proposal to purchase Miramar on the board. And a Corporation which so sadly neglects its primary duty, and makes plain the fact that it is incapable of carrying out the ordinary duties of a City Council, quite gaily proposes to take over the management of an estate comprising nearly fifteen hundred acres. I am now going to refer to what may be called a trifling matter, but it is a matter to which the New Zealand Times has frequently called attention-namely, that it is never possible to get the annual balance-sheet of the Corporation in anything like decent or reasonable time. I applied to-    day at the offices of the Corporation for a copy of the annual balance-sheet, and the latest copy I could get is dated the 31st March, 1900. What would happen at our Public Accounts Committee if the annual accounts of the colony were produced a year and a half after their due date? I wonder what the member for Bruce and the member for Wakitupu would say at the meetings of the Public Accounts Com- mittee if the accounts of the colony were so de- layed. Accusations would be made against the Government that they were endeavouring to conceal the state of the finances of the country. Now, I wish to show from this balance-sheet how the City of Wellington is already indebted, and how it is proposed to still further burden the already over burdened ratepavers. This is the "Statement of the Public Debt of the City of Wellington," as published in this balance- sheet :- 8\. 1\. Consolidated Loan . . 200,000 0 2\. City Improvements Loan . . 100,000 0 3\. Wainni Waterworks Loan 130,000 0 4\. Sanitation Loan No. 1 165,000 0 .. 5\. Sanitation Loan No. 2 33,000 0 . . 6\. Private Drains Loan 8,600 0 . . 7\. Te Aro Reclamation Loan 25,000 0 8\. Loan under clause 189 of the Municipal Corpora- tions Act .. 9,500 0 0 .. 9\. Cemetery Loan 0 0 7,500 .. Mr. Fisher £ s. d. 10\. Pahiatua Loan 324 17 0 11\.

Miramar 75,000 0 0 . . €1,259,924 17 0 Now, contrast that enormous indebtedness and the rates of the city with the indebtedness and the rates of the other large cities of the colony. These are the latest figures I have been able to obtain, for the House has refused to allow time for inquiry and verification :- Rates in Public Debt. the Pound B. d. £ Auckland 449,900 2 10} .. Christchurch 66,000 2 4 Dunedin 603,300 2 8} Wellington .. 670,000 3 6 Our present rates amount to 3s. 6d. in 5.0. the pound, with an indebtedness of £734,924. Will those members of this House who profess to know so much about our muni- cipal affairs kindly tell us what our rates will be when our indebtedness is raised to £1,259,924 ? Do they wish us, as in the case of Oamaru, to be driven out of the city by burdensome and exces- sive rates ? When all these loans are raised, at the very least one-fourth of the property of every person in this city will belong to the Corporation . one-fourth of the income of every man or woman who has invested in city pro- perty will have to be paid to the Corporation in the shape of rates every year. No sum is set down in the Bill for the purchase of Miramar, but we must assume-for we have not this secret contract before us-that it will be $75,000, the original price asked. When the city was first asked $75,000 for this pro- perty the seaside part was attached to it, but all this seaside portion has been sold by the proprietors for seaside residences and summer resorts, but all that part of the estate is gone, and the Corporation is now asked to pay $75,000 for what is really the refuse of the estate, the outer fringe or more valuable part having been turned into cash. Parliamentary d. usage, Sir, would not allow me to characterize 0) this proposed purchase as a swindle; I am 0 therefore debarred from using the word. I 0) must therefore leave my opinion entirely to the imagination. What, now, in reality, is 0 the object for which the city is asked to 0) purchase the remainder of this estate? It 0 is this : The agitation to purchase the Miramar Estate comes not from the citizens of Wel- lington, but from the owners of the estate, who bring to their aid and assistance the influence 
<page:181>
of the members of certain aristocratic clubs. Before touching upon that point I would like to ask who paid for the circulation of the maps. such as those contained in a particular issue of the Evening Post, announcing that this was the Miramar Estate, which the Corporation proposed to purchase. In the first place, I assumed that the Corporation authorised the printing and circulation of those maps, but, on reflection, I came to the conclusion that it must have been done by the vendors, for surely the Corporation would not be guilty of such an illegal and reprehensible act. But, then, did the pressure to purchase this property come from the people of Wellington ? No. It came from people who have little concern in the municipal affairs of Wellington-people who are not called upon to face the rate-collector and the Magistrate if the rates are in arrear. The land is to be purchased to provide golf grounds, polo grounds, hockey grounds, and a racecourse. Now, I ask, Sir, does the working- man, the small ratepayer, of Wellington want a golf ground ? Does he want a hockey ground ? Does he keep polo ponies? Does he want a polo ground ? Does he want a racecourse of his own ? I certainly think the members of the Wellington City Corporation would be a splendid body to manage a racecourse. And these are the pressing reasons why we are asked to purchase this estate. I would not so much object to the purchase by the Corporation if it were not for the rates we shall be called upon to face, and I ask, with such a prospect before us, can we afford to in- dulge in such a luxury? It is purely a rate- payers' question. I repeat the question, Do the members of this House wish to impose an indebtedness of $1,259,924 upon a small city like this? It is really too much to ask us to bear. And, then, why did not the honourable member who moved the second reading of the Bill give the House some information in regard to its contents? Why move the second reading without saying a single word? It would have been just as easy for him to have told the House what the designs and projects of the Bill were as to leave that for other members to do. I undertake to say that the career of the Bill of 1897 will be repeated. The Bill may pass this House, which pays such little attention to pro- posals of this kind, but I sincerely hope the Legislative Council will reject it. I fervently hope the Legislative Council will take the wise and judicious step it took in 1897 in regard to this same proposed purchase. I would ask those members who really understand anything of the question whether we have not enough parks for the City of Wellington already. Mr. PIRANI .-- No. Mr. FISHER .- Again the member for Pal- merston knows all about the matter. We know nothing. We have the Basin Reserve. An Hon. MEMBER .- Too small. Mr. FISHER .- Oh! That is too small. Well, we have the Athletic Park. Mr. HUTCHESON .- Which is private pro- perty. Mr. FISHER. - Oh! That is private pro- perty, isit? Well, then, we have the Newtown Park. Mr. PIRANI. - Which is a Government camp. Mr. FISHER .- The honourable member calls it a Government camp. It is the very best recreation-ground in this city. But the most important consideration of all, which has not as yet been touched upon, is this: that the Public Reserves Acts, passed in many Parlia- ments from the year 1881 onwards, distinctly declare that all public reserves shall be reserved for the exclusive use and benefit of the public, and that they shall be open to the public at all times without fee or charge. Now, we are asked- Mr. HUTCHESON .- There are exceptions on a certain number of days each year. Mr. FISHER .- There are no exceptions of any kind whatsoever in the Public Reserves Acts. There is no bar to the public. The reserves are the property of the public. But under this Bill these croquet clubs, hockey clubs, and golf clubs are to be allowed to pick out the choice parts of this ground under lease which excludes the public. The estate is to be purchased with the money of the people of Wellington, and these clubs are to have the right to lease the land for their purposes at a peppercorn rent, and to exclude the public from the use of the land. The public of Wellington are in reality to purchase land for these clubs. If these are not grounds sufficient to induce the great mass of the people to move in this matter I should like to know what would be? Then, some honourable members have said, as the honour- able member for Auckland City (Mr. Napier) has said, that the people themselves are to decide the matter-that a poll is to be taken. I ask any member to read the Bill and point out to me one word relating to a poll of the people. An Hon. MEMBER .- Clause 5. Mr. FISHER .- Clause 5 says,- "The Corporation may raise, under the pro- visions of 'The Municipal Corporations Act, 1900,' any special loan or special loans for the purpose of providing the whole or any part of the purchase-money or compensation to be paid by the Corporation for or in respect of acquisition of the said land or any part thereof ; and also for providing funds for constructing roads and drains upon or under the said land or any part thereof, and for developing and improving such land." Where is there any mention of a poll ? Mr. PIRANI .- Provision is made in the Municipal Corporations Act. Mr. FISHER .- Why is it not to be found in the Bill? I have the Municipal Corpora- tions Act of 1900 before me. I have read all the provisions relating to special loans. and I am extremely doubtful whether under those clauses the Corporation are compelled to take a poll. I undertake to say that if this clause is not altered no poll will be taken, and the ratepayers will find themselves burdened with this estate whether they like it or not. 
<page:182>
Now, Sir. I have said all I wish to say in regard to the Bill. Of course, the quidnunes who know all about the affairs of the City of Wellington - and it is really astonishing to me how little we know about our own affairs-can tell us all about it. The next time I want to find out anything about the affairs of the Corporation of the City of Wellington I will take a trip over to Nelson to see the honourable member for Nelson City, Mr. Graham, and I am sure he will be able to tell us what we ought to do. Sir, I denounce this proposed purchase of Miramar as an iniquitous proposal ; it is a proposal that ought never to have been submitted to the Legislature until the ratepayers of the city had been fully consulted in regard to it. I have shown from public records that a few years ago the burgesses, in public meeting assembled, declared themselves strongly against the pro- posal, and I saw now distinctly that the Bill has been smuggled into the Legislature without the knowledge of the general body of the people of Wellington. I shall vote against the second reading of the Bill. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston) .- I intend to sup- port the second reading, on the ground that it is right in matters of local government to trust the people. So far as the tirade of the honour- able member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) against the Bill is concerned, nearly every Wellington Bill that has been introduced into the House has evolved the same opposi- tion, except that he usually supports the second reading. He is going to oppose the second reading of this Bill. The honourable member's game usually is to box the compass by opposing the measure in words and sup- porting it by vote. For the first time in his political history, so far as it relates to local government, he is going to be consistent, and he is going to oppose this Bill by vote as well as by voice. But I would point out that the House ought to take into consideration not so much what are the merits of the proposal contained in the Bill, but what the people who have to pay the rates and practically provide the money think of the proposal; and I say, if the House is not prepared to trust the people with this measure of local self-government, it is time the House had a rest till it came to its senses. But the mem- ber for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher), strange to say, seeing that he takes this role in the House year after year, is never heard objecting to these proposals on the public platform. He is not inclined to trust the people. Mr. FISHER .- No, they trust me. Mr. PIRANI .- Well, not often ; and, when they do, perhaps they find out their great mis- take. But he comes to the House, where he has the right of saving what he pleases under the sacred cover of privilege, and attacks men whom I am sorry to hear him attacking, when all the circumstances surrounding himself aro taken into consideration. But he would not dare to attack them on the public platform, and I think it is an abuse of the privilege of meinbers that this sort of thing should be encouraged on every local Bill in reference to the City of Wellington. If the provisions as to Mr. Fisher the taking of a poll are not sufficiently stringent, make them as stringent as you like. But who has widened the powers of the ratepayers of the colony in regard to the taking of polls for rais- ing loans? The Government which the honour- able gentleman supports so strenuously through thick and thin have abolished every safeguard in regard to the taking of polls for loans. At one time it was necessary that there should be a certain proportion of ratepayers as a majority in order to insure a loan ; that has been abo- lished now to a bare majority. Mr. FISHER .- Mr. Bell introduced that. Mr. PIRANI. - The present Government have introduced it vear after year in their general enactments. If Mr. Bell did initiate it, ho was certainly doing what the Government the honourable gentleman so strenuously supports is doing in general enactment. I think it right that those who take an interest in these matters, and who take the trouble to go to the poll and vote, should decide, and that dead men and absentees should not be allowed to rule those who are most interested in the development of the city. The honourable gentleman has told us that Wellington has suthcient public parks. I should like to know where they are? The honourable gentleman has been largely con- cerned himself in the local government of Wel- lington ; what has he ever done in the direction of providing places of recreation for tho people of Wellington ? Talk about finding polo grounds and golf grounds! Does ho not know a little more about the athletic doings of the young people of the city than to think those are the amusements their energies are confined to? He ought to know what is the best safeguard for the young people, and what is in their best interests-to provide for them sufficient places of recreation and sufficient outlets, so that they should not be confined to the slums of the city. There is no place in the whole colony so poorly off for places of recreation as Wellington. You have the Basin Reserve in the centre of the con- gested population, and Newtown Park at the same end of the city ; but beyond that there is nothing in the city so far as recreation places are concerned. And if this alone provided for better recreation-grounds for the people of Wel- lington, that would entitle it to. the support of honourable members. But there are other proposals in connection with the land to bo purchased under the Bill that ought to meet with support. I am always prepared, and I believe the majority of members are prepared, to give to the people the right to say what they should do in their own interests. When we cannot do this it is simply because the choice of the people of their representatives in the House wants to be considerably altered. Mr. J. HUTCHESON (Wellington City) .- I should like to approach this question as calmly as it is possible for a citizen of Wellington to do ; but, after the amount of misrepresentation and abuse that has been heaped upon the city, its institutions, and people this afternoon, I might be pardoned for exhibiting some little ! heat. What do we find here now ? The Empire 
<page:183>
City of a young colony with its whole future before it; the port of this colony that is des- tined in the near future to become the Liver- pool of New Zealand ; and the total area within the city boundaries for all purposes at the pre- . sent time is not much over a thousand acres. Now, it must be perfectly obvious to the most casual observer in the city that there is no room for the ordinary extension even of business pre- mises that will be necessary in the growth of tho city in the next twenty-five years. The meaning of the proposals in this Bill is first to provide adequate recreation grounds for the people, and also a proposal, almost of equal importance-in fact, of greater importance-to secure an area of 1.100 acres-in addition to this 400 acres of recreation-ground-to provide for the future ex- pansion of the City of Wellington. Now, I ask those members of the House who are concerned in the question of the housing of the poor, whether every day there is not fresh evidence of the encroachment of business premises on the localities formerly exclusively devoted voted to workmen's residences ? Now, what is to become of a city like Wellington, confined as it is by the everlasting hills, with an area of something like a little over a thousand acres, how are we to provide for future expansion unless by choosing the line of least resistance, and pur- chasing that beautiful area of flat land, with its surrounding low hills - a total area of some fifteen hundred acres-known as Miramar. That is the proposal that has been denounced as a hole-and- corner scheme; and many other unhandsome  things have been said about it. The Minister asked me if there was not a deed of contract. There is a deed of contract, and the Minister knows it, and has seen it. #cc-zero Mr. HALL-JONES .-. Seen one clause. Mr. HUTCHESON. - I want to be perfectly just to the honourable gentleman. He just got a glance at it, and, although he has seen the instrument, he is not conversant with all its contents. But he has handled it, and he has also seen, and has now in his possession, a clause which was drafted at my instance by the City Solicitor in order to remove what were reasonable and honest doubts on the part of the honourable gentleman, that the Bill did not really provide for the absolute necessity of taking the people of Wellington into the fullest confidence of the City Council. Now, this is the clause that I suggested the honourable gentleman might permit me to put in the Bill in Committee : Instead of the words " Subject to the provisions of section five hereof," intro- duced at the beginning of clause 3, to insert the following words at the end of clause 5 :- " This Act shall not be deemed to authorise the Corporation to purchase or take the said land unless either a special loan shall have been first authorised under this section to pro- vide the purchase-money or estimated compen- sation, or an epitome of the leading provisions of the contract for purchase shall have been submitted to a poll of the burgesses or rate- pavers of the city, and shall have been approved of by a majority of the votes cast : Provided, however, that a full copy of any contract for purchase and a tracing of every plan drawn thereon or annexed thereto shall be deposited at the City Council Office, and shall there lie open to public inspection for at least seven days before the taking of the poll." The Wellington City Corporation have, under provisional memorandum of contract and deed of agreement, a right to purchase this estate of 1,500 acres for two months after the rising of this present session of Parliament. $75,000 is the sum agreed upon between the parties. There is a mortgage of $10,000 on the land at present, and the condition of the deed of con- tract-the main condition-is that the City Corporation discharge or take over the liability of this #10,000 on mortgage, and pay on the balance of the purchase-money 23 per cent. per annum. There will be a saving to the citizens of Wellington of at least 11 or 2 per cent. on the whole of the purchase-money. As was sug- gested by Mr. Speaker in giving his reasons for voting against the adjournment of this Bill, there is ample time after the second reading of the Bill to learn the fullest information on the subject, and I am willing to take every member of this House into the fullest confidence, and to let him see from start to finish every agreement, provision, and undertaking between the parties. There is absolutely nothing to hide ; but it will be ponderous and impracticable to put any such deed of agreement into an Act of Parliament when the only bearing it possibly could have on the subject only concerns the citizens of Wel- lington in casting their votes for or against it, or for or against the alternative proposal of a loan. Mr. HALL-JONES .- It was not suggested that the contract should go in the Bill. Mr. HUTCHESON. - I understood the honourable gentleman to say, "Why not lay the contract on the table, and get it printed and put in the Bill ?" Now, I can assure the honour- able gentleman I have not had time to study fully this deed of contract ; but it is only an alternative, and has been drafted and agreed to by the most popular City Council that has ever sat on the municipal benches, if we are to draw any deduction from the result of the recent elections. Just three or four days before the last general municipal election the Mayor and Councillors, the great majority of whom are now back in their seats in the Council, submitted proposals to the City of Wellington which in- volved raising loans for expenditure amounting in the aggregate to $330,000. For electric tram- ways there are £225,000; for the erection of a Town Hall, $50,000 ; for the blocking of certain of our principal streets, so as to remove from Wellington the stigma of having badly paved streets, $55,000-that is, for blocking on the most modern system the arterial streets of Wellington from one end to the other. And yet those gentlemen who oppose great reforms, and stand up in their place as iconoclasts, to smash up that which they had no hand in building, declare against the wicked, the profligate, proposal to spend £55,000 to remedy that which they declaim against. They want us to make bricks without straw. Now, I think 
<page:184>
it is only proper that I should refer to 7.30. some of the objections raised to the Bill, by those honourable members who, one might well believe, ought to be more friendly disposed towards the Bill. The member for the Suburbs, Mr. Wilford, gave as one of the reasons for his opposition to the Bill the astounding statement that the citizens of Wel- lington had no confidence in the City Council as at present constituted for the carrying out of this great work. In the face of the fact that we have had the first municipal election under the new Municipal Corporations Act, and that practically meant the granting of an opportunity to the citizens of Wellington of sweeping out the whole City Council - the Mayor and Councillors included- and to clean out, in fact, the Augean stable, and to restore it to cleanliness and order! Yet what did the citizens of Wellington do? Not only did they return the former occupant of the mayoral chair in opposition to the member for the Suburbs, but they practically returned, with one or two exceptions, the whole personnel of the Council. Now, the honourable gentleman instanced as a case of municipal muddlement the unfortunate oversight in connection with the acquisition of the Willis Street corner for municipal purposes, and held that up as proof positive that the present Council was incom- petent to discharge its duties. Now, the honourable gentleman himself, as a candi- date for the mayoral chair of this city, lost no opportunity of fully apprising the citizens  In a letter of the municipal shortcomings. to the daily Press prior to the election he re- viewed the whole case in all its aspects, and he informed the citizens what the inevitable con- sequences would be, and wound up the letter by asking, among other questions, what share did the Mayor and Councillors intend to take of the blame - did they intend to shelter themselves behind their officials? Well, it is human to err, and the particular official in question, the Town Clerk, anticipated the queries by giving a public statement accepting the whole of the blame. Now, many sins of omission followed by grave effects have oc- curred in all the ranks of life throughout all time. Was it not the most careful captain of the Union Steamship Company, the late Captain McIntosh, who perpetrated the greatest marine disaster we have ever had in our colony ? Was it not the most reliable, the most careful, the most competent shipmaster in the employ of the Union Steamship Company that was blameworthy for the sad " Wairarapa " disaster. Why, Sir, if the successful revolution of this world on its axis was dependent, for instance, upon the infallible regularity of the emptying of the ash-barrel in the back-yard, which service was performed by the most reliable of human mortals, one fine morning we should inevitably wake up and find ourselves whirling through space because the emptier of the ash-barrel had failed in his duty. Now, even the honourable member for the Suburbs himself is not in- fallible, and here I quote an instance to you, an exactly parallel case of the "act of inadvert- Mr. Hutcheson ence and neglect " with which he has charged the Wellington City Council Mr. WILFORD .- Two blacks do not make a white. Mr. HUTCHESON .- No, Sir; and those who live in glass houses ought not to throw stones, and those who commit similar errors to these ought not to be the first to point the finger of scorn in cases like this. The very day succeeding the honourable gentleman's exposi- tion of the shortcomings of the then Mayor of Wellington, such exposition being written with the full intent to damn the said Mayor's chances of re-election Mr. WILFORD .- What nonsense. Mr. HUTCHESON .- There can be nothing clearer than that to any unbiassed mind- there appeared the following counterblast in the columns of the Evening Post in reply. It says :- "Mr. Wilford appeared for that well-known and popular metallician Mr. Sol. Lewis, who was charged with laying ' tote odds.' The Magistrate convicted Mr. Sol. Lewis, and sen- tenced him to three months' imprisonment. Notice of appeal was given, and pending the prosecution of the appeal Mr. Sol. Lewis was admitted to bail. Now, here comes the rub : Mr. Tom Wilford neglected to prosecute the appeal within the statutory time allowed by law, and it was only after his client had been arrested and lodged in the Terrace Gaol that Mr. Wilford discovered that his neglect was likely to deprive the Willis Street public of the pleasure of Mr. Sol. Lewis's society for the This threatened period of three months. calamity was, however, averted by an act of grace on the part of the Crown and the Magis- trate in consenting to proceedings being taken de novo, so that Mr. Wilford could prosecute the appeal, Mr. Sol. Lewis being released from durance vile in the meanwhile. No doubt Mr. Wilford's failure in the first instance to prose- cute the appeal was accidental and due to inadvertence." I ask honourable members to recollect that that is a quotation in the precise phrases used by the honourable member in reference to the laxity and laches of the City Council. He said, magnanimously enough, no doubt, it was acci- dental and due to inadvertence ; but still, if the honourable gentleman will permit me to point out, he only succeeded in rectifying his inad- vertence and neglect by "an act of grace" on the part of the Crown and Magistrate, and no such " act of grace " was extended to the City Council by the hard-hearted property-owners, who demanded their pound of flesh. Mr. WILFORD .-- Buncombe, buncombe. Mr. SPEAKER. - The honourable gentleman must not make these interruptions. Mr. HUTCHESON. - These are the very questionable tactics so familiar to the honour- able gentleman. In refuting his statements I can easily show that he is condemned out of his own mouth. Now, to show the House that no blame could really attach to the present Mayor in connection with this unfortunate question, it is only necessary to remind honourable gentle- 
<page:185>
men that in filling an honorary office like that of Mayor it is absolutely impossible that one can attend to the routine of the daily business, which must naturally be left to the executive officers. The honourable gentleman said, "Look at the streets." Well, I say there, again, is another proof that the citizens have confidence in their present Council, because there is practically the same Council as when they submitted the ques- tion of raising a loan of $55,000 to block the streets of the city to the citizens, and the citizens responded ; prior to the election. Sir, I made an interjection this afternoon when the honourable gentleman was speaking, that we had proof positive that the citizens had confidence in the Council. He assumed that I was making a personal reference to his connec- tion with the election. It was not so intended. I meant to convey the idea that the citizens had confidence in their Council as a whole. Of course, his candidature was never seriously taken. I refer to the election for the Mayor of the city. It was never seriously enter- tained, and the citizens of Wellington recorded their views on the matter by returning his opponent by a two-to-one majority, with 337 votes to spare. A friend of mine overheard a conversation between two working-men subse- quently to the declaration of the poll, and it was something like this : One man said to the other, " What do you think of Wilford's can- didature ? " His friend said, " I did not think he ever had a chance." "Oh, no," said the other, " he is all right for Parliament, but he  is hardly the thing for Mayor," which is a striking commentary on several things. But that expression adequately describes the general view held of the honourable gentleman's can- didature by the citizens of Wellington when he aspired to the position of Mayor. Now, the honourable gentleman asked the question in his speech, " Why did not Wellington seek to acquire a hundred acres for recreation-grounds only ? " Mr. WILFORD .- Two hundred acres. Mr. HUTCHESON .- "Two hundred acres." Very well. This Bill that I have the honour now to be in charge of is a most striking proof of the bona fides of the City of Wel- lington, inasmuch as it defines clearly and succinctly the proposal it is afterwards sought to submit to the people. They have here a definite proposal which cannot be de- viated from, and upon which they are com- pelled to directly appeal to the ratepayers of this city ; and I say that if there was not any- thing further that could be adduced in proof of bona fi les it is the very presence of this Bill. Now, I would like to take notice of one or two things which my colleague, Mr. Fisher, said in the course of his speech, which, of course, was laden with denunciation of the City Council and the Mayor. This honourable House and the citizens of Wellington can judge for them- selves the reasons for the honourable gentle- man's peculiar action in connection with so many of our local Bills. He told the House that he called at the City Council Chambers and was unable to procure this year's balance- sheet. He explained to this House that a copy of the balance-sheet for the year 1900 was the most recent reliable record he could get. Mr. FISHER. - March, 1900. Mr. HUTCHESON .- Sir, it is only right that I should inform this House that the balance-sheet of the Wellington City Corpora- tion for the year ending the 31st March, 1901. was prepared and ready for public audit in the first week in April, but that feat was only ac- complished at the sacrifice of the services of every member of the municipal staff. It meant working night and day to get the accounts balanced; and the reason that a properly cer- tified and audited balance-sheet was not avail- able to the public admits of the simplest explanation. I unhesitatingly affirm that the balance-sheet was prepared and ready for the public auditor in the first week in April; and that fact was intimated to the Controller and Auditor-General, and the reply received was that the officer whose duty it was to do this. service had received leave of absence for two months. That, in short, is the reason. But at the same time let me inform the House that a synopsis of the position of the city's affairs was available, and printed and ready for distribu- tion amongst the citizens at that date. There was no attempt at concealment, nor yet any laxity in the preparation of the balance-sheet. Now, Mr. Fisher also repeated that dreary in- vective against unfortunate Wellington-" Look at the streets." Sir, surely it is simple logic to say that the present bad state of the streets. cannot be charged to the present City Council. It is surely owing to the neglect of past Coun- cils ; and the honourable gentleman has in the past been intimately connected with the affairs of this city, and I ask him what has he done in the capacity of Mayor or Councillor to improve the streets of the City of Wellington ? There can be no record found of any attempt of his to deal with this question of the improvement of our streets. This present Council, for the first time in the history of the city, has sub- mitted to a successful poll of the people a large, and comprehensive, and scientific pro- posal for the improvement of the streets of the City of Wellington. But this I do say : that had the City Council in the past had a little more starch they would have " chanced the ducks," and said to the owners of property abutting the streets, " We shall pave your half of the pavement and charge it to you," and not leave it at the option of private-property owners. That is the principal cause of the foot- paths of the City of Wellington being in their present state of disrepair. Now, I will pass with very little comment to the ungenerous reference made by the honourable member (Mr. Fisher) to Mr. H. D. Bell, and his connection with the public affairs of this city. I say, Sir, of my own personal knowledge, that there is. scarcely any other man in the whole City of Wellington who has more unostentatiously and more self-sacrificingly given his best thoughts, and his best knowledge, and his best services to. the City of Wellington than Mr. H. D. Bell. To Mr. Bell, in the first instance, must be 
<page:186>
attributed whatever credit may be due for the satisfactory settlement between the two local governing bodies in this city as set forth speci- fically in the deed of agreement embodied in the Bill called the Wellington Harbour Board and City of Wellington Empowering Act, which enabled that interchange of endowments, and en- abled the sweeping-away of the slums, and en- abled a satisfactory solution of what was really a difficult problem. I say to Mr. H. D. Bell be- longs the credit wholly and solely for the initiative idea embodied in these enactments. These and many other services of a solid character of which the public are scarcely cognisant, and for which he has never got public credit, Mr. H. D. Bell is the author. And, above all other members of this House, I think it comes with ill grace in- deed for my colleague the honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) to malign in any way Mr. H. D. Bell. Now. Sir, as to the Bill, all I have time to say is that a proposal must be submitted to the people. If it is not a proposal to raise a straight-out loan of $75,000, then it is an alternative proposal that the City Council be empowered to raise, under this deed of agreement, a present loan to redeem the mortgage of ¥10,000, which the Corporation will require to liquidate at once, the balance of the purchase-money, amounting to £65,000, to re- main till the 1st day of January, 1905, at a rate of interest of $2 10s. per centum per annum ; so that by that time the City Council may be deriving some revenue from the leasing of a portion of the recreation-ground, and be in  a better position to raise the necessary loan to discharge the liability. I say, Sir, that in the 400) acres now at the disposal of the citizens of Wellington, we have the least advantage that will accrue from the passing of this Bill, and we have 1,100 acres that will be available as building - sites for the working - people of this town, so that under municipal control we may arrive at a solution of the question of the housing of the poor of the city. Not only will it not impose a single penny of taxation or rates on the people of Wellington, but in the imme- diate vicinity of the city we will have a glorious recreation-ground, over every inch of which, with the exception of fifteen days in the year, the people of Wellington will be able to roam at. will. Sir, I submit the Bill with every con fidence to the House, and now move the second reading. Mr. WILFORD (Wellington Suburbs) .- Sir, may I be allowed to trespass on the time of the House for a moment to make a personal ex- planation ? The honourable member for Wel- lington City (Mr. Hutcheson) produced from a file of a newspaper a letter in which he charged me with a certain mistake, which he alleged was made by myself. I often make mistakes- I admit it-but this particular mistake with which he charges me I never made. I believe the letter was written by himself. I am credibly informed that he wrote it. and signed it over a nom de plume, and I understand it was written by him to help Mr. Aitken against me. Fur. thermore, the honourable member's inventive genius is well known, as is his personal animus Mlr. Hutcheson to myself; but I feel certain that when he cackles against me in the future he will have to roost a little higher, when he will be out of the wet. Mr. HUTCHESON. - Sir, I think I should be allowed to disclaim the authorship of the letter, portion of which I read just now. I know nothing at all of the authorship of it, and, as for the honourable member's covert threat, I simply treat it with contempt, as it deserves. Mr. WILFORD .- Sir, may I be allowed to say -- Mr. SPEAKER. - No ; I cannot hear any moro personal explanations. The House divided. AYES, 37. Rhodes Arnold Houston Lang Russell, G. W.

Bill ordered to be read a second time this day six months. LIBEL BILL (No. 1). Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) .- In moving the second reading of this Bill I did intend, in my introductory remarks, to call attention to the extraordinary state of the law of libel as disclosed in the decision of the Court of Appeal in the Mabin case. I am glad to see that the Government has undertaken to make good the defect of the law in respect to the protection of the citizens of this country from injury result- ing from libellous statements made by private persons or by newspapers. Formerly the news- papers of the country were held in check not so much by the fear of civil proceedings, but by the dread of their editors or proprietors being prosecuted criminally for offences of this kind. The right to prosecute criminally is to be restored, and the action of the Govern- ment in that regard will be applauded by all respectable people in this country. Sir, I come now to deal with the Bill which I have introduced for the purpose of amend ng the law of libel in the direction of affording greater protection to the citizens of New Zea- land. Under the existing law ample protection is afforded to the proprietors of newspapers, but sufficient protection is not afforded to the citizens of the State. And yet attempts are made year after year to strengthen the power of the Press by giving increased facilities for attacking reputable citizens and securing to them an immunity from all punishment. In politics the policy of the journals of this country is shaped by the monetary power and the social influence of the persons who support them. In other respects they are, as the late Judge Richmond once described them-refer- ring more particularly to the Wellington news- papers-merely advertising sheets. I remem- ber him saying on one occasion, from the Supreme Court bench, that if one wished to see how his character was pourtrayed by the Wellington newspapers he had only to look into the concave side of a tablespoon. If this be the opinion of an eminent jurist, such as the late Judge Richmond unquestionably was, may not the lesser lights be entitled to enter- tain similar opinions. One would not so much object to what the Press did or said if our jour- nalism was of such a high standard as that of England or Australia. In those countries editorial comment is argumentative and re- spectful. But we have no such standard of journalism in Zew Zealand ; at least, I qualify that by saying that we have no such standard in the City of Wellington. Now, this Bill is extremely simple in its provisions, and that man will be hard to please who finds fault with what it contains. The honourable member for the Taieri, who introduces annually the Bill presented to Parliament in the interests of the newspaper Press of the colony, says the exist- ing law in New Zealand is thirteen years behind the libel law of England. The answer to this is simple. In the first place, the libel law of England is a law which is not satisfactory to the people of England. It was passed in the English House of Commons in 1888- thirteen years ago, under great pressure brought to bear from journalistic and other sources. It really was a London Metropolitan Libel Bill. In the annals of the House of Commons such pressure was never known to be exercised in regard to any measure ever passed by that il- lustrious body. But soon after the Bill became law the English people discovered what a terrible power had been placed in the hands of the Press. So strong was the revulsion of feel- ing on the part of the people that year after year efforts have been made, in every session of the House of Commons since the year 1890, to secure the repeal of that Act. The first Bill to repeal the Act was moved by Sir A. Borthwick, an eminent member of the House of Commons. The next attempt, in the succeeding year, was made by Sir Albert Rollitt, solicitor to the Provincial Newspaper Association, which represents upwards of six hundred of the provincial journals of Great Britain. And repeal Bills have been introduced in every succeeding year, as the English Hansard, which is to be found in our own library, shows. And if the repeal of the English libel law is moved for by such eminent men as Sir A. Borthwick and Sir A. Rollitt, is it reasonable that attempts should be made to introduce into this country a law the abrogation of which is so strongly desired by the great mass of the English people ? I think that very conclusively disposes of the argument that we are thirteen years behind the libel law of England. Now, Sir, the Bill introduced last year, by the mem- ber for the Taieri, was defeated on division by twenty-three votes to twenty. There was a full and exhaustive discussion on the Bill, as there had been the previous year, and that division conveys the deliberate opinion of the House in regard to Mr. Carncross's Bill. In introducing the Bill last year Mr. Carncross said :- "It may not be generally known to some members that a newspaper proprietor may in all good faith send his reporter to report the proceedings of the Supreme Court or Magis- trate's Court, and the reporter in all good faith takes down of what is uttered there an accu- rate and fair account of the proceedings of the Court, and yet the newspaper proprietor is liable to an action for libel, although his report is fair and accurate. I say this is an injustico under which the Press of New Zealand should not be allowed to labour." There is something to be said in favour of the contention that a newspaper proprietor should 
<page:188>
not be punished for publishing an accurate and fair account of the proceedings of the Court ; but suppose in place of an accurate and fair account of the proceedings of the Court, a newspaper publishes a garbled and distorted account of the proceedings of any Court, what is to happen then ? Suppose a newspaper pub- lishes a mangled report of the proceedings in some case which would be highly injurious to a private person, and, in the case of a public man, would wholly damm his future career. What is to be the remedy in such a case? This Bill provides a speedy and simple remedy. Now, here is a case in which I myself was concerned. It was heard in the Magistrate's Court at Wel- lington, and in a telegraphed account of the caso which appeared in the Christchurch Press next day is contained the statement, given as part of the evidence, that I had given my mem- ber's railway-pass to a woman of immoral character. An Hon. MEMBER .- What ? . Mr. FISHER ..- The Christchurch Press of the 27th February, in a telegraphed report of a case in which I was concerned in the Stipendiary Magistrate's Court in Wellington, contains a statement, purporting to be part of the evi- dence given in the case, that I had given my member's railway-pass to a woman of immoral character. The local papers, in their report of the case, contained no such statement, and one may be assured that it would have appeared there if such a statement had been made. I also asked the Magistrate and the Court officials if they remembered such a statement having been made, but none of them remem- bered any such statement having been made. Now, I stand on the floor of this House and ask this question : If a member of this House were proved guilty of such an act what punishment ought to be awarded to him ? Again I say, if a person were proved guilty of printing and cir- culating such an abominable statement what punishment ought to be awarded to him? On the face of it the statement is absurd, for what woman, moral or immoral, could make use of a member's pass? Now, this paper, the Christ- church Press, is, next to the Evening Post of Wellington, the paper which clamours loudest for an amendment of the law of libel in the direction of affording them greater protection. Could the farce of impudence any further go ? Sir, it may be asked why I did not bring an action for libel against the Christchurch Press. This is my answer : I have said in this House on many occasions,- not only in connection with Libel Bills, but in connection with questions of privilege which have been brought up in the House, -- that nothing would in- duce me to become a party to a libel suit, for the uniform experience of libel actions is that the next to being the loser is to be the winner. On the 3rd July. 1891, speaking on a question of privilege in this House, I said, -- " If I had chosen to take proceedings against newspapers which have attacked me, as many of them have done, in a most ruffainly and blackguard manner, I should have some of the Wellington editors before the bar every week. Nr. Fisher If I had chosen I might have had many of them in prison for criminal libel. But, Sir, the best way is to treat them with silent con- tempt, and leave them to the reprobation of all honest men. That is my own course. I would never go to law with a newspaper, no matter what it said-and I have had some rough things said of me; and it is because that is the course I have adopted in my own case that I recommend the House to adopt it now." I have spoken of the attempts made by Sir A. Borthwick and Sir Albert Rollitt to repeal the libel law of England. What force is there, then, in the statement of the honourable mem- ber for the Taieri that his Bill is a transcript of the English Act? I repeat that if it be a transcript of the English Act it is a transcript of an Act which the people of England have made repeated attempts to repeal. And, in the face of these persistent and consistent attempts in the House of Commons to repeal that Act, why should we pass a law through our Parlia- ment in order that we may have the pleasure of following the course of the House of Com- mons as to its repeal? Let us take the precaution of not putting the Act on our statute- book. Then we shall be safe. I have shown that the newspapers of this colony require no protection beyond the protection they already have; and that protection is un- doubtedly great. I showed last year what enormous profits are made by these par- ticular newspapers which rave and crave for a new libel law. But, supposing they lost one libel action a year, could not either of these newspapers-these two champions of journalistic freedom, the Christchurch Press and the Wellington Evening Post-well afford to pay a thousand pounds a year? I have referred to one case of libel in which I myself was concerned. Undoubtedly, in the case of the Christchurch Press I could have prosecuted the editor of that paper criminally, but I have given the House the reason why I took no action in the matter. But here is a case which strikes this Parliament nearer home. It strikes not at the individual, but at the very root of the honour and the independence of the Parliament itself. This House prorogued on the 20th of October last year, and within five days of the prorogation there appeared in nearly all the newspapers of the colony this scandalous article. To show how widespread has been the dissemina- tion of this nauseous news, I take this version of the article from the Dunedin Evening Star, published on the 25th October, 1900. The Star introduces the matter in this way : "The Manawatu Standard, edited by Mr. F. Pirani, M.H.R., contains the following editorial state- ments in a recent issue" :- " Those who feel any respect for representative institutions cannot but regard the result of the session of Parliament just concluded with loathing and disgust. It is well to speak plainly, and therefore we can say with truth that a depth of degradation has been sounded which is unrivalled in the annals of New Zealand, and both Chambers are equally blameworthy," --- Formerly the Evening Post confined its attacks 
<page:189>
to this Chamber, but this article from the Manauatu Standard boldly slanders both Chambers-"although the most flagrant in- stances were exhibited in the Lower Chamber. Drunkenness was always in evidence, and was not looked upon as any offence by the majority of members, while in one case at least it was openly encouraged by the Premier." Now, that is slander of a personal charac- ter. The allegation affects only the conduct of individual members of the House. But what pain it must give to members of this honour- able Assembly, Sir, over which you have pre- sided for such a great number of years with such honour to yourself and to the Parliament, to have statements such as these sown broad- cast throughout this country, and carried on the wings of the wind to countries far and near. It is deplorable that such a stigma should be applied to members of this House without refutation, and adequate punishment being applied. But the article goes further, and becomes more serious still. It proceeds, -- "This was bad enough, in all conscience, but what we regard as a good deal worse was the open manner in which persuasion was used and bribes offered to facilitate the passage of objectionable legislation." This, I hold, is a wilful and deliberate libel upon the Parliament as a whole, and the Parlia- ment, as a Parliament, will not be true to itself if it does not deal with the author of this article in some manner befitting the seriousness of the offence. Then, the article goes on to say, - " The bribe we refer to was the voting of £40 each extra for members as sessional expenses, conditional upon the extra salaries to the Go- vernor and the Ministers being voted, and the Public Revenues Bill, which is a menace to representative government, being placed upon the statute-book. The persuasion was utilised to get members out of the way who were against Government subsidies to private indus- trial schools, so that the final vote would be in favour of the Government. This was particu- larly marked in the Lower House, but much more so in the Legislative Council, where members, some of whom are usually opposed to the Government, actually remained outside of the Chamber, so that their votes should not be cast in the direction they had been given twice previously during the week. We have only touched on the fringe of the degradation of our parliamentary institutions, but that small peep at political methods is surely enough to make honourable men recoil from the spectacle with disgust." Will any member of this House tell me-will any member of this House tell you, Sir-will any member of this House tell the people of this country -- that he approves of such slanderous statements being circulated throughout the country, Sir, with the palpable object of sully- ing the good name and fair fame of this Parlia- ment ? It is greatly to be regretted that the Go- vernment do not themselves move in the matter, for the honour of the House is in their keeping ; and it is demanded that members of this House I should in some manner be protected from such infamous slanders. There were Parliaments in 8.30. past days which dealt with this scurril- ous literature and with the blackguards who wrote it in the way in which I hold this Parliament should deal with it now. I will give the House an illustration of what a former Parliament did in the case of a member who had cast disgraceful aspersions on the character of his brother members, and on the character of the House as a whole. On the 26th Septem- ber, 1876, an article similar in character to that which appeared in the Manawatu Standard, and written on these very same identical subjects, was printed in the Timaru Herald. Mr. Lar- nach brought the matter before the House on the 29th September as a question of privilege. This is the extract from Hansard, Vol. 22 :- "The CLERK then read the following extracts from the Timaru Herald :- "' When the present session of Parliament opened, we congratulated the colony on the high character of the new House, as exemplified by the ability and independence of the members. At the same time, we deprecated too great con- fidence in the permanency of that satisfactory state of things, pointing out that every evil in- fluence would be brought to bear in order to render the House, if not corrupt, at least cor- ruptible. The results have justified our caution only too completely ; for we find that, after a sitting of three months, a large proportion of the members are not to be relied on to act with rectitude in any matter involving their personal interests. We fear that we should not be over- stating the fact were we to state that at this moment a majority of the House might easily be purchased. The paltry conduct of members in voting themselves free passes on the railways, and compelling the Government to increase the honorarium. cannot but have shaken the public confidence in their integrity, and seriously dam- aged the reputation of the Legislature. Men who could not agree on any one of the large political questions which are now convulsing the colony, who never once made a real attempt, by mutual concessions, to further the public busi- ness, yet banded themselves together with the greatest cordiality in order to satisfy their selfish greed."". Again,- "' It appears that, long before even a rumour got abroad of any intention to demand an in- crease of the honorarium, a ring had been formed among the meanest and most con- temptible members, who, working steadily and secretly in all directions, making all sort of promises, and offering all sorts of threats, con- trived, before the "plant " was " blown on," as professional thieves would say, to secure the support of a very formidable section of the House. They then appealed to some of the leaders, and gave it out that they had a ma- jority, which, of course, made the matter a party question ; and finally they got a wealthy and independent member, who could not be sus- pected of any personal interest in the matter, to bring down a resolution to the House con- taining their unworthy proposal."" 
<page:190>
Again,- " The most dangerous feature of the com- promise is that it encourages an unscrupulous ring to carry on similar enterprises in the future ; for they will doubtless recognise that by demanding more than they expected to get, they have, at all events, got more than was their due. It is indeed to be regretted that the first session of the new Parliament should have been disgraced by this scandalous affair ; and we trust that those members who have a respect not only for themselves but also for the insti- tutions of the country will nerve themselves to resist, by every means in their power, a repeti- tion of such practices. We publish elsewhere a list of the members who pledged themselves to support the increase to $300; and our readers will probably agree with us that polities bring men into strange company." " That article was by vote of the House de- clared to be a breach of privilege. Mr. SEDDON .- The House was sitting when that occurred. Mr. FISHER .- Yes, it was. The present Go- vernment are therefore in this case absolved to that extent ; but, still, I hold that the publication of this article constitutes a breach of privilege, and the Government, in all honour, should move Again, at a later stage the in the matter. Clerk read another extract in connection with another charge against the member for Geral- dine (Mr. E. Wakefield), the author of the article This is part of the second article :- ". The other evening Mr. Joyce,-whom with- out any disrespect we may class among the very lowest members of the House, - in the course of the debate on the report of the Rabbit Nuisance   Committee, made an extraordinary and very brutal statement. He said that he regarded the rabbits as the greatest blessing in the country, because they were ruining the squatters! The ignorant, prejudiced ruffian probably did not recognise that the ruin of the squatters meant the depreciation of the value of property, and a general depression in trade, including his own, which, we understand, is that of a publican. A coarse boor like Mr. Joyce might be excused for such a sentiment, for he knew not what he did.'" That article also was declared to be a breach of the privileges of the House, and then came later in the day the abject apology of Mr. Wakefield (Hansard, Volume 22, p. 623), who had written of his brother members in this dis- graceful strain ; but I will not read the whole of the apology-in fact, I need not read any part of it. It was described in a subsequent debate by a namesake of mine, Mr. J. T. Fisher, a member of the House, in a peculiar phrase, which, I confess, is not too refined. He said he had never seen such a revolting scene as when Mr. Wakefield crawled along the floor of the House on his belly. After the resolution con- suring Mr. Wakefield had been arrived at, Mr. Speaker Fitzherbert, addressing Mr. Wakefield after he was called in, said :-- "I have to inform you that the House, having taken into its consideration the explana- tion, apology, and retractation which you have Mir. Fisher made, regard them as ample, and, in a spirit of generosity which appears to me to do this House infinite credit, accepts your apology, and finally disposes of the question." Then this hypocrite, who had so lampooned and caricatured and reviled his brother mem- bers, used this canting language: - "Mr. WAKEFIELD .- In a spirit of the very fullest consideration for the position I hold in this House, I desire to express my sincere thanks for the great consideration which this House has accorded me. No one could be in a more difficult position than I was as a journalist and at the same time a member of this House." What does it matter whether he was a member of the House or not ? The question is, Is a member of the House justified in slan- dering his fellow-members in this manner, and is the author of this article in the Vanaratu Standard justified in slandering his fellow- members in the language I have read to the House ? Mr. Wakefield continued,- "I did my best to-night to express my high respect for the position I hold as a member of this House, and which every member holds as a member of this House, and I can only say the treatment I have received is such as to place this House in the highest possible place in the opinion and credit of the public of the colony. I desire to offer my sincere thanks to you, Sir, and to every member of this House, for the extremely considerate and impartial manner in which they have treated me in regard to this matter." And so the episode ended. Now, I claim, as one member of this House, that it is time the Government stepped in and took some steps to put an end to this disgraceful form of criticism of l'arliament and its members. I will now briefly review the clauses of the Bill. When giving evidence in the House of Commons on the English Libel Bill-which the honourable member for the Taieri wishes us to adopt-Sir Albert Rollit was asked this question :- "Can you suggest any means of protecting or compensating a person who might feel him- self aggrieved by the introduction of any matter in a newspaper report ?- I think there ought to be protective provision, and that he ought to have the right, as speedily as possible, to have inserted, in a prominent part of the paper (quite as prominent as that in which the attack upon him occurred) an explanation or contra- diction, without the addition of any unfair editorial note or comment." Now, Sir, I have literally followed the direc- tion of Sir Albert Rollit. His exact language is followed in this clause :- Clause 3. " (1.) Wherever there is published in any newspaper any statement which in- juriously affects the character. reputation, or commercial interests of any person, the pro- prietor of such newspaper shall, on the re- quest of the person so injuriously affected, within two days after such request, or, if such paper is not issued daily, then in the next succeeding issue of such newspaper, publish in such newspaper such reasonable answer, denial, or explanation as the person so affected demands. 
<page:191>
"(2.) Such answer, denial, or explanation shall be published in a part of such newspaper as prominent and in type as conspicuous as that in which the statement complained of appeared. "(3.) If the proprietor of such newspaper re- fuses or neglects to publish any such answer, denial, or explanation within the time and in the manner herein specified, he shall be liable to a penalty of not less than ten pounds and not more than fifty pounds." Clause 4 of the Bill relates to reports of pro- ceedings in camera-and we had some criticism of a very opposite kind upon this very point during the discussion on the Divorce Bill last evening. The clause is as follows :- "4. (1.) Whenever in the public interests any proceedings in any Court are ordered by the Court to be heard in camera, it shall not be lawful for the proprietor of any newspaper to publish any report or comment on such pro- ceedings other than the fact or to the effect that such proceedings were so heard in camera." Subsection (2) says,- " The proprietor of any newspaper contra- vening the provisions of this section shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding fifty pounds." Then there is another clause, clause 5, which is the last clause of the Bill. It relates to the disclosing of the name of the writer of any defamatory letter. Clause 5 says,- " In any action against the proprietor of a newspaper in respect of the publication of a  libel contained in or purporting to be contained in a letter from a correspondent to such news- paper, the defendant, or each of the defendants, if there be more than one, shall. on application to the Court in that behalf, disclose on affidavit the true name and address of such correspon- dent, whereupon such defendant shall be freed from all liability in respect of such libel other than the liability to pay such costs of action as may be awarded against him by the Court." I would like to ask in the most dispassionate way whether any member of the House sees anything to object to in that clause ? In fact, my remarks applies to the whole Bill. I ask if any honourable member sees anything in the whole Bill to object to? I have read the whole of the Bill to the House. It is contained in clauses 3, 4, and 5. Sir, the chief merit of the Bill is this : it puts an end to all actions for libel. If the proprietor or editor of a news- paper refuses to publish an explanation of any defamatory or injurious statement made in the columns of his paper, then he is liable to the penalty which is prescribed in this Bill. The case is heard before a Magistrate ; there is no writ issued ; there are lawyers emploved ; there is no waiting for three months for the sitting of the Supreme Court ; no jurors are summoned ; there is no commotion of any kind ; no anxiety of mind on the part of the suitor or suitors. There is the simple hearing before the Magis- trate, and the defendant is fined or he is not fined, and there is an end of the matter. If this Bill was passed with these three simple clauses there would be no such thing in this country as an action for libel. A case could be | I am as certain of a seat in this House as any brought in the simplest possible form before any Magistrate in the country. The case is heard as an ordinary case is heard in the Stipendiary Magistrate's Court, and there is an end of the business. There are no large lawyer's fees to pay ; there is no long string of witnesses ; the plaintiff, or the defendant, is not subject to three months' anxiety of mind in waiting for the sitting of the Court ; there is no raking up of evidence in all parts of the country ; there is no diving into the history of this or that witness. The whole thing is determined in one sitting, and no more is heard of the action, and so the newspapers would be free from the dread of blackmail being levied on them. The plaintiff against a newspaper would have a speedy remedy at small cost. I do not know that any person, however litigious, how- ever his desire to dabble in law, could desire anything more than the simple provisions con- tained in this Bill. Sir, I deplore that public men should be attacked in this way. I deplore that the Parliament of the country should be attacked in this way ; but I say there is a simple remedy. But where an individual member of the House is powerless to move, the Govern- ment is not powerless. It is open to them, if they think fit, to pass an Act to put an end to this species of attack on members of Parlia- ment, or on the Parliament as a whole. There was a summary means adopted in past years in this House which made the gentlemen in the Press gallery extremely careful of their pro- fessional conduct. I remember three instances when I was engaged in that gallery in which the Speaker, in the exercise of his unquestioned authority, gave an order, on separate occasions, that three reporters, who had written scurrilous reports, should not be allowed within the pre- cinets of the Parliamentary Buildings I need not give their names. I worked with them all. The penalty meted out to them was well de- served. It was a penalty that ought to have been meted out to every man who so misuses his position in that gallery as to give way to his feelings of pique, his feelings of resentment, envy, and hatred, toward men who occupy posi- tions in this House. A reporter has no right to slander members in the public journals of the country. Of course, our characters amongst our constituents are proof against such mis- representations. For instance, the member for Ashburton was slandered, as he told us last session, by some villainous fellow connected with some journal in his district. But there is the simple answer that the honourable mem- ber is known to his constituents. What need he care what the newspapers say of him so long as his constituents, knowing his strength and his weaknesses, his virtues and his faults, are content Parliament after Parliament to return him to this House ? And so in the case of these two journals in Wellington -- which are considered by some to be all - powerful - what does it matter what they say of me? I am returned to this House election after election. time after time. Anything said by these papers has not the least effect upon me.

member who is here to-day. I am told at every election that I will not be elected, that I have no chance. The tale is somewhat musty. Always wait till the numbers go up, then there is consternation and grief among all my op- ponents. They are a sorrowing band, who would gladly like to see me rejected. But, Sir, I am of the people ; I have lived here for thirty-two years, and have spent all I have earned amongst them ; I am one of them, and they know it. And so I conclude my speech by saying, as I said in this House last session, that as long as Cieorge Fisher has two legs to walk upon there is a seat for him in this Parliament. Mr. WILLIS (Wanganui) .- I think, Sir, it is necessary that a few words should be said re- garding this Bill. I am one of those who de- cidedly dissent from newspapers being allowed in any possible way to use language against in- dividuals which they are not justified in using. But, Sir, I do not consider that by passing this Bill is the way in which we are to overcome those difficulties. I will take, first, clause 3 of the Bill. It says,- " Wherever there is published in any news- paper any statement which injuriously affects the character, reputation, or commercial in- terests of any person." Et cetera. Now, in the first place, who is to be the judge of this? There is no mention in the Bill of who is to say whether the statement has injuriously affected the character or reputa- tion of the person attacked, and I should say, myself, that that would be one of the most important points in the Bill. If the newspaper has made a statement there must be some means surely by which it can be decided whether   that does injuriously affect the character of any person. Is it to be left to any individual who fancies he has been attacked? Is he to go to the newspaper and demand that immediately his reply shall be inserted, no matter what the reply may be, and the newspaper has got to insert it under a penalty of a sum not exceed- ing €50? Such a clause as this is simply absurd. The only thing that astonishes me is that the honourable member for Wellington City, with his experience. should ever have put such a clause in a Bill of this kind. Then, it says further on, in clause 3, "If the proprietor of such newspaper refuses or neglects to publish any such answer, denial, or explanation " he shall be liable to a penalty up to $50. Well, the inference is that any answer can be de- manded to be put in that the person who imagines himself aggrieved chooses. It is left to the person who imagines that he is attacked to say whether it affects his charac- ter, his reputation, or his commercial interest. Then, there are those words " commercial interests." We shall find articles in papers that may in a variety of ways affect the commercial interests of people, and yet they are not libellous. Any one who is acquainted with the newspapers at all knows that no matter what trivial statements may be put in people will from time to time fancy they have a griev- ance. No matter how true or how justitied the newspapers may have been in inserting those Mr Fisher statements, you will always find people who think they have good grounds for an action for libel against the proprietor ; and I know in many cases the people attacked have richly deserved what they got. Sir, this Bill actually provides that the person supposed to have been attacked has the right to say, " I have been at- tacked, and you must insert my answer in the same type as you have used in printing your leading article, otherwise you are liable to a penalty of £50." That is a bright specimen of legislation for this House to pass. Then, I will go a little further, and I say clause 5 is equally as bad as the other one. Clause 5 says,- "In any action against the proprietor of a newspaper in respect of the publication of a libel contained in or purporting to be contained in a letter from a correspondent to such news- paper, the defendant, or each of the defendants if there be more than one, shall, on application to the Court in that behalf, disclose on affidavit the true name and address of such correspondent, whereupon such defendant shall be freed from all liability in respect of such libel other than the liability to pay such costs of action as may be awarded against him by the Court." What does this mean ? Suppose some un- scrupulous newspaper-I do not say that un- scrupulous newspapers in this country are common, because, as a rule, I believe most of the newspapers are well regulated-but suppose there was such a case, where a news- paper published a scandalous attack upon some particular individual, and suppose the person who inserts the correspondence is worth no- thing, all he has got to do is, by arrangement with the newspaper proprietor, to have a libel- lous letter inserted reflecting against some par- ticular person or company, and when afterwards the aggrieved persons take action the newspaper proprietor coolly turns round and says, " You shall have the name of the writer," and then all he can be compelled to do is to be made liable for the costs of the Court, and the man who has been libelled comes back on the man who has supplied the libel, only to find that he is a man of straw. He therefore gets nothing. That will be the effect of clause 5. It is only right that there should be some debate on this Bill, because I am quite satis- fied it should not be allowed to pass. I cannot imagine for a moment the members of the House allowing a Bill of this kind to get on to the statute-book : The Bill wants altering. "lock, stock, and barrel." In fact, to be effective, a new measure is wanted of an entirely different character. All the clauses should be knocked out, and then the honour- able member who introduced the Bill is wel- come to what remains. Mr. T. MACKENZIE (Waihemo) .- There is no doubt that from time to time political men get hauled over the coals by the Press, and in the majority of instances they, in my opinion, deserve the severe treatment they receive, but not perhaps to the extent referred to by the honourable gentleman in his introductory re- marks. On the whole, I consider that the Press of this colony are well conducted, but occasion- 
<page:193>
ally one finds some scurrilous men who abuse their positions. I am not going to show why I consider this measure unworkable, and I am surprised that such a measure should have emanated from a member who is always making loud protestations of Liberalism. I maintain that the whole of the Press of the colony should not be put under an Act of this description because of the improper conduct of some of the smaller papers in the country districts. I suppose that when I first entered political life I was as roughly handled by the Press as any politician could possibly be, but in time we get used to that sort of thing, and do not mind it. After all, the public are the judges, and the Press has not that influence in forming public opinion that it had years ago when the population of the country was less educated than it is at present. I now come to the clauses that have been re- ferred to by the honourable member for Wanga- nui, and he pointed out that if a newspaper pub- lished an article injurious to any individual or company it at once comes under the provisions of this Act. Now, in connection with the work I was engaged on in the Old Country, the news- papers of this colony are at present unable to place before the public information that they ought to have and which I gave in this House. That information would be injurious to the com- mercial interests of many individuals, but if it were published in the Press, as it ought to be, the best interests of the producer of this coun- try would be served. It is much to be regretted that our newspapers do not now possess the right to publish this in the fullest manner possible. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL. - Will you guarantee its accuracy ? Mr. T. MACKENZIE. - It can easily be guaranteed, but the greater the truth the greater the libel. Does my honourable friend the professor of political economy and consti- tutional history deny that if a statement is published, however true it may be, the pub- lisher is liable for damages if it is injurious to the interests of individuals ? Mr. BARCLAY .- Yes. 9.0. Mr. T. MACKENZIE .-- There you are : he acknowledges it. Mr. BARCLAY .- No. Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- Then what does the honourable gentleman mean ? He might be called, like Sir George Reid, of New South Wales, the "Yes-No" member. I think, in connection at any rate with commercial sub- jects, the Press ought to possess greater liberty than they do now. Then, we have this precious clause 5, where the writer to a paper must give his signature. I pity numbers of correspondents if their names were given. We should not have many valuable opinions of some of our friends' political actions nor the actions of Governments if names had to be given. Not only would they suffer from damages in Courts of law, but they would be dismissed from their situations, which is a much more serious thing than being merely brought before a Court for damages. Alto- gether, I consider the measure is not required, and I hope to see the House throw out its second reading. VOL. CXVII .- 12. Mr. COLLINS (Christchurch City) .- I do not intend to detain the House in discussing this matter, but I am bound to say I shall oppose the second reading of the Bill, because I think it would be an evil day for New Zealand if we were to attempt to muzzle the Press be- cause any politician may feel himself aggrieved by the nature of the criticisms that have been levelled against him or the House. I recognise, as fully as the honourable gentleman who gave us his annual and eloquent speech, that very frequently the columns of the Press do contain criticisms, the nature of which every right- thinking person must deplore ; but it is infi- nitely better that these extravagant criticisms should appear than that we should in any sense curtail the freedom of the Press and prevent it having the opportunity of freely criticizing those who claim to represent the public. I would remind the honourable gentleman that from his own standpoint he is scarcely logical in asking that such a Bill should be passed, for he has already assured us that he has in no sense suffered from the criticisms that have been levelled against him. Indeed, he tells us that whatever the papers may say, and in spite of all they have said, he continues to retain the gene- ral confidence of the people of the city he re- presents. That being so, why complain of the criticisms? They may be unfair or unjust ; but, granting all that, the public man who bei 3 subject to them can come out of them an- touched and unscathed is all the better man for the fact of the criticisms ; and I undertake to say the average politician, however much he may regret being subjected to severe criticisms of this character-even to those of an unfair character-that he himself comes out strength- ened and purified from the criticism, for if his character be above reproach, if the criticisms are unfair, he simply draws public attention to the fact that they in no way impeach his cha- racter as a public representative. Apart from the public character of this Bill and the effect it would be likely to have on the public spirit of the people's representatives, as well as on the Press, the Bill would be inoperative if passed into law. Let me point out to the bonourable gentleman that subsection (3) of clause 3 says,- " If the proprietor of such newspaper refuses or neglects to publish any such answer, denial, or explanation within the time and in the man- ner herein specified, he shall be liable to a pen- alty of not less than ten pounds and not more than fifty pounds." But, Sir, there is no means of recovering that. How are you going to get that €50? Would he ask the newspaper proprietor to hand over $50? and if the newspaper proprietor refuses, how is he going to get it ? The honourable gentleman might be able to "take it out," but I could not. A clause of that kind would be surely quite inoperative. As a matter of fact, there is nothing in the Bill to give effect to its provisions. Even if we pass the Bill it will be absolutely and entirely inoperative. I do not, however, regret that a little time should be taken up in discuss- ing the Bill. I invariably listen to the honour- 
<page:194>
He always rivets the attention of the House as he speaks upon any matter. I do not regret the time spent upon it, and particularly will I not regret it if, as a result of the discussions that tako place from time to time on this question, it should call the attention of the Press itself to the necessity of at least criticizing public men in a fair, impartial, and just manner in the interests of the public and in the interests of public affairs. If that is so, then much good will be done ; and, as far as the individual is con- cerned, the honourable gentleman declares that he has not suffered-he has lost nothing, has suffered nothing ; and, that being so, I fail to understand why he should want this Bill passed into law. Mr. BARCLAY (Dunedin City) .- It was not my intention, Sir, to say anything when this Bill was introduced by the honourable member to-night, but some things that have fallen from the honourable member for Waihemo and the honourable member for Christchurch City in opposition to the Bill seem to me to require This seems to me such a Bill as some notice. the House would be very willing to accept and to carry. From the " Aves " that arose when the honourable member had finished his speech to-night, I took it for granted the Bill was going to be carried on the voices. Sir, it appears to me it is high time some steps were taken to re- strain to some extent the chartered libertinism of some of the newspapers of the colony. I be- lieve I am speaking the truth when I say that a  very considerable number of the newspapers of this colony have for years fought against the rights of the people - the rights of the de- mocracy-and in favour of the privileges, the unrighteous privileges, of the classes - I was going to say of the aristocracy ; but "aristocracy," after all, is a good term ; it is a term which ought to be applied to the best people, and per- haps in such a connection as this I ought not to use it -- but I should say, as I have said, on behalf of the classes, and particularly of the wealthy capitalists. Sir, I am not surprised at the honourable member for Waihemo speaking strongly against this Bill, for surely he is the one of all men in this House who can least complain of being ill-treated by the Press. He seems to be the special pet and favourite-" the curly headed boy " .- of some of the newspapers of the colony. And I can assure you that down our way the sayings and movements, however insignificant, of the honourable member for Waihemo are chronicled and blazoned forth in the columns of the newspapers with every sign and mark of approval. Does the honourable gentleman write a letter to a Minister : Forthwith there is a local in the news- paper to the effect that the honourable mem- ber for Waihemo-the indefatigable member -has written to the Minister so-and-so. and so-and-so, and a favourable answer may be expected shortly .. two or three inches of it. Does the honourable gentleman go to a cattle show, the report commences : "Amongst the distinguished guests was the honourable mem- ber for Waihemo." Does he send a telegram I audience, and they carried a vote of thanks to Mr. Collins railway journey for two or three miles : it is duly chronicled with a great flourish of trum- pets in the papers. Does he make a little speech at some function or another : it does not matter who or what goes short the honourable member gets a long report. So it is easy to understand the honourable gentleman's par- tiality for the newspapers. It is not difficult to understand how it is that I am not quite so partial. Sir, I think I may claim the distine- tion-I do not know whether it is a "proud distinction "-but for one who has been in politics for so short a time as I have I have had more abuse levelled at me, and more libel- lous, if I might so call them, paragraphs in news- papers about me than almost any other member in the House. I confess, at one time, this sort of thing gave me a considerable amount of an- novance. When I was younger I used to think they had a great deal of influence, and that I  would be regarded by people as if I was a black- sheep and a bad character generally, and that my friends would never look at me again. But as time went on I found that the people were not altered in the least, and that my constitu- ents always welcomed me and shook hands with me all the same, and it did not seem to make a bit of difference. One of the latest examples of newspaper criticism that I came across was in a paper that I confess I never saw before-a paper published in Napier, I think, called the Telegraph. It refers to me as the "canting. posing Barclay," and it also alludes to me as the "sea-green incorruptible," which, as every-  body knows, was Carlyle's synonym for the celebrated Robespierre. I ask you if it is fair criticism to refer to me-such an inoffensive, mild, harmless person as I am-as a modern Robespierre ? Sir, as far as the newspapers in my own district are concerned, I am bound to say that the Times is extremely well conducted, and although opposed to me in politics has always treated me very fairly in that respect. There is one column in that newspaper, however, which some nondescript and anonymous writers contribute to, headed " Passing Notes," and if it was not unparlia- mentary I would say it was a sort of sink for all the wretched worthless stuff that those un- fortunate writers could produce. It used at one time to be a brilliant and humorous column, but of late years it has sunk very very far below its old level. There is another paper with which I seem to live in a sort of chronic state of awe, called the Erening Stair, also published in Dunedin. This is the paper which shortly after my election published in its lead- ing columns in large capitals that, "morally, Mr. Barclay does not represent the people of Dunedin "- in large capitals, mind you. Well, it made me quite uncomfortable for a little while. However, in due course I met my con- stituents on the public platform. and I ex- pected to be greeted by a howling mob and to have it demonstrated to me that " morally I did not represent the people of Dunedin." but, to my astonishment, there was a large and orderly 
<page:195>
Well, Sir, I began then to appreciate at its proper value what was stated in the newspapers. Quite lately they have prophesied again-at least, they have made exactly similar statements lately and prophesied great disaster in the future. I can only say that any political can- didate can have the Press of the colony so long as I have the people ; and I think I may say that the majority of the newspapers do not represent the political views, at all events, of the mass of the people. I imagine that honourable mem bers are probably quite tired of hearing the personal experiences of various members with their newspapers ; and, seriously speaking, I think the best thing would be for the Govern- ment to take the whole question of libel into their consideration and formulate some legisla- tion on the matter. As it seems to have been lately decided that the law of criminal libel is not in force in this colony, it is necessary that the Government should do something in this matter. Probably the best thing would be to have a Bill on the subject of libel prepared, and deal with the whole question. I shall, however, vote for the second reading of the honourable gentleman's Bill, as being a Bill that is necessary, though no doubt incomplete. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City). - Sir, the honourable member for Waihemo is one of those driettante politicians who enjoy what is called a newspaper - made reputation. Once upon a time there was another politician in this House of the same type -Mr. Scobie Mac-  kenzie-who also enjoyed a newspaper - made reputation. Mr. Scobie Mackenzie was a singu- lar compound. He was always a "coming" Minister of the Crown, with a newspaper-made reputation. He was always "coming," and would have been "coming" still if he had been here to-day on the strength of his news- paper-made reputation ; but he never became a Minister of the Crown, to the great disappoint- ment of the newspaper gentlemen who assisted in the making of the newspaper-made reputa- tion. So he became soured with politics, and politics became soured with him. Now, why did Mr. Scobie Mackenzie not become a Minis ter of the Crown ? He deluged this House year after year with his flippant persiflage. He was the most pawky and painful wit that ever ad- dressed this House, skilful in the use of seur- rilous and abusive language, and the scurrilous language used by Mr. Scobie Mackenzie, strange to say, was always allowed to pass muster, whereas the same language used by any other person was invariably objected to as being un- parliamentary. I have frequently remarked upon this in this House. I have heard this gentleman with his newspaper-made reputation use language with regard to gentlemen sitting on the Government benches which would dis- grace any public assemblage in this or any other country. Next we had another curled darling of the Press in the person of the member for Waihemo. When the member for Waihemo arrived from London in one of those bran-new stylish London tailor-made suits, we were as- sured by the Press that it was necessary imme- to be placed on the electoral roll with a view to his election to the House, so that he might place before the people of this country a statement of the iniquities that were perpetrated in the Lon- don market in regard to the sale of New Zea- land produce. In fact, it was hinted in the most confident and confidential way that if Mr. Thomas Mackenzie did not get into Parliament the heavens would probably fall. New Zealand produce would come down with a run ; the whole business would tumble about our ears. Still, we did not pass that amendment of the Electoral Act, and still the country went pro- sperously on. The sun rose every morning as usual ; the stars shone at night ; the tides ebbed and flowed ; the rivers ran to the sea ; and the world revolved on its own axis. And so it was with Mr. Scobie Mackenzie - that eminent gentleman -- that great litterateur-who dabbled in the belles lettres. He wished to come back to this Parliament : and why is he not here now ? He once prophesied, at the end of the last Parliament, and before the last general election. He said to a friend of my own that he was going back to his electorate to seek re-election. He said his seat was a certainty ; but he said to my friend, " I am sorry for poor Fisher, his chance is gone, he has no hope, ho is politically dead." Then came the result of the election. Fisher, the hopeless, is elected, and Scobie, the confident, is rejected! The man of newspaper-made reputation is left out as a dreary " has been." He is , on est. And the newspapers weep. They deplore the fas- tidious taste of the electors in electing Fisher and rejecting Scobie. But then the honourable member for Waihemo and those who vote and think as he votes, and thinks -- Mr. LAWRY .- He does not think. Mr. FISHER .- He thinks and votes in sup- port of the newspapers, who, in turn, so much support him. In that respect he is not singular. One goed turn deserves another. His whole political career reminds me of a famous epitaph -- " He spent his life in going to the rescue of the strongest." And so it is with the news- papers. Certainly it is true of the two news- papers published in Wellington. They spend their lives "in going to the rescue of the strongest." They proceed upon the plan of a noted satirist who well understood the principle upon which a certain class of newspapers is conducted. Phil Fudge, in his celebrated letter to his brother, says :- ### God knows I love, to ev'n excess, The sacred freedom of the Press ; My only aim's-to crush the writers. What is the true art of journalism ?- to crush the writers. Write to order. That is the art. You will find that to be the case in the conduct of most of the newspapers of this country. Especially is it the case in regard to the two newspapers in this town. They are subject to monetary and social influence, and any person who has not wealth behind him, any person  who has not strong social relationships in this city, finds no space in the newspapers. I would 
<page:196>
like to ask where the two eminent gentlemen who edit the two newspapers in Wellington got their newspaper education ? I have the history of both, but I need not weary the House by a re- cital of that history. One to-day is a democrat -a Radical of Radicals -- but he is one of those democrats, singular to say, who once was in an adjoining colony a Conservative of Con- servatives ; but, having failed as a Queensland land-grabber, he is now a New Zealand demo- crat. Indeed, a strange conversion. In regard to the member for Christchurch City (Mr. Collins), I fear the honourable gentleman fel! into an error which is common in the case of many persons who discuss this question of the libel law. The honourable gentleman says, and truly says, that that man need not fear the criticism of any newspaper who can live with- out dread of the libel la v. But, then, he as- sumes that newspaper criticism applies only to public men. There is the error. It is not so much the public man who is injuriously affected by the newspaper criticism. A public man can defend himself on the public platform. He can defend himself in ordinary conversation with his constituents in the highways and by- ways-morning, noon, and night. It is the private person who is most injuriously affected by unjust newspaper criticism. It is the pri- vate person, who is given no opportunity to answer any slanderous misrepresentations which may appear in a newspaper, who suffers most. He is wholly at the mercy of the newspaper writer who guides the destinies of these penny rags. I have known great pain and misery inflicted through the insertion of anonymous and malignant statements. The person ma- ligned sends an explanatory letter to the newspaper, and he most probably gets an answer in the form of notice to correspondents in this form : "A. B., your letter is declined." What possible reparation is there for that person ? The editor is master of the situation ; and even if he deigns to publish your explana- tory letter he most likely appends to it some impertinent foot-note, as if he had the right to give you impertinence in addition to his slander. Sir, it is high time these gentlemen were put in their proper place. I wish the Legislature would relegate to me the duty of dealing with these gentlemen. The remedy, I assure the House, would be very effective. Then, the honourable member for Christ- church City refers to the amount of the penalty mentioned in the proviso to section 3, and says with a flourish, as if ridiculing the whole clause, " What is the use of it ? There is no means of enforcing the penalty prescribed in the clause." Does the honourable gentleman know so little of the law of the land in which he lives? Is there no such thing as a Justices of the Peace Act ? Of course there is, and there is means of enforcing the penalty. There is no diffi- culty in the matter whatever. I was a little astonished at the honourable gentleman, who is usually so accurate-and because he is so accurate and so studious -- I was rather sur- prised that he fell into that error. I now, Sir, leave the Bill in the hands of the House. I Mr. Fisher need not say I hope the House will carry the second reading. The proposals contained in the Bill are simple in the extreme. They do away, as I said in moving the second reading, with all possibility for the necessity for instituting a libel action. It would ease the minds of all persons who may otherwise be troubled with libel suits. They will have this simple 9.30. process of going to the Stipendiary Magistrate's Court and settling their difficulty in a summary way, instead of waiting, as they have to do under the existing law, for perhaps three months for the sitting of the Supreme Court, employing lawyers with large fees, calling hordes of witnesses and jurymen, all of which will be done away with if this Bill is passed.

THIRD READING. - Rhodes Trust Bill. NEW HEBRIDES ISLANDS. The Hon. Mr. W. C. SMITH asked the Minis- ter of Education, If the Government will sub- mit a resolution to Parliament urging the Imperial Government to take immediate steps to prevent further French aggressions in the New Hebrides, and also, if possible, to secure these islands for British possessions ? The reason he had put this question on the Order Paper was that he had friends in the New Hebrides who had been there for the last ton years, and they informed him that the French aggressions in these islands were getting very much worse than they had been in the past, when they had been bad enough. It seemed that what they did was this: Whenever they bought a small piece of land from the natives they then claimed nearly the whole island. The case then went before a French man-of- war captain, who maintained the claim. The result was that if something was not done he understood the islands were fast drifting into the hands of the French. He had this on the best authority from people who lived amongst the natives and understood them. He hoped the Government would see their way by reso- lution of Parliament, or in some other way, to give a strong expression of opinion in this colony that we did not wish these islands to go into the hands of the French. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER said this was an important question, and was getting more important every day. The Government did not want to give up any of the rights they already possessed in these seas, or to give any opportunity to foreign nations to strengthen the position they had unfortunately been allowed to occupy. As regarded the question put by the honourable gentleman, he wished to state that, along with the Premier of the Commonwealth, the Premier of New Zealand had made joint representations to the Imperial authorities to take steps to preserve British interests in the New Hebrides. Inquiries had been urged in regard to certain reported purchases of land from the natives by the French, and it had been further urged on a Commission which was there inquiring into the subject that some gentleman should be appointed who had had experience in New Zealand as to the methods of dealing with native lands, as had been the practice in the colony. He thought it would be admitted that the Government were quite alive to the ques- tion, and were doing their best to maintain the rights of Englishmen in these seas. HEALTH OFFICER, WELLINGTON. The Hon. Mr. JENKINSON said he would like to ask the Minister a question on a matter of urgency. He would like to ask the honour- able gentleman if his attention had been called to a complaint made in the public Press as to the manner in which the Health Officer at Wellington was carrying out his duties. As matters were at present the Health Ofheer was in the habit of greatly inconveniencing business people and the travelling public, and of practi- cally riding rough-shod over the community. He appeared to have a free hand. It was surely 
<page:198>
the officer's duty to treat the interests of the i ment have given notice of, or have actually travelling and business people with despatch, and, that being so, it was time that attention was drawn to the manner in which the officer carried out his duties. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER said he had noticed in the papers a complaint against the Health Officer, and he had a certain amount of fellow-feeling with the honourable gentleman who had put the question, as they both went through the same ordeal on one occasion. Fortunately, however, they were in a good state of health. The matter was one he would mention to his colleague the Minister of Public Health. Of course, if delays could be avoided, he hoped steps would be taken to see that that was done. At the same time it was no use talking about the inspection of vessels that came from foreign places if the inspection was to be a real inspection. If it was to be real, it was only fair the Health Officer should have a little discretion in carrying out his duties in the way he thought they should be carried out. He (Mr. Walker) had been repeatedly put under quarantine and subjected to inspection at many ports, and his regret had always been that the inspection was such a formal matter that it was of no value at all. Therefore he thought they should give some consideration to the Health Officer, who thought he had a responsible posi- tion to fill, and who, no doubt, thought it was his duty to be careful. However, he would consult with his colleague the Minister of Health, who, he had no doubt, would com- municate with his officer as to how the duties might be performed with the least amount of friction to the passengers and the general public. # REFERENDUM BILL. # ADJOURNED DEBATE. The Hon. Colonel PITT .- Sir, before this matter goes to the vote I wish tosay one or two words. I do not suppose I can add anything new to the debate that has already taken place, and I should not have spoken had it not been for some remarks that were made by the Hon. the Minister of Education in his speech vester- day, all of which, unfortunately, I did not hear : but in what I did hear I think he did not fully represent the true position in reference to the provisions of the Commonwealth Act as to dis- agreements between the two Houses. Before I come to that, however, I should like to say that, with the Hon. Mr. Arkwright, who has moved the amendment, I feel sorry indeed that I can- not support the leader of the Council upon this measure. I think that on all broad matters of policy of the Government for the last ten years the majority of this Council and I claim to be one with them are quite pre- pared to give a loyal support to that poliev. But, Sir, I do not regard this Bill as a policy Bill at all. This question of the referendum has been introduced from time to time by private members, and the position of the Government in reference to it has been various. At times the Government have very stoutly opposed it, and on other occasions, I believe, the Govern- Hon. Mr. Jenkinson i introduced, a Bill almost identical with the Bill at present before the Council, but it has not gone forward. Therefore, Sir, I can only re- gard it that the Government have, out of good nature or something of the kind, taken up a private member's Bill and have introduced it as their own. Well, I do not feel bound to sup- port a Bill introduced by the Government in that way, and I regret to say it is not the only Bill on our Order Paper which I think is in that position. At all events, I am prepared to speak on the Bill itself and on its merits : and I say that the Bill has no merits, and that we ought to reject it, as I have no doubt it will be rejected. The honourable gentleman said yes- terday that many of the members of the Coun- cil had addressed themselves to this question as if the existence of the Council itself was con- cerned in the matter. Sir, that cannot be so. This Bill cannot, nor can any Bill that can be created or referred to the people under it, in any way affect the existence of this Council. That is clearly defined by the Constitution Acts of 1852 and 1857, and no Bill could affect the existence of the Council unless it were an Act of the Imperial Parliament. So that so far as that is concerned this Bill can- not affect this Council one iota, for I say that no Bill which could be referred to the referendum under this Bill could affect our existence as a Conneil in any way whatever, although honour- able members possibly may be aware --- as I am aware - on looking into the past history of this referendum question, that when a similar Bil! was introduced by a private member, and a deputation waited upon the Premier in refer- ence to it, the member in charge of the Bill and the deputation accompanying him told the Premier that the principal object of the Bill was the abolition of the Legislative Council : but, of course, they were not aware - for the moment, at all events -- that the existence of the Legislative Council could not be affected by any such Bill. But the Bill itself is absolutely useless. There is no finality about it. As the Hon. Mr. Louisson and other honourable members have said. to pass such a Bill as this would be an attempt on the part of the Legislature to abrogate their own func- tions, and the result would be to refer to an uninformed or misinformed body of electors a question which the legislators themselves are fully informed upon and ought to deal with themselves. And, if there is to be any good in such a measure as this, there surely ought to be some finality in the matter ; but there will be no finality under this Bill. If a Bill is rejected by either House on two separate occasions, and is referred to the referendum attempted to be set up under this Bill, and the voters agreed that the Bill ought to become law, and it did become law, what is to prevent Parliament passing a Bill the next session to repeal that law ? Nothing whatever. Parlia- ment cannot divest itself of its legislative func. tions : it must exercise them ; and therefore such a Bill as this is purely waste paper. And. if the thing is to be pushed to its logical con- 
<page:199>
clusion, I would like to ask what would be the | position of the Government under such a refer- endum as this : Supposing one of their policy measures -- one which they regarded as of very great importance-supposing that was intro- duced by them, say, in the House of Represen- tatives and passed by that House, and then rejected twice by the Legislative Council, and was referred to the electors under this Bill, and the electors rejected it. What is to be the position of the Government then ? Are they going to accept it as a vote of want of confidence and resign ? Because it appears to me that is what ought to be done ; and that is the position the Government would possibly land themselves in by appealing from a well- informed tribunal on a matter to a misinformed or uninformed tribunal such as the electors might be. The only other matter I wish to refer to is this : The Minister of Education yesterday spoke of a similar provision to this existing under the Commonwealth Act. I think the honourable gentleman overlooked clause 57 of the Commonwealth Act. That is the clause which refers to disagreements between the Houses, in precisely a similar way in which dis- agreements are referred to under this Bill ; but the course provided for there is this : that the Governor-General under that section dissolves both Houses, and then, after a general election, if the deadlock continues, the matter is dis- posed of by both Houses sitting together, and a majority of both then rules. Of course, there  is not a strict analogy between the two cases, because under the Commonwealth Act both Houses are elected. The referendum in that Act, to which the honourable gentleman referred, has reference only to amendments of the Constitution, and in order to secure that there must be a majority of the electors in a majority of the States, and those majorities must constitute a majority of the whole of the electors voting; therefore the analogy would not be complete until those con ditions were fulfilled under this Bill, by provid- ing that there should be upon a referendum a majority of electors in a majority of the con- stituencies in this colony, and that such majorities should be a majority of all the electors voting. I have not the slightest doubt as to what the fate of this Bill will be, and I am sure it must be unpleasant to many of those gentlemen who usually support the Government to have to vote against the Minister upon this occasion as we shall have to do. The Hon. Mr. Twomey, in addressing the Council, built up a very in- genious argument as to the result of the referendum in Switzerland. He contended that the result there showed it to be a Conservative measure. It remains to be seen whether there is any special reason why those who are not always in accord with the policy of the Govern- ment should not have spoken on this Bill - whether they regard it as a Conservative mea- sure, or whether they regard it as an injurious piece of legislation. However, I myself feel compelled to vote for the amendment. The Hon. Mr. SCOTLAND. - When the motion for the adjournment of the debate on this Bill was carried the other afternoon I almost felt regret that the discussion had not come to an end then and there, but, after listening to the words which have fallen from the Hon. Colonel Pitt, I congratulate myself and I congratulate the Council on the Bill not having been disposed of yesterday. Colonel Pitt has put in a very neat and concise form the whole question of the referendum. I think the Minister of Education was hardly justified yesterday in calling upon us to bow to the opinion of the Commonwealth of Australia. It does not necessarily follow that there must be more wisdom in the Commonwealth of Aus- tralia than in the Parliament of New Zealand. I believe that in proportion to size and popula- tion there are just as many educated men and sound thinkers in New Zealand as there are in Australia. Why, then, should we bow down and worship the Commonwealth of Australia because it has been just set up with a great flourish of trumpets? I do not see any reason for that at all. We are perfectly competent, I believe, to manage our own affairs, and to decide, after deliberation, whether the re- ferendum should be introduced here or not. There is one provision in the Constitution of the Commonwealth which I approve of, and which was mentioned by the Hon. Colonel Pitt just now. It is that, in the case of a difference of opinion between the two Houses the matter can be referred to the collective wisdom of Par- liament. I also say, let the two Houses sit together, let them compare opinions, let them listen to each other patiently and with all de- ference, and then let the vote of the majority de- cide whether the Bill in dispute shall be passed or not. This idea was broached years ago, and, in my opinion, it would be the wisest solution of the difficulty. Why it has not already been adopted in New Zealand is to me incompre- hensible, and, old man as I am, I hope I shall not cease to be a member of this House before such a thing comes to pass.

WALKER .- This Bill has been before the Council before, and the shape in which it has come down this year is virtually the shape in which it emerged last vear from the Statutes Revision Committee. I therefore trust that the Council will pass the second reading, and that it will not think it necessary to send it back to the Statutes Re- vision Committee. It has been before that Com- mittee two sessions, and last year it was thoroughly discussed, and put into the shape in which we see it now. It is a very simple measure. Whether it will be fruitful of good or not is a matter I am not able to say, because we cannot by statute or other arrangement prevent a lawyer coming into business in some form. I admit that the wise man employs a lawyer in most business transactions. How- ever, we have already in the matter of land transfer provided a simpler form of dealing with land. This Bill provides little else except a simple method of mortgaging land, having on the document indorsed the covenants which the mortgage contains within it, the applica- tion of insurance money in case of fire, and for the protection of the mortgagee as regards de- fault or otherwise. Clause 4 provides, - "(1.) Every such mortgage, if relating to land under 'The Land Transfer Act, 1885,' shall for all purposes be deemed to be a memo- randum of mortgage within the meaning of that Act. "(2.) Every such mortgage, if relating to land under ' The Deeds Registration Act, 1868,' shall for all purposes be deemed to be a deed or instrument within the meaning of that Act, and a deed of conveyance of land by way of mortgage within the meaning of 'The Property Law Con- solidation Act, 1883,' and may be registered under the former Act accordingly." renewed in the prescribed form simply by in- dorsement, and the mortgagee can transfer his interest. All this is provided for by this Bill. If it will reduce the interest charges on bor- rowed money, especially in the case of small men, it will be a matter for congratulation. The Bill was so carefully gone through last year that I believe it is now in a workable shape. I beg to move the second reading of the Bill. The Hon. Mr. STEVENS .- It is perfectly correct, as my honourable friend has said, that the provisions of this Bill have been under the review of the Statutes Revision Committee on a former occasion ; but it must not be under- stood because that has taken place that the principle of the Bill has been approved or ac-  cepted by that Committee. I trust my honour- able friend will agree to refer the Bill to the Sta- tutes Revision Committee, and that the Regis- trar-General of Lands shall be invited to attend that Committee and give his opinion as to what the effect will be, departmentally and other- wise, of the adoption of this measure ; because I am perfectly satisfied in my own mind that it will probably be attended with very serious and very evil consequences. The argument that my honourable friend has used, that the Land Transfer Act has provided a simple means of mortgaging, is one of the principal objections to this Bill. Any one can now procure land-transfer forms and prepare a mortgage from any person to himself, and can proceed to register in the ordinary way. But the whole thing is that the act of registration can only be performed at the centre where a registration office exists, and in the general manner now adopted. Therefore the argument of my honour- able friend as to the simple manner of making mortgages is not really an argument in favour of this Bill. For the registration of the mort- gage some one or other must be employed, or the holder must visit the registry. As regards what we call mortgages under the old Act, which are contemplated under this Bill, there the same difficulty will arise: a person might prepare a mortgage himself, and all these covenants in the schedule would be supposed to be implied ; but I am very doubtful whether that would be the effect of it, and whether they would be so implied. I am not speaking for one instant in the interests of the lawyers, but I am speaking in the interests of in- dividuals not engaged in this class of business, who, I am perfectly convinced, will very fre- quently neglect to register their mortgages, and then two or three years afterwards, when it occurs to them to register, they find that some one else has stepped in before them and registered a lien. That will be the effect, I am sure, of people tinkering with matters with which they are not familiar. I trust the Council will not take my word for this, nor that of my honourable friend as to the expedieney of the Bill, but that they will send it to the Statutes Revision Committee, with the view of having it properly considered. There is one point that renders this especially desirable : Land Transfer mortgages are included in the Bill, and the whole system provided by 
<page:201>
tures of the contracting parties is completely altered by the Bill. I say, therefore, that it is necessary to get the opinion of a departmental officer upon it. The Hon. Mr. T. KELLY .- The object of this Bill is, I presume, to enable persons who are small borrowers to get legal transactions com- pleted without excessive payment. That is the main object of the Bill. Of course, persons with means. when the transaction is large, can em- ploy a lawyer to do the work for them at a reasonable cost. Now, with regard to the lending departments of the Government-the Advances to Settlers, the Public Trust Office, and the lending department of the Post Office- the mortgages there are chiefly conducted by the departments-especially the Public Trust Office -and with safety to the department, and at a reasonable charge. But when lawyers are engaged in small mortgages the charges are excessive and recurring, because the money is lent for short periods. Why could not some means be devised, under this Bill or otherwise, by which the lender could be secured and the borrower get his money cheaply ? I think it could be done, and I think this Bill does not go far enough, and will not carry out the object in view. A great majority of the titles to land in New Zealand are good, and are easily traceable in the Survey Department and in the Registry Office; and if a duly qualified official to deal with these things were appointed to fill up the forms, having in-  vestigated the title to secure the safety of the lender, and charged a reasonable fee, the whole difficulty would be got over. Perhaps the mort- gage has to be renewed every two or three years, and, to my mind, it is simply monstrous the amount that small borrowers have to pay. It is certainly in the interests of both parties that the thing should be done cheaply and well, and the only way out of the difficulty that I can see is for the Government to set aside an officer of the Land Transfer Department to do the work, provided the lender and borrower agree to that course being taken. The Hon. Colonel PITT .- What the honour- able gentleman in charge of the Bill has said is quite true-that it was before the Statutes Revision Committee last year ; but he did not tell the Council that when it came before the Statutes Revision Committee it was far different from what it is now. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- I said it was formerly here. The Hon. Colonel PITT. . But you did not say it is now a different document from what went to the Committee. As a matter of fact, this is a Bill that a private member has had before Parliament for many years, and now through . the good offices of the Government it has reached this stage; and it was through the lawyer, on the Statutes Revision Committee that it has been made presentable, and it is not now perfect. The objection to the Bill is that it is absolutely unnecessary. It will complicate and increase the different forms of mortgage. The result must be confusion. There is at present I mortgage. Then, there is the mortgage under the present Land Transfer Act, and likewise under the Advances to Settlers Act; and an endeavour has been made to get a compound of : all three in this Bill. The Hon. the Minister says that the object of this form of mortgage is to enable any one to fill it up, so that it may be done cheaply ; but what is wanted is that per- sons who lend money should have security. Section 4 says that every such mortgage, if relating to land under "The Land Transfer Act, 1845," shall be deemed to be a mortgage under that Act, and, if relating to land under "The Deeds Registration Act, 1868," shall be deemed to be a mortgage under that Act. Well, Sir, under the Land Transfer Act the matter may be simple. There is the certificate of title showing the encumbrances, if any, upon the land ; but if the land be not under the Land Transfer Act who is to say whether the title is correct ? Before advancing his money the man in the street cannot say if the proposed mortgage would be safe. My objection to this Bill is that it is altogether unnecessary, and that it is an interference by a layman-not by the Hon. the Minister, but by the real author of the Bill -- with a subject that, with all due respect to him, I venture to say he does not understand, and if this Bill passes at all it will tend to the confusion of the law. What is required, and what would best serve the people of this colony, is that the Govern- ment should take some steps to bring all the land of the colony under the Land Transfer Act, and if that were done I think the mode of dealing with land would be sufficiently simple. There should then be no difficulty whatever. If this Bill be passed as it is, 1 venture the opinion that there will be extreme confusion in the administration of the Land Transfer Act as far as affected by transactions under this Bill. The suggestion made by the Hon. Mr. Stevens that the opinion of the Registrar-General of Land should be obtained is a good one. I cannot see my way to vote for the Bill. The Hon. Mr. TWOMEY .- Sir, two objec- tions have been raised against this measure. The first was raised by the Hon. Mr. Stevens, and the second by the Hon. Colonel Pitt. The Hon. Mr. Stevens said it was all a matter of registration ; and the Hon. Colonel Pitt said the measure was unnecessary, because anything that could be done under it could be done under the present law. As regards the question of re- gistration, the Hon. Mr. Stevens said that some persons would neglect to register, with the re- sult that some one else would do so. I cannot see how this could be. The man could be in no worse position than persons holding an un- registered mortgage, and we know very well that there are many such documents in the country. When a man lends money on mortgage he gets two documents namdy, the deeds of the land-that is, the certi- ficate of title-and also the mortgage deed, and he retains both during the currency of the Now, how can any one register mortgage. 
<page:202>
another mortgage while he holds the certificate of title. The Hon. Colonel PITT .- Previous registra- tion. The Hon. Mr. TWOMEY. - Then, that would be a swindle. However, there may be something in the point raised by the Hon. Mr Stevens, and perhaps it would be as well to adopt the course suggested by him. All I wish to say is that borrowers of money will welcome anything that will cheapen law for them; they have been looking for this for a long time, and will be glad if it passes. The effect of it, in my opinion, will be that lenders of money will still insist on employing lawyers, but that the fees of the lawyers will be much less if they prepare deeds under this Bill.

Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) moved, That the amendments made by the Legislative Council in this Bill be agreed to. He said there was only one small amendment made, and, as would be seen, it was really an improvement to the Bill. The amendment consisted in the addition of a new clause, which provided that Road Boards might be appointed trustees, not- withstanding the Cemeteries Act of 1892. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) said he thought the Hon. the Minister was mistaken, and that this clause applied to where the Counties Act was in force. He did not object to the clause, but he did not think it was necessary, as it seemed to him to mean exactly the same thing as clause 2 of the Bill. Motion agreed to. # COUNTIES BILL. Mr. SEDDON (Premier). - I propose to take the second reading of this Bill, simply affirm- ing the necessity there is for amending the legislation dealing with the local government of the country. To have a protracted debate upon a subject we al! admit is a necessity would Hon. M .. Twomey be, to a great extent, a waste of time. It would be better to read the Bill a second time. An Hon. MEMBER. -- Pro forma ? Mr. SEDDON .- No, not pro forma ; send it to the Select Committee, and the real work in respect to amendments and suggestions will be all done in Committee. The second reading of the Bill is affirming the necessity for amended legislation as applied to local government. Certainly we admit that there is too much local government, far too many local bodies, at all events. An Hon. MEMBER .- They do not want any of the existing ones abolished. Mr. SEDDON .- Well, in that respect, much as I differ from the honourable member in the go-as-you-please policy, the measure as it now stands before us is full and complete, and a great improvement on existing legislation. My long experience proves to me that if you want pro- gress and reform it must first of all be optional, and then later on, when it is understood and is working satisfactorily, you may ask that it be made mandatory and compulsory. That has been my experience, and I have followed it in respect to this Bill. In agreeing to the second reading members may reserve to themselves the right when the Bill is in Committee to deal with the questions of representation and franchise. That is a point on which members will differ, and rightly so. Some will say, in respect to the franchise in the Bill, that we have not gone far enough, and others again will say we have gone too far. Well, I would say, agree to the second reading of the Bill with the reservation I have made in respect to this. It is not sufli- cient to warrant the members of the House refusing the Bill its second reading, or proceed- ing with the Bill in Committee. A difference of opinion on the franchise is, as I say, a legiti- mate one ; but the course I ask you to take is that we get this Bill read a second time, and then refer it to the Committee. The question will be threshed out there, and when it emerges from the Select Committee and goes into the Committee of the House we will be able to give effect to the wishes of the majority of the mem- bers of the House. An Hon. MEMBER. - Why not take it pro forma ? Mr. SEDDON .- It will not help at all to take the second reading of the Bill pro forma. Get the Bill along to the Committee, and then, when you have it in Committee, you will have the position better defined. I have had several Bills dealt with in the same 1 way, and the best course to adopt, where the difference was confined principally to a question of policy in respect to the franchise, is to pass the second reading. Let it go to the Committee, and, in Committee, the whole matter can be thoroughly settled, and it will be pretty well understood on the Select Committee where the majority of the members are and what their opinions are. I may say, in respect to counties, they are retained under the Bill. I notice also that some new counties are to be formed, and the proposals are before Parliament. The rea- son for this splitting-up and increasing the  
<page:203>
counties arises from the fact that they are so | districts of the colony. This brings me to far distant from any centre, and the territory is so great, and the circumstances and conditions differ so widely, that it is necessary to sweep away the Road Boards of the locality and make a small county. That is what was done in one Bill passed here the other day, and that has been done with the unanimous consent of the Road Boards and local bodies. That showed that the original boundaries were too large and the county unwieldy. This is a matter upon which there can be little or no difference of opinion, and I do want to have an Act passed, and not have applications con- tinually coming before the House for changing boundaries and creating new local bodies. Then, this brings up the question of Road Boards. Now, in one of the Bills originally adopted the passing of the Bill meant prac- tically the extinction of Road Boards; but I found in some parts of the colony that the con- ditions were such that the Road Boards, if there was to be any local government at all, were an absolute necessity. This was the case in some parts of Canterbury. Take the East Coast up towards the Kaikouras- An Hon. MEMBER .-- There are no Road Boards there. Mr. SEDDON .-- The latest information I have upon the subject is from Sir George Clifford. I thought his estate was up in that direction. Mr. MEREDITH. It is on the Waipara Road, in the Ashley County. Mr. SEDDON. - Well, at all events, I think the distance from the nearest centre is about one hundred miles, and the control and management of the roads the County Coun- cil itself admitted could not be done by them, and that they ought to be controlled, and were controlled and maintained, by the Road Board. This was given as a case in point, but it is not the only one. I know there are many parts of the colony where the Road Board is de facto the local body. The extent of the county may be very great, and members may have to travel a long distance to the meetings of the Council, and in cases of that kind I think there cannot be the local supervision or the local knowledge that is ne- cessary for the carrying-on the work properly, and in instances of that nature a good argument is, no doubt, made out in favour of Road Boards. I am still of opinion, how- ever, that under such circumstances, it would be better to have more counties, and do away with all the local bodies except the ones that are given boundaries. Extended powers should also be given, and in addition an increased and assured finance. As to the question of finance, I think before dealing with it we should get this measure passed. The finance is provided for under another measure entirely, so that that aspect of the matter need not be dealt with in this Bill. If you provide the neces- sary machinery as contained in this Bill, you may then take up the finance ; but unless we have the necessary machinery we cannot divest ourselves of the responsibility of deal- ing with minor works affecting the country the question of subsidy. I am not at all in love with the existing system of subsidising, because wealthy communities draw the larger share of the money, while their requirements are really not so great as those of districts where there is development work to do. I would prefer to have subsidies given to local bodies on the amount expended on new works -- on roads and bridges. That, I think, would be a fair way to subsidise. Under the existing system of subsidising on the general rate you relieve other bodies and settlers of charges, and you are not advancing the development of the country at all. As far as the subsidies are concerned that are mentioned in the Bill, I may say I am going on the old Act. I am not making any change. As I have already said, let us have the powers granted that are provided in the Bill, and the matter of finance may then be dealt with under separate legislation, as it is at the present time. There will probably be a fight made in respect to the town districts, but I con- sider that the objection taken so far is purely a Committee objection. So long as they have the power of the dominant body maintained, I do not think it is wise to allow a settled population, as soon as it finds itself able to more than supply its own requirements, or when it is just able to supply its own re- quirements, to secede from the parent body, and, wrapping itself up, take the whole of its revenue to itself, while the burden of main- taining roads and keeping open means of communication is thrown on the ratepayers in the other district that is being excluded. It is a question whether we should go on existing lines, and allow these considerations ; whether it is not better for the district as a whole and for the people in that district where there are these revenue-producing centres, and those centres are supported and maintained by the outsiders - whether they should have the power they have at the present time of forming themselves into a local body and depriving the other districts of the large re- venue which they produce within this circle. I myself have long been of opinion that there has been too much of that. I have known dis- tricts where the ratepayers' money has gone to develop other bodies because of an aggregation of population, and the moment they have sur- plus revenue part of the district forms into a borough, and the rest of the county is im- poverished by that action. I think that in country districts the small boroughs are much more interested in the development and in the increase of population, and in the iu- crease of settlement - that without it the borough suffers ; and that being the case it would be much better if there was only the one governing body, the one common purse, and the one common control. Those are the views I hold upon that point, and, as far as I have been able, I have put them into this Bill. Another material alteration is that the whole of the County Councillors go out of office every two years, and the date of elections is altered from November to May.

Counties Bill, quite unprepared to discuss its new and varied provisions. I, at any rate, knowing I was to be a member of that Com- mittee, believed that the Bill would be referred to that Committee, and that there would merely be a motion to read the Bill a second time pro fo ma, so that the debate would take place after the Bill had been revised by the members of that Committee. I maintain, therefore, that honourable members are not now in a position to properly debate the subject. It is all very well to say it is only an amending Bill ; but, as a matter of fact, it is a Bill traversing the whole question of county government as it is at the present time. And then on account of one of the questions to which the Premier alluded, that of the alteration in the franchise, which is a matter of such vital importance to all local governments, the whole Bill ought to be discussed first in Select Committee as it only can be there, and the second - reading debate should take place when the recommendation is brought down to the House. Have honourable members realised this important fact, that under an alteration in the representation it will be quite possible for a County Council to consist simply of persons who do not own one penny- worth of property in the whole county ? In the 4Sth clause of the Bill it will be found that every person whose name appears on any county electors' roll for the time being in force for any riding shall be qualified to be elected as a member of the Council, and the persons whose names appear on the electoral roll may be persons who have a quarterly tenancy of the value of 50s. only, and no permanent holding, so it would be possible for the whole government of a particular county to consist of persons who did not own one pennyworth of property in the county. ] am now drawing attention to the fact because there are not half a dozen members in the Chamber who realise that there is such a drastic alteration in the system possible. So it is throughout, in the alteration of the Road Boards, or rather their destruction, in the i derstand it was nothing but an amending Bill ; creation of River Boards, having jurisdiction right from the source to the mouth of the river. All these matters are of such vital im- portance that if we now go through the form, before we have studied the Bill, of agreeing to its second reading, it will be held that the principle is one that is approved by the House. It is all very well to say that we can alter the Bill as we choose in Committee; but if We have affirmed the principle contained in the ! Bill we go a long way to passing a Bill, of which on reflection, on reading the Bill, we may not approve. I do not exaggerate the position when I say there are not half a dozen members of the House who have thoroughly read the Bill from beginning to end ; and yet we are asked to agree to it. But I say that the object which I have in view is to allow the local-go- vernment question to be considered thoroughly, not superficially, but after examination by honourable members who have taken part in local government, and are therefore best quali- fied to express an opinion on the subject. If we are to advance the passage of the Bill it should be first referred to a Select Committee, and then brought down for its second-reading debate. At some period or another of the pas- sage of the Bill it will have to be debated-the whole principle will have to be reviewed, and why not let us have an intelligent and fair discussion ? I would ask the Right Hon. the Premier to agree to adjourn the second reading for a week, and in the meantime the Committee which has been set up-though the Bill has not been referred to it-can meet, and let us ask the Committee to devote, say, Saturday and Monday to its consideration. Or, at any rate, all I ask is that the House shall not be in- vited to pass a Bill which I venture to say not half a dozen members have studied thoroughly. I presume, like myself, they have all been sufti- ciently curious to open up and read passages here and there, but have not devoted care and attention to its various clauses nor compared it with the existing statutes on local government. nor the bearing and relation between the powers to be given and to be taken away from local bodies- River Boards, Road Boards, et cetera. The general alteration in the system of local government, I say. is one of such vast concern that it should not be dealt with in a perfunctory manner. To postpone the consideration of this Bill for a week or a fortnight-I say a fortnight would be best -- to allow members to have a fair chance of studying it would not be to jeopardize the Bill at all. It would tend to reduce dis- cussion and to secure intelligent consideration, rather than having what may possibly be- come an unintelligible debate, because mem- bers have not been able to study the subject they are called upon to vote on. I move the adjournment of the debate. Mr. SPEAKER .- The honourable gentleman cannot move the adjournment of the debate after discussing the principles of the Bill. Captain RUSSELL .- I did not intend to dis- cuss the Bill, but to point out the reasons for adjournment, because the Premier led us to un- whereas in reality it involves complete change of the principles of local government. Mr. ATKINSON (Wellington City) .- I move the adjournment of the debate. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .-- I do not think what has been said would apply to this Bill, or that honourable members are in the position that has been alleged. The Bill was introduced at the commencement of the session. We have now been sitting five weeks. I purposely bad the Bill introduced within the first few days of the session ; it has been before a Conference, and if members have not read the Bill itself they have been, I presume, doing their duty by reading what took place at the Conference. An Hon. MEMBER .- We have not had the report of the Conference yet. Mr. SEDDON .- If honourable members tell me they have not read what has taken place at the Conference-I have been able to swallow a great deal in my life - but if they tell me they have not read the proceedings of the Conference -more especially members representing coun- try districts-I can only say they have been 
<page:206>
master the Bill before us. An Hon. MEMBER. - It has not been printed. An Hon. MEMBER. - Do you mean what is recorded in the Press ? Mr. SEDDON .- I mean what has appeared in the Press. There is no necessity to adjourn the debate, because members are fully conver- sant with the Bill itself as it stands. It is not the first time it has been before a Committee or the House, and an adjournment would not facilitate matters. We are bound to have the whole thing in review in Committee of the House ; and if any member says there is an attempt to force the Bill through without due consideration after the Bill has been five weeks before the House he is asking me to really doubt members' sincerity. An Hon. MEMBER .- Why not read it pro forma ? Mr. SEDDON .- Reading the Bill pro forma would not help very much its progress. If members do not want the Bill let them say so, and I will take it that this motion for the second reading is not wanted. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston) .- I cannot under- stand the new method of procedure that the Premier proposes to set up under our Standing Orders; for the proper thing to do when a Bill is to be referred to a Select Committee is to move that Bill pro forma, so that there shall be an opportunity when the Committee have licked the Bill into shape to consider its principles. The Premier said just now that we have all read the proceedings of the Counties  Conference. Well, I have read the proceed- ings as published in the papers, and that is one of the very reasons why I think we ought to have the debate on this Bill when it comes #cc-zero from the Select Committee ; because, if the re- solutions of the Counties Conference are to be adopted by the Select Committee, then the Bill will be in a different shape from what it is now. At the same time, the Premier is seek- ing to take an undue advantage of the House in asking it to debate this Bill, or to pass it without debate, before it has been before that Select Committee, and I would refer the Premier to last session when the procedure of reading the Municipal Corporations Bill pro forma was carried out, and when it came to a second reading before this House the whole de- bate did not last more than three-quarters of an hour, because the members who were concerned were so satisfied with the Committee's work that they did not want to waste the time of the House in discussing the second reading. There- fore, if the same procedure is followed with this Bill there cannot possibly be delay in passing the legislation ; but if the amendments of the Committee are against the interests of the coun- try then it is quite right that we should have an opportunity on the report of the Committee of discussing the Bill on practically its second reading. But I would like to point out to the Premier that, even if his motion is now carried, the second reading would not carry with it the possibility of doing without a debate when the Bill comes from the Committee ; because, on the Mr. Seddon reading debate can be taken by the members of the House. Mr. SEDDON. -- I want to save two debates. Mr. PIRANI. - The Premier never thought of that at all, and it is as plain as daylight that the Premier wants to waste a day. He wants the discussion on this Bill, in its present form, to last the whole day, but he does not want to say so, and if he had moved the Bill pro forma it could not take the day. If the Premier is allowed to move it as he wishes now, he knows it forces the House into a debate on the merits of the Bill, and the whole day will be wasted. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) .-- It is all very well for the Premier to talk about this Bill having been circulated for five weeks, and of members having had ample time to consider it, but the Premier knows that the House has not been sitting for five weeks, and that the Bill was not circulated for at least one week after the House met. When the Bill was circulated a Com- mittee of experts was set up to consider it-a Committee consisting of over thirty members - and we were given to understand that after the setting up of that Committee the usual course would be followed : that the Bill would be read pro forma and referred to the Committee, and that the debate would be taken on the Bill coming back to the House, and on that under- standing I venture to say very few members have studied the Bill in the way they would otherwise have done. In this Bill there are 115 pages, 361 clauses and 10 schedules; but the Premier in introducing it -a Bill of this size -did so in a speech lasting only a quarter of an hour, and I venture to say that the honourable gentleman would have taken his full hour had he himself thoroughly understood the measure he was attempting to explain. Then the Premier talks about the report of the Conference which was published in the papers. Well, I put in an appearance at that Conference in a representative capacity, and I thought the Conference was doing good work and were dis- cussing the Bill in an intelligent manner ; but from what I saw in the papers I venture to say that not one-hundredth part of the proceedings of that Conference was reported, and it was impossible that it could be otherwise. I hope, consequently, the Premier will accept the motion to adjourn the debate and let it come on, say, on Tuesday, by which time members will have had an opportunity of making themselves acquainted with the provisions of the measure. Mr. MEREDITH (Ashley) .-- Sir, I think it is unfair for the Premier, who is in charge of this Bill, to expect members of the House representing country constituencies to swallow the Bill in globo. It is quite true that the Bill has now been in circulation for about a fortnight or so, but the honourable member must bear in mind that honourable members have a great deal to do on Committees, attend- ing to their correspondence, considering the various measures that come before this House, and, in many instances, the Order Paper only gives a very few hours' notice when they are to be brought on for discussion. We have to rush 
<page:207>
look up our correspondence with the view of obtaining information so as to be able intelli- gently to deal with these questions. Then, again, although the honourable gentleman gave notice for the setting - up of a Committee for the purpose of considering the Bill on the 16th July, the Committee was not set up until just re- cently, and the Committee, so far, has done nothing whatever except appoint a Chairman. I have followed, so far as I was able, the de- liberations of the Conference representing the country interests recently held in this city, but the information contained in the columns of the two newspapers published in Wellington is only fragmentary. How, then, is it possible to gousp the views of the country delegates from the information given in the columns of the local newspapers? The suggestions from the Conference have not yet been printed, and therefore are not available for members. The question under our consideration is a very im- portant one. I am in favour of the Bill, but not in favour of the whole of the provisions of the Bill, because I consider that many of them are inimical to the interests of the people whom I have the honour to represent in this House. I may point out to the honourable gentleman that in speaking on the second reading of the Bill the honourable gentleman showed that he him- self does not really understand the provisions of the Bill that he wants the House now to read a second time. When speaking of Road Boards he referred to the Amuri County as containing  Road Boards. Now, neither the Cheviot County nor the Kaikoura County nor the Amuri County have any Road Boards within them ; only the Ashley County contains Road Boards. That county contains eight Road Boards. I have the honour to represent these four counties. Putting that aside, however, I think it is very unfair of the Premier to expect this House to commit itself to the provisions of the Bill without having the opportunity of going carefully through it clause by clause, and seeing its effect on the country. I want to help the Premier. I am not here opposing the Bill or its second reading, but I say " Give us time," and we are entitled to that. Wait until the Committee sits and deliberates. I am prepared if necessary to forego to-morrow or Monday, or even to meet on both these two days and to sit for ten hours each day and go through the Bill, sooner than swallow it now in globo, as the Premier asks us to do. Mr. W. FRASER (Wakatipu) .-. Some honour- able members have attempted to explain the reasons of the Premier for taking the course he has to-day. I shall not attempt to explain the extraordinary attitude he has taken up. Imme diately before making the motion for the second reading of this Bill the right honourable gentle- man took up the Factories Bill, and proposed that we should take the second reading of that pro forma. He moves pro forma the second reading of that Bill, and has it referred to the Labour Bills Committee; but when he comes to the Counties Bill, which, so far as the whole of the country settlers of New Zealand are than the Factories Bill, he will not refer it first to a Committee, but asks us to proceed at once to discuss the principles of that Bill. I can assure the right honourable gentleman there is no desire on our part to interfere with his mode of conducting the business of the House; none of us wish to do that. I would point out to him where the inconveni- ence will arise in our discussing the second reading just now : there will be no fair oppor- tunity of discussing the principle of the Bill when it is reported from Committee. The House will not have the Bill reproduced with all the amendments of the Committee until a later stage, and it will be only the members of the Committee who will know what has transpired. The other members of the House will simply have the bald report read out to them, and the debate will have to proceed upon that basis. Now, conceive that position as against the one if the Bill were read pro forma just now and remitted to the Com -. mittee. Then we should have the Bill with all the corrections of the Committee in print before us, and should have the necessary data on which to discuss it, both as to details and principles. That is one reason why the discussion of the second reading of the Bill should not be gone on with at present. Can it be possible that the Premier is anxious, by forcing on the second reading before sending the Bill to a Committee, to commit the House to affirming the principle of the Bill, so that he may say afterwards, " You were parties to the second reading of the Bill, and therefore you must abide by it ?" Surely that is not a fair position to put the House in. I ask the Premier whether he thinks that is a fair way of dealing with the House? As far as I am personally concerned, I am prepared to go on with the second reading of the Bill, because I have had the opportunity of going through it very carefully. I happened to be a member of the Conference that has had the Bill before it, and that went through the Bill clause by clause. But let me point out to members of the House another reason why I think the debate should be adjourned. Mem- bers should have before them the printed re- port of the amendments and suggestions of that Conference, and they have not got that. How many members know what the Conference has recommended? It is only a few days since the proof copy was submitted to me for correction, and I thought it would have been circulated amongst members before now. I will see that it is circulated amongst members in a day or so. I say members, when discussing this Bill, should have before them that report of the Conference, and then they will be pre- pared to speak in an intelligent way upon the second reading. I do not think it is fair to force the House to discuss this question until that can be done. I think the Premier ought, at any rate, to agree to postpone the discussion, if he is determined to force the second reading of the Bill. I appeal to him to reconsider even that aspect of the question, and to allow the Bill to be read pro forma, and to go before the 
<page:208>
Committee. I feel certain if he does that he will save a great deal of the time of the House, because after the report of the Conference has been circulated, and the Bill is printed with the corrections made in Committee, I do not think there will be one-tenth of the discussion in this House that would ensue at present. Mr. GUINNESS (Grey) .- I was very much astonished to hear the honourable member for Ashley say that he did not consider the Premier understood the provisions of the Bill. He must have known that he was not speaking according to the book, when we remember that the Pre- mier has brought this Bill down for three vears now. There is not a great deal of dif- ference between this Bill and those brought down in former sessions, and I cannot for the life of me see why objection should be made to discussing this Bill now. Members have had it in their possession for the last four weeks. It has been discussed by the Counties Confer- ence, and members, I am sure, have paid atten- tion to the reports of what has gone on at that Conference. It was not a verbatim report cer- tainly, but everything that was important was reported. No great principle is involved, and the Bill is more of a consolidating measure than anything else. As for the remarks of the honourable member for Wakatipu, that when the report of the Committee comes down members will not have the amendments made by that Committee before them so that they can dis- cuss the report, members know very well that,  if they desire to have the Bill with the amend- ments before them, nothing is simpler than to move the adjournment of the debate for a day or two; and if there is a desire to have those amendments before them the adjournment of the debate will be agreed to by the Premier, and we shall have the Bill with the amend- ments before us for discussion. There was another objection that the honourable member for Wakatipu urged which I cannot see any weight in. He says that if we affirm the principle in the Bill, as the Premier wants us to do, the Premier will say that we are bound by it and cannot make any alterations. An Hon. MEMBER. -- We have heard that be- fore. Mr. GUINNESS .- Honourable members know very well what that is worth with mem- bers like the honourable member for Wakatipu. Will that honourable gentleman, or any other honourable member, be bound by a statement of the Premier that because he voted for the second reading of a Bill he is not to make any alterations if he thinks fit ? No one would be bound by that statement, and therefore there is no weight in the argument. The Bill has been long enough before the country and before honourable members to enable them to grasp any principle there may be in it. This is only a proper and laudable effort on the part of the Premier to push it ahead. If there are members in this House, particularly those who represent Road Board districts, who do not want this Bill put through, they will resort to every effort to stop the passage of the Bill, and this is one of those efforts. I feel quite certain Mr. W. Fraser that this Bill ought to be advanced a stage, and that we ought not to agree to the postponement of the debate upon it. Mr. HOGG (Masterton) .- I am really as- tonished at the character of the objections taken to the second reading of this Bill. The Premier is not proposing anything of a novel character. To listen to what has been said by the honour- able members opposite, one would think that the procedure was something unusual. What are the facts in connection with nearly every policy Bill brought up in the House? The second reading is taken before the Bill is sent along to the Committee. The system of pro forma second reading is not, in my opinion,,by any means the best one. As soon as a Bill is brought down for its second reading it is advis- able, in the interests of members and of the country, to have a discussion on its merits and the principles, and the sooner it takes place the better. What is the Premier doing ? Is he trying to curtail discussion on the Bill ? Nothing of the kind. By the method proposed, instead of having only one second-reading discussion members can have two. They can have a discussion now on the second reading. and again when the Bill is reported upon by the Committee. We are thus afforded a double opportunity of explaining our minds to the country. The members who are-I do not like to say obstructing, but who are objecting to the proposal of the Premier, are simply splitting hairs. Instead of trying to 11.30. help forward the business of the country, and this is important business, they are simply endeavouring to delay the measure, which is of infinite importance to the country settlers. They are taking the best means they possibly can to prevent the Bill being carried at as early a period as possible. Now, for my own part, I believe the country requires the Bill, and my reason for endeavouring now to prevent any unnecessary delay is to have this measure brought into operation at as early a date as possible. The second reading of the Bill is not going to interfere with the work of the Select Committee, nor yet is it going to interfere with the work of the Committee of this House. I may subscribe to the principle and vote for the second reading of the Bill, but that does not by any means tie my hands. I have a perfect right to have the Bill altered in any way I think fit if I can carry out alterations in Committee. By voting for the second reading of the Bill members do not commit themselves beyond admitting that a measure of this kind is neces- sary, and that some reform is required. The Bill, although bulky, is of a very simple charac- ter. It simply provides that there shall be an alteration in the system of local government in the country districts, in accordance with advanced public opinion. I dare not, in speaking on the question before the House, enter into a discussion of the principles in- volved ; I am not able to discuss the Bill on the motion for the adjournment of the debate : but I certainly think this is the proper time for members to enlighten the country by giving their views on the principles embraced in this 
<page:209>
measure, and I am really surprised that honourable members with a knowledge of the requirements of the country settlers, like the honourable member for Ashley, should attempt to burke a discussion which should take place in its early stages. Mr. R. MCKENZIE (Motueka) .- Sir, I am rather surprised at the Right Hon. the Pre- mier moving the second reading of this Bill at the present stage. No one knows better than the Hon. the Premier that members can- not have grasped the merits of this Bill. In fact, some days ago a Committee was set up to consider the Bill, and at no Committee meeting was there any consideration or discussion on the merits of the Bill. Another objection was that the Committee could not possibly deal with the Bill at all under the present circum- stances except on a Monday, because the House meets on two days in the week at half-past ten. In my opinion, the Premier expressed his opin- ion very clearly when he said he would take the division as an indication as to whether mem- bers wanted the Bill or not. I take it that the Premier does not want the Bill to become law this session. It has been a standing order now for eight or ten years, and possibly it may pro- vide matter at least for members to talk about for another session. At the same time I am convinced that the country settlers want the Bill. In regard to the remarks of the honour- able member for the Grey, I think it is im- possible that he could have read the Bill. I venture to assert that he has not. Per- haps he has not even read one or two of its clauses, because he says there is no new prin- ciple in the Bill. He says it is simply a consolidation Bill. Well, Sir, it is not a con- solidation Bill, but contains many new and highly important departures from the existing law on local government. I recognise that if the House votes for the amendment moved by the member for Hawke's Bay, for the adjourn- ment of the debate, we tie ourselves up in a knot, and that we shall not be able to get any further with the Bill this session. I would therefore suggest this compromise: that the Premier should move the second reading of the Bill pro forma, which he ought to have done in the first instance, and let the honourable member for Hawke's Bay, by consent of the House, withdraw his motion for the adjourn- ment of the debate. Captain RUSSELL .- The Standing Orders will not allow it. Mr. R. MCKENZIE .-- Well, if the honour- able gentleman's motion is carried, the second reading of the Bill will not get on this session, that is clear enough. Whether it comes on or not, as a member representing a country dis- triet, and my constituents being materially concerned -if it even does not come on this session, I am prepared to vote for the adjourn- ment of the debate sooner than vote for the second reading now, or at any time until the Committee set up to deal with the Bill has a reasonable opportunity of considering it on its merits. Mr. McNAB (Mataura) .-- I think, whether it VOL. CXVII -13. was right in the first instance to go on with the discussion of this measure or not, the House has got into such a condition during the last half-hour that it would not be advisable to go on with the discussion of the main question now. I have not read the Bill carefully, and I have not made myself sufficiently familiar with it to discuss the general terms, because I was under the impression that the precedent of last year of the Municipal Corporations Act would be followed. I think, seeing that was so, and as the House has now spent a good deal of time in discussing the question of adjournment, the proposal made by the member for Motueka might with advantage be followed out. I do not see that our Standing Orders prevent it. I understand it was the member for Wellington City (Mr. Atkinson) who moved the adjourn- ment, not the member for Hawke's Bay, and, if the honourable gentleman were to withdraw his motion, I take it that. with the unanimous consent of the House, the Premier's motion might be taken as a motion for the second reading of the Bill pro forma. That motion does not require that there should not be any speech delivered when the motion is I understand it prohibits being moved. any discussion on the Bill afterwards; but it does not mean that a speech may not be delivered when the motion is made. I would support such a proposal as that if the member for Wellington City could see his way to withdraw his motion for adjournment. It would put the House in a better frame of mind for discussing the subject : and those members who considered that the scheme of last year would be carried out are surely entitled to some con- sideration, because we all have these local bodies in our districts who are affected by the measure. That, I admit, may be touching on a discussion of the Bill. At any rate, I think that, under the circumstances, there is all the more necessity that the question should be dealt with in a way that would not set one part of the House against the other, because, as a matter of fact, there is no party feeling in the question at all. I do not suppose that any member on either side of the House allows his party feelings to enter into the question of local government at all, and I hope the honourable gentlemen who have moved motions this morning will come to a modus rivendi. and let us get on with the business. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- Sir, might I be allowed to say that what I fear more than any- thing else is - Mr. J. ALLEN .- Has the Premier not already spoken to the question ? Mr. SPEAKER .- Yes, he has done so, but I take it he is now making, with the indulgence of the House, a proposal that may lead to a compromise in respect to the second reading of the Bill. Mr. SEDDON .- I wish to say that I never gave any pledge that the second reading should be moved pro forma. I said we would not take it that members' voting on the second reading would pledge them to the principles of the Bill. We know there are differences of opinion with respect to portions of it, and these differences 
<page:210>
has been sprung on me in the motion for the adjournment of the debate, because I have not been informed by members on either side of the House that in moving the second reading I said anything about moving the Bill mo forma. Hon. MI MBERS .- Oh, yes. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- You promised it. Mr. SEDDON .- I did nothing of the kind. I could not accept the motion for the adjourn- ment of the debate. I may say at once that if the House thinks it can better conduct the Government business, and say how and when Bills are to be brought in, they had better fix upon another man to be at the helm. Captain RUSSELL .- Sir, I think that is going beyond the question. Mr. SPEAKER .- I understand the honour- able gentleman is making a proposal to meet the objection. Mr. SEDDON .- Sir, the honourable member ought to withdraw his motion for adjourn- ment, and I would then consider the position ; or the House could negative the motion to adjourn the debate, and I then will find a way out of the ditheulty. I wish to avoid friction I want to keep them together with members. to get the Bill through; but the motion to adjourn the debate would not help in that direction. Mr. ATKINSON (Wellington City) .-- Might I be allowed, with the indulgence of the House -the same indulgence that was allowed to the Premier to say, in reference to the suggestion of the Premier and in reference to the sugges- tions of the honourable member for Mataura and the honourable member for Motueka, that I have great pleasure in withdrawing my motion if the House consents? When moving the amendment I had no idea of obstructing the Bill or the general business. Therefore if the House will give me leave to withdraw the amendment for the adjournment of the debate, in order that the suggestion of the member for Motueka may be agreed to, and that the Bill may be read a second time pro forma, I shall have very great pleasure in withdrawing my amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton). - When the Premier introduced this Bill on the 2nd July he gave the House the assurance that the Government intended to take the same course in respect to it that they did in regard to the Municipal Corporations Bill of last year. The course then adopted was that the second read- ing was taken pro forma. Now, nobody knows better than the member for the Grey that there can be no discussion of a second-reading nature, unless the second reading is taken pro forma, when the Bill comes back from the Counties Committee. But what I desire to point out to the Premier is that earlier in the session he . gave an assurance that not only the County Councils should be able to discuss this matter, but that a Conference, which should consist of representatives of Road Boards and other local bodies interested, as well as of County Councils, should have an opportunity of going into its Mr. Seddon Now, no such Conference has been held. What did happen was this : A Conference of members of County Councils sat in Wellington to consider the Bik, and at least one of the Canterbury members-namely, the member for Ellesmere - who went as a delegate of a Road Board, was refused permission to take any part in its pro- ceedings, and was told that he could only remain there by courtesy. Now, what becomes of those Road Boards in the County of Selwyn, for instance, where the Counties Act is not in operation at all? There the system of local government is carried out by Road Boards. Then, at an earlier part of the session the question was raised by the member for Geral- dine as to whether Town Boards interested in the Bill were to be allowed to take part in the proposed Conference, and the Premier said he hoped that the Conference would include dele- gates not only from Road Boards, but from Town Boards, whose interests should also be represented in connection with this matter. Under these circumstances, I certainly think that the Bill is being pushed on too hastily, and that the general body of people, who are in- terested more in the form of Road Board govern- ment than of county government, have not had any voice in the conference on the Bill. I do not hesitate to say that I prefer the Road Board system of local government to the county sys- tem. In my opinion, the counties do not pro- vide a really efficient form of local government, and the attempt that has been made year after year in this House to set up some kind of bastard form of county system, which is neither " fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red-herring," seems to me to be one of those things which emanate from the Premier's brain, because on the West Coast they hardly know what a Road Board is. There they have the county system, and that is why the enthusiasm of the member for the Grey is so strong on that point. Mr. GUINNESS .- Why, the Premier entered politics through a Road Board. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL. - But he would not- have been where he is to-day if he had stayed on a Road Board. It was through the county system the Premier was raised to the Premier- ship of the colony. Mr. SEDDON .- I was in the Provincial Council. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL. - Yes ; I think the member for the Grey can remember some of the i incidents that happened when the Premier was a member of the Provincial Council. If the honourable member will take his memory back to those days, I think he will remember that the Premier was as smart then in managing the Provincial Council as he is now in managing this House. Mr. GUINNESS .-- Hear, hear. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL. - I am glad to hear that the honourable gentleman agrees with that, and I think that some of the incidents that hap- pened in those days show that the Premier was quite as astute long before he attained to tho Premiership as he is now. There is no doubt that the powers conferred by this Bill are very 
<page:211>
local forms of government are concerned. believe that the people of this colony would be prepared to part with the county system before they would be prepared to part with the Road Board system ; and, that being the case, it seems to me most unfair that the Road Boards of the colony should have had no voice in considering the Bill. I think the Premier is doing wrong in pushing on the Bill in the way proposed, in view of the answers be gave to the honourable member for Avon and myself earlier in the session as to members of other local bodies being consulted or taking part in the Conference. I do not intend to discuss the general principles of the Bill, because, like other members, I honestly admit, owing to the consideration I have given to the Land for Settlements Bill and other measures, I have not had time to read through this Bill. That being the case, I think we ought to have a fair opportunity of going into the provisions of the Bill and mastering them, and see how they affect our own constituents. In my own electorate there are two large road districts, both of them more wealthy than many County Conneils in the North Island. I think the representatives of those Boards should have the opportunity of expressing their opinion as to how this Bill will affect them. I certainly think the Road Boards should have an oppor- tunity of having their voice heard with respect to this Bill. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .-- As to the state- ment I made to the House in respect to follow-  ing the same course which I took regarding another Bill, I distinctly said at the time that it would be referred to a Committee. The question of a pro forma second reading was not in my mind at all. If the honourable member will show me where I said I would introduce the Bill pro forma I shall apologize to the House. I had no intention of moving the second read- ing of the Bill pro forma ; had I so intended it would have appeared on the Order Paper in that form. I myself thought we would get over the second reading. I find now that we are in this position : that we shall have a prolonged debate, and that we shall not then be any further forward. It may cause feeling, and that is what I wish to avoid. It seems to be the general wish of the House that the second reading should be taken pro forma, otherwise it might be contended that members would be approving of the principle of the Bill as it now stands. I wish to get the Bill before the Committee as soon as possible, and I thought if we could get the second reading to-day we could have the Bill before the Com- mittee on Monday. To show the House that I want to further the passing of the Bill, I now move, That it be read a second time pro forma. I will thus get over the difficulty, and there are few difficulties that I cannot get over, particularly when I have the House unani- mously with me. lask leave to withdraw my motion for the second reading, and to move that the Bill be read a second time wro for mot. Captain RUSSELL .- What position shall I the Bill ? I Mr. SPEAKER .- There can be no further de- bate on the question to read the Bill a second time pro forma. When the Bill comes from Committee the second reading debate will take place on the motion for going into Committee on the Bill. Motion to read the Bill a second time with- drawn. Mr. . SEDDON .- I now move the second read- ing pro forma, and the remarks I made on my former motion I repeat without taking up the time of the House. Bill read the second time pro forma. Mr. SEDDON. - I now move, That the Bill be referred to the Local Government Committee, and I hope, having met honourable members as I have met them this morning, I shall not be twitted with having run away from my Bill, be- cause I tell the House there are certain depar- tures made in the Bill which we deem to be in the best interests of the colony. I shall take the course in respect to it which I believe to be the usual one in respect of any matter where we consider the country is entitled to progressive legislation. I want to have this Bill dealt with entirely outside party ; but at the same time, as Minister in charge of the Bill, I do not intend to bring in a Bill and later on to have another Bill, one so changed as to depart from the general principle of the Bill as introduced; and I think it best to get a perfect measure by referring it to this Committee. In the selection of the Com- mittee there has been a choice made in respect to those who have had experience in local government, whether they may Le in favour of the Bill or against it. It will then be for the local bodies interested to make their representa- tions to the Committee. There has been plenty of time for any conference to be held. The County Councils Conference was held on the 16th, and if the Road Boards could not have held their Conference in the three weeks from the time I mentioned that a conference should be held it is no fault of this House. We cannot postpone and procrastinate because they have not taken action. They will still be in a posi- tion to make their views known to the Commit- tec, so that they will not be deprived of their right. Mr. TANNER (Avon) .- Sir, on the motion that this Bill be referred to the Committee, I may say that I disagree with the last state mont in the speech just made by the Premier. In the early days of the session communications reached the Premier through various members of the House, including myself, asking whether the members of Road Boards or Road Boards collectively would be allowed to have any opportunity of conferring with regard to the operation of this Bill on their particular fune- tions. The Premier said he would give a con- ference of representatives or any one interested an opportunity to discuss the proposals. His statement that during the last three weeks there has been ample time for a conference of representatives to be held is, I think, scarcely 
<page:212>
is a letter, dated 16th July, from one of the most intelligent and capable gentlemen engaged in local government in Canterbury - and we have many such gentlemen in Canterbury. He writes :- "It is a pity that Road Boards were not invited to attend at the same time as County Councils. The latter's representatives will have first say, and probably Road Boards will be forgotten altogether. It will be a great mistake if Road Boards are abolished, as I think it would be impossible for road districts to be controlled by County Councils." No doubt the gentleman in writing these words was under a misapprehension. The various members who constituted the County Councils Conference belonged to a kind of association, to a meeting of which the Pre- mier probably had no right to invite the re- presentatives of Road Boards, and on which the representatives of Road Boards would have had no locus standi if they had presented them- selves. But, all the same, the difficulty re- mains; and when the position was explained to this gentleman, he writes to this effect on the 26th July, some seven days ago :- "I have convened a conference of all Road Boards in the County of Selwyn for the 31st instant, to consider the Bill, and to urge that representatives may meet in Wellington." As it was impossible for the Road Boards to gather their representatives together to con- sider the proposed Bill until they were apprised of the position, they appear to have been unfor- tunate enough to assume that their represen- tatives would be allowed to meet with the County Councils Conference, which was a mistaken idea. But as soon as they were seized of the fact they commenced moving in the South in the direction of having a separate and independent conference of Road Board representatives only. It is impossible for a conference summoned for the 31st instant to be in a position to forward any recommenda- tion or objection or approval of the Bill at so early a date as the 2nd August, and I would ask the Premier not to unduly attempt to press the passage of the Bill through the special Committee appointed to deal with it, but to allow a reasonable time to elapse, in order that representations from those bodies may reach the House and the Government. In spite of the fact that the County Councils Conference has adjourned, and all its members have sought their respective homes, members of the House, except through the fragmentary reports which have appeared in the newspapers, are not ap- prised of their work or their sentiments with regard to the Bill. No report has been laid be- fore us. It was urged early in the session, and promised by the Premier, that the Bill should not be dealt with until the Conference had been held. Of course, members held the reasonable assumption of the meaning of such a promise was that the passage of the Bill would be de- laved till the members of this House were seized of the recommendations which might come from the Conference. As that has not Mr. Tanner make a promise which may be kept in the letter, but which is being broken in the spirit unless the House gets time to know the objections which constitute a formidable proportion of the list of resolutions passed at the Conference. I do not wish in the least degree to oppose the passage of the Bill; I am heartily with the Premier in getting our local government put on a more satisfactory footing than it has been in the past ; but I hope nothing in the form of a surprise will be sprung on local authorities, and that they will be made well aware of what is proposed to be done before the Bill is actually passed into law. We have had several instances during the past year of the manner in which local authorities have been expressing surprise at some of the legisla- tion of last year ; and, though if we waited to pass a Bill until every one knew exactly what we were doing we should never pass any Bill at all, that is no reason why the Premier should not give reasonable facilities for these particular local bodies to be apprised of the proposals that have been laid before the House. Mr. McNAB (Mataura) .- It was mentioned in the preceding discussion that when this Bill was referred to the Committee the Committee should sit on Monday. I hope that in voting on the matter it will be understood that that is to be so. An Hon. MEMBER .- It has not been men- tioned. Mr. McNAB .- I am glad that is not the un- derstanding : because members might run away with the idea that that arrangement had been come to, and when the Committee is sum- moned the unfortunate Chairman would have to bear the brunt of any mistake. I hope there is no understanding that the Committee is to be called together on Monday. Mr. SEDDON. -- Oh, ves. Mr. McNAB .- If the honourable gentleman thinks that is so. it will be as well to have the matter definitely settled, so that we may know what is going to be done, 12.0. as you are aware the Committees now do not sit except on Wednesdays and Thursdays. On Tuesdays and on Fridays the House is occupied during the forenoon, and unless there is some distinet understanding given now with regard to the wish of the Com- mittee tomeet on a certain day they will not ba summoned until Wednesday morning at half- past ten. Mr. FLATMAN (Geraldine) .- I only wish to say a few words to indorse the remarks of the honourable member for Avon, when the honourable gentleman asked that the Road Boards might have representation : and I ask that Town Boards might also have repre- sentation on the Committee. We had a kind of promise from the Premier to that effect, and I took it upon myself to write to the Chairman of the Town Board within my dis- trict, and also to the Chairmen of the Road Boards, with the exception of one, and that Chairman is the Chairman of the County Council also, and I knew that he would be 
<page:213>
in Wellington. I told them of the day the Conference was to sit, but whether the Coun- cillors would permit them to mingle with them was a question that would have to be decided by the Conference. It is in con- sequence of what has fallen from one mem- ber that I make these remarks, as I under- stand the honourable member for Ellesmere appeared on behalf of a Road Board and was not allowed to vote ; consequently that led me to think that the Road Boards had no repre- sentation at all, and I think that they really ought to have some consideration. I might say that, in reply to a letter I sent to one Chairman, he wrote me as follows :- "I am not particularly anxious as to what becomes of the Road or Town Boards, but I do think the smaller local bodies are entitled to be heard, and their opinions are entitled to just as much consideration as members of County Councils." Now, I think that this is a fair argument, and that the Chairmen of the Town Boards aud of the Road Boards have not had the oppor- tunity of laving their views before this House, or before the Committee that is to deal with the Bill. I trust the Premier will see his way, in some way or another, to provide for these Chairmen laying their views before the Com- mittee or by meeting in conference. Of course, there is no objection to their coming to a con- ference, but, then, we have already heard it stated that they were not allowed to speak or  vote at the County Conference, and some pro- vision should be made for them to be able to express themselves with regard to the altera- tions that are likely to occur through the passing of this Bill. Mr. LANG (Waikato) .- It is not my inten- tion to delay the House, but there seems to be some mistake in reference to the Conference of the County Councils lately held in Wellington. It has been generally admitted that that Con- ference has done a large amount of good work, and the Premier himself, when the delegates from the Conference waited upon him, ad- mitted that they had done good work, and had gone very carefully into the business; but I regret that other local bodies were not repre- sented at that Conference, and I wish to point out that it is not the fault of the County Councils Conference. It was generally sup- posed that the Conference was called together by the Premier. It was nothing of the sort. It was the usual meeting of the Conference which is held from time to time. I believe this was the fifth meeting of that Con- ference. It is certainly true they did not meet last year, or the year before, because they understood that there was no legislation going to be introduced dealing with the local bodies, and therefore they did not meet ; but immediately they heard that there was a likelihood of the Local Government Bill being passed through the House this session the Con- ference was called together, but certainly it was not called together either by the Govern- ment or the Premier. But the Premier rather misled the people in the country, because they understood, as did the member for Geraldine, and also the member for Avon, that other local bodies were to be represented. The Premier stated, in other words, "Let them all come" ; and I have had letters from different local bodies asking whether the Premier was going to call this Conference together, and whether he was going to pay the expenses of the Conference ? Every county in the colony is entitled to send delegates to the Conference, and to have one vote. Where the Counties Act is not in force the combined Road Roards of that county are entitled to exercise one joint vote. And there is another thing that the honourable member for Geraldine is mistaken in. Every local body is allowed out of courtesy to send a representa- tive to the Conference, and those representa- tives are also allowed to speak, but under the rules of the association they are not allowed to vote. Mr. FLATMAN .- I never knew that. Mr. LANG .- But that is the fact. I may also point out that there was no wish on the part of the County Councils Conference to ex- clude members of the other local bodies. It was not within their power to call them together. It was simply a Conference of the County Councils, and the Road Boards of such counties where the Act was hung up. I merely rose for the purpose of explaining these points. Mr. RHODES (Ellesmere) .- I only rise to explain my action with regard to my attendance at the Conference referred to in this discussion. Relying on what the Premier stated, that mem- bers of the Road Boards should be asked to attend that Conference, I communicated with as many Road Boards as I could in my district, and asked them if they could be represented at the Conference. I attended the Conference myself, and handed in a letter appointing me as dele- gate of the Halswell Road Board, and the secretary said, "Oh, you merely represent a Road Board ; I will see the Chairman." When the question of voting arose I asked the Chair- man for a ruling on the matter, and he ex- plained that as I was only there by courtesy I could not be allowed to vote. As the honour- able member for Waikato has stated, I might have taken part in the discussions, but as I had no power to exercise a vote I thought I might as well be attending to my parliamentary duties in the House. I also understood that we should be in possession of a report of the discussions at the Conference before this Bill came on for its second reading in the House. As the member for Avon has said, the Road Boards had no voice whatever in the matter. In the Selwyn County there are no less than seventeen Road Boards, and in the Akaroa County there are seven, and they had no voice whatever in the Conference. I hope that the Road Boards will form a Conference of their own, and then put their views on the Counties Bill before us. Mr. BUDDO) (Kaiapoi). - I do not wish to delay the passage of the Bill. I hope, however, the Premier will not insist on hastily forcing this Bill through Parliament, so that time may be given the local bodies to protest against any 
<page:214>
of the provisions which they think may operate local bodies with regard to the Bill that no to their disadvantage. I happen to represent a district where there are practically three dif- ferent local bodies exercising jurisdiction in the same area, and it is very obvious that these local bodies will each require to study how it will affect their respective local interests before they can offer an opinion. I have not heard of objections, except that a wish is expressed that local bodies should not be too large ; but they naturally wish to know the whole of the pro- visions of the Bill, and to study its effect on their particular local bodies. No doubt, as the report of the Counties Conference is published, they have heard something about the provisions of the Bill, and, as most of them have copies of the Bill, I think there is reason to believe those interested understand the Bill. I think the Bill will be useful in some parts of the colony, however much we may disagree as to its various details, especially where the Counties Act is not in operation, and I only express the hope that its passage through the House may not be unduly hastened. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin). - I hope the sug- gestion that the Local Government Committee should sit on Mondays will not be agreed to, because with the present arrangements for the sitting of the House on two mornings in each week members have not sufficient time to attend to their correspondence and business in connection therewith, and matters will be very much worse if this Committee were to sit on  Mondays. Sooner than that it should sit on Mondays, I would suggest that on Tuesdays and Fridays the House should sit at half-past two, and adjourn at midnight, and allow the Local Government Committee to sit in the forenoons. I would suggest that to the Premier. Just a word about the representatives of Road Boards at the recent County Councils Conference. As stated by the honourable member for Wai- kato, the representatives of the Read Boards were treated with every courtesy at that Con- ference. They were allowed to express their opinions, but they were not entitled to vote, except in those cases where the County Councils Act was suspended, as in the County of Manu- kau, for instance, for which I was entitled to vote as the representative of the Road Boards in that county, and in the County of Eden, for which my friend Mr. Bollard appeared, and so on. But I would suggest to the Premier that he should make known publicly that the evidence of representatives of Road Boards will be taken by the Local Government Committee. Matters of the utmost importance to the Road Boards of the colony are dealt with in this Bill, and I think it should be made clearly known to them that their representatives will have every opportunity of expressing an opinion thercon. Mr. MONK (Waitemata) .- I wish to add a word or two to the remarks just made, that all interested in local bodies, whether County Councils or Road Boards, should be allowed to give evidence at the Committee on this Bill. I represent some local bodies in the Waitemata electorate, and I should like to express some of the opinions they have on this Bill. I think Mr. Buddo that the House is so informed of the feelings of delay such as that suggested by the honourable member for Kaiapoi is necessary. I think tho desire is that some finality should be secured this session in regard to legislation for local bodies, and automatic finance, as suggested by the Premier. and that all possible facilities should be given for despatch in the considera- tion of this Bill. Mr. MEREDITH (Ashley) .- Sir, I rise to ask the Premier, will the honourable gentle-  man inform the House if the Government has circulated copies of the Bill amongst the various local bodies likely to be affected by the legisla- tion ? An Hon. MEMBER .-- They are all over the colony. Mr. MEREDITH .- Then, if copies have been sent, if local bodies do not move in the matter no member is justified in asking for any delay in the matter of the passage of this Bill. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- I would first of all remove the impression that the Government want to take some advantage of the Road Boards. I think it is just about time one spoke plainly, and, as far as I am concerned, if people will not move, and if they think they will keep back legislation by not moving, they are making a very great mistake. On the 3rd July I said, in auswer to the honourable member for Avon, that there should be a Con- ference of Road Board representatives that should sit simultaneously with the County Councils Conference. That was on the 3rd, and the Conference of the County Councils did not sit till the 16th. And what have the Road Boards been doing? This was telegraphed throughout the colony. What were the Road Boards doing on the 16th July? Then, be- cause one or two Road Boards, or the Chairmen of certain Road Boards, did not think fit to call a Conference for the 1st July, why should we be asked to postpone our proceedings? I do not see why that should be done. I want to know why we should do it ? Mr. TANNER .- They were under the im- pression that they were invited to come up and attend that Conference in Wellington. Mr. SEDDON. --- 1 may tell you a little : secret. I received a certain communication desiring to know whether the Government would pay the expenses.  An Hon. MEMBER .- That must have come from the West Coast. Mr. SEDDON .- No, it was not from the West Coast. An Hon. MEMBER .-- It must have come from Auckland. Mr. SEDDON. - No, not from Auckland either ; perhaps you had better not inquire too closely. In answer, Sir, to the member for Port Chalmers, who asked me if Town Boards would be represented at the Conference. 1 said that the Bill would certainly affect Town Boards, and there was no objection to their sending 1 delegates the same as Road Boards. At all events, there is no well-founded grievance as far 
<page:215>
as they are concerned. Then, the next question is, When is the Committee to sit ? With a Bill of four hundred odd clauses, it has to be dealt with properly, and there is no reason why, if some members want to go home for the week's end, those who stay here should not be allowed to attend to the business of the country. An Hon. MEMBER. - We want to attend to our correspondence. Mr. SEDDON. - Is the correspondence that has to be dealt with or the Bill more important ? I say it is more important to deal with the Bill. I suppose about 75 per cent. of the correspondence is from people who are asking for billets. I think, looking at the two ques- tions -billet hunters and the Bill-the billet- hunters might be allowed to stand over until after the Bill has been attended to. At all events, the suggestion made that the Govern- ment should give up the morning sittings on two days of the week is unreasonable, for it only means six hours on Tuesdays and Fridays for Government business, and three of those hours are taken off for questions. What, then, is to come of the rest of the business ? I cannot agree to that proposal. I have had my fears that. between the influence of the Road Boards and the local bodies and one thing and another to keep things as they are, that my Bill will not be able to get very far. Hon. MEMBERS. - It will go on all right. Mr. SEDDON. - Well, it cannot get far unless the Committee get time to deal with it,  and if you take all the other Committees that there are sitting on the two free mornings of the week, I say unless we sit outside those mornings for this special Committee it is a moral impossibility to do anything. The Com- mittee must deal with this matter in a com- prehensive manner, and devote proper time to it, or one of two things will happen : It will come back to the House in an imperfect state and there will be no consensus of opinion, or there will be no Bill passed. We must suit the convenience of members as far as we can, but the Committee must sit either on Saturday or Monday, and it is my intention to ask the House to allow the Committee to sit on some day other than the sitting days of the House. I will consult members whether Monday or Saturday will be most desirable ; but unless we sit on one of these days it will be impossible to get through the Bill. It took the Counties Conference nine or ten solid days to deal with the Bill, and they only dealt with certain por- tions of it. The Select Committee will have Town Board and Road Board representatives on it. and if it took the Conference nine days to deal with it, it will take us two or three weeks at the very least. At all events, I do not wish to mislead members, and it is my intention to ask the Committee to meet outside the ordinary sitting-days. I move, That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee. Motion agreed to. TEACHERS' SALARIES COMMISSION. Mr. BOLLARD (Eden) asked, without notice, if the Premier would cause copies of the report of the Teachers' Salaries Commission to be sent to every School Committee in the colony, for the use of the Committee and teachers ? Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said the Govern- ment did not see its way clear to do that. Ho would inquire as to the probable cost. He thought every Board of Education should be provided with a copy of the report, and mem- bers of Parliament would have extra copies, and he thought they must leave it to members of Parliament to distribute copies to the School Committees. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton) asked if it would be possible for the Government to send a copy to cach head-teacher of a school. Mr. SEDDON did not think it would be reasonable to expect the Government to do that. Members could send the extra copies they have to the teachers. # MR. SPEAKER. Mr. SPEAKER asked that the Chairman of Committees might be allowed to take his place for the remainder of the day, as he wished to proceed to Christchurch by the boat at five o'clock. He would return by the steamer on Tuesday forenoon, and the Chairman of Com- mittees had consented to act for him in his absence. He could not say that it was pub- lic business that called him away, nor yet was it pressing private business, but he might say it was a domestic matter that he wished to attend to. The House consenting, Mr. Guinness took the chair at twenty minutes to five o'clock. # GOVERNMENT ADVANCES TO SETTLERS EXTENS ON BILL. Mr. MILLS (Minister in charge of Govern- ment Advances to Settlers Office' .- Sir, in rising to move the second reading of this Bill I deem it necessary to give the House some little informa- tion about it, and for this purpose I have had a return prepared as near up to date as possible. I will explain as briefly as I can what the present position is, and then I will explain the provisions of this short but important measure. I find that up to the 22nd July the number of applications received at the office was 13,654, and the amount applied for was $4,787,608. The number of applications on which, up to the same date, advances were authorised was 10,451, and the amount was $3,437,385. Now, at this point I would briefly say that the department is one which is comparatively new yet, and I hope honourable members will be generous in their criticism if there should have been a few mistakes in valuations, or if the advances seemed to err on the side of caution, because no large business could be carried on without something of that kind occurring. Therefore I ask that the most charitable construction- Mr. SEDDON .- Not " charitable." Mr. MILLS .- Well, Sir, if you dislike the term I will withdraw the word, although I had not finished my sentence and conveyed its true meaning ; but I hope in any criticism from any member of this House that they will acknow- ledge that in starting a large business of this 
<page:216>
some small mistakes which I have referred to on the part of the valuers. But there have been very few errors indeed ; and I will also say at this moment, that, at any rate, the Superintendent of the Advances to Settlers Office and his officers have done their very best to keep clear of anything of the kind ; and I am satisfied that those who look into the system of working will acknowledge that the office has done its work in a first-class business way, and that it is an office which has come to stay. The number of applicants asking for advances from the office proves clearly what a satisfactory Government measure it is, and how well it has been appreciated in the country districts since its introduction. The number of ad- vances declined up to the 22nd July of this vear is 1,260, and they have been declined for various reasons which I need not go into. The Board have a discretionary power which The they are bound by statute to exercise. amount authorised and accepted by applicants was 9,991 applications, representing a sum of no less than $2,253,778; so that members will see the advances have reached a very large sum indeed, and that it has, generally speaking, given great satisfaction throughout the country. Now, referring to the measure I have brought forward, if members will look at it they will find in clause 2 that we are asking for power to raise an additional loan of two millions sterling. The present position of the office is this : there is a balance to be raised under the last statute of $760,000, but there is a sum of  $200,000 already pledged against that amount, and the annual working of the office repre- sents in round numbers about $500,000. As this power, which was formerly given by Par- #cc-zero liament, will expire in October next, it is necessary for the House to make provision as suggested here in the Bill. If the matter were deferred the balance we should have in hand would certainly be insufficient to carry on until Parliament meets next year, as the amount I have referred to - about $500,000 - is required annually for invest- Inents. Clause 3 repeals certain parts of the various Acts now in force. In effect, the clauses which are sought to be repealed are those which bind the Government to a stated period for raising the balance of $760,000, as authorised by the principal Act. If members will refer to the Government Advances to Settlers Act of 1894 they will see that subsec- tion (4) of clause 28 refers to the time in which the Government may raise the amount, and also to the amount that may be raised. That clause is dealt with again in the Act of 1895. Clause 7 states that the Aets " shall continue in force and may be exercised until but not later than the expiration of three years from the coming into operation of the Act." There- fore it is necessary that these clauses should be repealed. The other section alluded to is in the Act of 1898. Clause 2 of that Act says that the Act shall " continue in force and inay be exercised until but not later than the thirty-first day of October, one thousand Mr. Milis Act or any amendment thereof to the contrary not withstanding." Therefore, honourabie mem- bers will see the reason for bringing in this Bill, and for increasing the amount we can borrow, is simply to meet the exigencies of the case. A great number of settlers in all parts of the colony have taken advantage of the means by which they can acquire loans or transfer their mortgages, and it is necessary that Parliament should be in a position to provide accordingly. I therefore have much pleasure, Sir, in moving the second reading of the Bill. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- Will the honourable gentleman state what the cash balance to the credit of the account was on the 31st March ? Captain RUSSELL .- $29,872. Mr. MILLS .-- I cannot give the exact figures at present, as I have not got the last balance- sheet before me, but I think it is less than that amount. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) .- I do not propose to discuss the principle of the original Act. I Want to say a few words with regard to this amending Bill ; and I am sorry that the honour- able member who moved the second reading of the Bill has had to apologise for the legislation, and to ask us to treat it in a charitable manner. I have no doubt we shall be charitable. Mr. SEDDON .- He withdrew it. Mr. J. ALLEN .- Yes, but he withdrew it on instruction from the Premier. The Premier's instructions, however, came a little too late. He ought to have schooled his child a little carlier in the day before he came down to make his speech on the second reading. Sir, we will be charitable as to the Act, and charitable to the honourable gentleman. We have no desire in this House to be otherwise than charitable to him. I desire to say a few words with regard to the amending Bill. It proposes to give power to the Government to raise another two millions under the Government Advances to Settlers Act. It goes further than that, and does away with the restriction which has always been placed in our legislation up till now. The legislation providing for the raising of money under the Government Ad- vances to Settlers Act has hitherto always pro. vided a limit of time. That limit of time now is to be done away with, and it will be competent for the Government to raise an extra two millions and the balance of the loan which has already been authorised at any time-even ten years hence -- if it is not raised within the period that the ten years expires. I do not know that there is any serious objection to that, so long as the policy contained in the original mea- sure remains a safe one. We cannot tell yet -- and I do not suppose we shall be able to tell for a certain number of years -- how safe or unsafe this policy has been, and I feel that it was wise that Parliament should have placed a restriction upon the time during which these loans might be raised -- a restriction which was really a pre- caution -- so that if it was discovered later on that there was any likelihood of the legislation being injurious to the colony, or was likely to 
<page:217>
result in great loss, there was an opportunity of stopping the continual borrowing. But the honourable gentleman in charge of the Bill has not shown the House the necessity for raising another two millions. The loans granted during the last few years under the Act have been gradually falling off, and of necessity they must fall off. As the gap was filled up, it must have been patent to every one that those re- quiring loans under the Act would be gradually decreasing, and so that has been the result. The amounts have been gradually decreasing. And it is fair to assume that in years to come the amounts will still further decrease. Under the Act there was authority to raise three mil- lions, and the honourable gentleman informed us that there remains $760,000 of the old loan to be raised. I do not know where he got his information from. I suppose from the officers of the department, and one must therefore ac- cept that statement as correct, although it does not correspond with the balance-sheets as placed before the House. I have looked at the balance- sheets, and I find that of the loan there has been raised $2,350,000, leaving a balance of $620,000 only to be raised. Of course, the honourable gentleman might use the argument that that would strengthen his contention in asking for authority to raise more. I dare say the honour- able gentleman is referring to £140,000 which has not been subscribed. but which has been raised all the same under short-dated debentures. There has been inscribed as a loan $2.240,000, but if honourable members will look at the balance sheet as given in Gazette No. 48, they will find that there are temporary advances on the security of short-dated debentures to the amount of $140,000, so that of the loan there has been raised £2,380,000, and I cannot under- stand why the honourable member should tell the House that £760,000 is available, because it is in direct contravention of the accounts that have been placed before us. Mr. SEDDON. - The money can be raised and set aside without being advanced. There must be a certain amount in hand. Mr. J. ALLEN .- That will not affect the present loan. I understand the Premier to say that money may be raised and set aside. Mr. SEDDON .- It may be still held. Mr. J. ALLEN .- That is not the point. The money has been raised all the same. We know that $1,500,000 was originally raised, and part invested in Government securities. Mr. SEDDON .- There was available for ad- vancing ₺760,000. Mr. J. ALLEN .- That is not what the honourable gentleman said. Mr. SEDDON .- Well, he ought to have said it. Mr. J. ALLEN .- That is another story, and I think that the Right Hon. the Premier, who was on the point of rising to move the second reading of the Bill, should have continued to do so. Mr. SEDDON .- You are wrongly stating what he said. Mr. J. ALLEN .- You admit that he ought to have said it. There is the fact that the mover of the second reading said there was $760,000 available to be raised. Mr. SEDDON. - Not " to be raised," but " $760,000 yet to be raised under the authority of the principal Act, and of this only $560,000 now remains available for investment on mort- gage." Mr. J. ALLEN. -. It is either that, or, as the accounts show, that there is $620,000 yet to be raised. And now authority is asked for another two millions. I would ask, is Parliament justified in giving authority for this sum? I do not think it is. I maintain that this Go- vermment Advances to Settlers Office is being used, as it has been in the past, not for the purposes only of Government advances to settlers but for the purposes of general govern- ment, and that this authority that we are now asked to give for two million pounds is not so much for the purposes of the Advances to Settlers Office as for the general needs of the Government. Sir, if we are to have a fresh loan let us have a straight-out one. Let it be for aid to public works if you like, or for the purposes of Native lands or land improvement, but to utilise the Government Advances to Settlers Office for the general needs of the Go- vernment is not the right way to do it. I say it is better to be straightforward. It can- not be shown that there is any need of $2,000,000, for last year a little over $500.000 of advances was made by this office. That does not, however, represent the real require- ments, for there were repayments to the extent of over $155,000. Therefore, the real require- ments of the office were under $400,000. The advances on mortgage last year were $539,000, but the repayments amounted to $155,237, so that the real requirements of the office so far as loans were concerned were under $400,000. We may assume that that amount will decrease each year, partly because fewer loans will be re- quired and partly because repayments are going on all the time. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the requirements of the office will decrease from $400,000 to say $300,000 in a very short time. That being the case, we have available -so the Minister says-$760,000 of the old loan. That, I take it, will see us through two years from now, and I cannot understand why any fresh loan is being asked for this year. If there is any real necessity for a fresh loan it cannot be said that there is any necessity for two millions, and I think Parliament should halt especially at a time like this, before it gives authority for another two million loan for the Advances to Settlers Office. This is not the right time to go on the market. And I am quite certain that all the requirements of the office for another year, and I believe for another two years, will be met by the authority given under the Act of 1894. Mr. SEDDON .-- Oh, no. Mr. J. ALLEN .- The honourable gentleman cannot say it is not so. Even if the advances are half a million this year that is in progress, there would be sufficient of the old loan to ad- vance that half million to carry us on for another year. It has not been proved to us that there 
<page:218>
is a necessity for a fresh loan, at any rate ; nor is it the right time for us now to authorise new loans unless there is absolute necessity for it. The London market is not in a condition to supply us with money at the rate we should require the money. Honourable members must recollect that the whole scheme is based upon our borrowing in London at 3 per cent., and if we go to London and borrow money at 4 per cont. for advances to settlers, there is not suffi- cient margin to pay the State. The State will lose, and the whole scheme will break down. It is a pity that it should break down, because if we have a law on the statute-book providing for such a scheme, I want to see that scheme a success, and, of course, the right honourable gentleman himself must wish to see it a suc- cess. If the honourable gentleman is in earnest about this he must know he cannot afford to pay more than 3 per cent. for his money ; and I hope Parliament will hesitate before it gives authority to borrow to such a large extent as another two millions at this par- ticular time. There is no need for it, and it is not the right time to go upon the London market for the money. The amendments pro- posed in the Bill, of course, are technical amendments. They do away with the limit of time. The amount authorised in the Bill can be raised at any time, either at once-the whole two millions-and invested in securities of the Crown, and realised for Government purposes, or the loan may be delayed for a year, or two years, or ten years, or any period whatever. I do not think it wise that the precautions which have been embodied in our legislation previously should now be done away with. I feel certain myself that Parliament would be safe in throwing out the Bill altogether-at any rate, it would be wise if we limited the loan to half, or even a quarter, of what is proposed, and when this Bill is in Com- mittee I shall myself move that the amount which is to be authorised in the Bill shall be cut down by a considerable amount. Mr. GUINNESS (Grey) .- Sir, the question when the amount of money to be authorised under this Bill should be raised is one which I think should be left entirely in the hands of the Colonial Treasurer. The mere fact of giving authority does not imply that the Co- lonial Treasurer is going to raise the money at once or at a time when he cannot carry out his financial operations to the best advantage. The honourable gentleman must have forgotten the fact that in 1899 we passed an amending Act enlarging the scope of the authority of the Advances to Settlers Act, so as to give authority for the money to be advanced upon the security of urban and suburban lands. Necessarily, a much larger demand would be made upon the money borrowed to satisfy the needs of those who require advances, honce I can see there is every necessity to give the Government what authority they require for this purpose. The credit of the colony will not be in any way pledged, nor has any detrimental effect been brought about in consequence of this scheme of lending money by the Government, be- Mr. J. Allen cause this money which is borrowed is, as the honourable member must know, fully covered by the securities taken by the department. The particular matter I rose to speak about was the injustice, under the Act of 18.9, which is being committed-unintentionally, 1 think-to the owners of property in the Town of Greymouth, which I have the honour to represent. Most of the land in that town is held under lease from the Public Trustee under the Westland and Nel- son Native Reserves Act of 1857; and, under the original " Government Advances to Settlers Act, 1-94," if lands leased under this Native Reserves Act were situated in the country the owners of such land had a right to borrow money from the Advances to Settlers Depart- ment. Then, in 1-99, the privilege was given to those who lived in townships to have the same advantages as those who lived in the country. The Advances to Settlers Office have interpreted the Act of 1899 so that these lessees who hold lands in the Town of Greymouth under the Westland and Nelson Native Reserves Act are not entitled to get advances from the office, because the land is held under these leases from the Public Trustee. Now, I maintain that if those who hold under similar conditions in the country are entitled to get loans, there can be no possible objection taken to lending money on land held under lease in townships. I have already brought the matter under the notice of the Minister, and I ask him to take it into his consideration and have the question looked into, with a view of preparing such necessary amendments of the Act of 1899 as that there will be no difficulty in those lessees who have good and ample security for advances, if they wish to avail themselves of the privilege of getting money cheaply by apply- ing to the Advances to Settlers Office. The honourable member knows that loans have been applied for ; but it has been pointed out by the office that the clauses in the Act of 1899 are not sufficiently explicit to empower the office to lend money. I do hope that no portion of the colony will be allowed to be treated so exceptionally as Greymouth is now, if the law is allowed to remain as it at present stands on the statute-book. Mr. BARCLAY (Dunedin City) .- It is not my intention to offer any very extensive remarks in regard to the policy of advances to settlers. There can be little doubt that it is highly approved of by the whole colony. Some of the arguments used by the honourable mem- ber for Bruce have already been replied to by the honourable member for the Grey, who has pointed out that very likely more money will be required under this Act now that suburban lands are being included in the operation of the Act. I should like to say I think the time has now come when even a further advance should be made, in respect to lending on urban and city properties. The honourable member for the Grey also pointed out that, although this Bill does authorise the borrowing of two millions, there is no obligation on the Government to borrow it at present or in an unfavourable market ; it merely gives the authority, and the 
<page:219>
Government may choose their own time for using it. I arose, however, chiefly to draw attention to what some might perhaps call a small grievance-I say a small one, although it is a very annoying one, and one very wide- spread - in connection with the department. What the Law Officers or the Board who has charge of the advances do is this: When a mortgage is to be discharged by the Board their officers say, " We will not issue the discharge of mortgage until we actually have the cash in hand." Now, supposing a borrower sells his property to a purchaser, he has to pay off his mortgage and hand it over to the purchaser on payment of the purchase-money. The pur- chaser says, "All right, you produce your release of the mortgage. produce your convey- ance to me, and I will hand you over the money." The Advances to Settlers Depart- ment says, " No, we will not sign any release ; we will not even execute the discharge of the mortgage until the money is actually in our possession." Well, of course, honourable mem- bers who know anything whatever about busi- ness know that this is an impossible situation. The ordinary way in which these things is done is that the discharge of mortgage is prepared, the conveyance to the purchaser is prepared, and then all the parties meet at some office on a particular day, the purchase-money is handed over, the mortgage is discharged, the deeds are released, and the whole thing is settled. But this Board says, "No, we will not do  business in that way at all ; we will not even execute the discharge of mortgage until the actual cash is in our possession." Of course, the purchaser says, "I am certainly not going to hand over my cash until I get my convey- ance executed, and until I see the discharge of the mortgage executed." There can be no ob- jection to the execution of the discharge of the mortgage, because, at all events, under the Land Transfer Act until the discharge is registered it has no effect. If the release were executed and the money was afterwards never paid it would make no difference, because, in the first instance, the receipt or discharge would always be retained in the hands of the Advances to Settlers Department ; and if it were not regis- tered, then even if it were in anybody else's hands it would be of no avail. Now, this that I have been speaking of is a case which actually occurred. There was a hitch, of course, and the result was that the solicitors acting for the mortgagee had actually to finance the matter . themselves, to find a considerable sum of money in order that the cash might be handed over to the department before they executed the release. I have here a considerable amount of correspondence on the question, which took place between the firm of solicitors who were engaged in the transaction and the Advances Department-the firm of Messrs. Bathgate and Woodhouse, of Dunedin-and I shall be happy to show the correspondence to the honourable gentleman in charge of the Bill, or to any other members interested. It is, of course, too long to read just now ; but I would ask the attention of honourable members to one passage. The solicitor wrote to the officers of the depart- ment, and said,- " For example, if the discharged mortgage be sent to the Crown Solicitor, to be handed over to us on payment of the money to the Postmaster, we shall gladly pay his costs of attending at the post-office to settle." Practically the solicitors say. "Sign the dis- charge and let the Crown Solicitor take it to the Postmaster in the district. We shall pay the money into the post - office, and we shall pay the costs of the Crown Solicitor attending at the post-office and receiving the same " ; but the department writes back and says, " On no account can we see our way to do anything of the sort, or to depart from the rules." And then the solicitors write and say,- " If the matter cannot be arranged as we re- quested in our last, we suppose we must take steps to find the money temporarily for Mr. So-and-so, and it will facilitate matters if you will at once send the certificate of title," et cetera. And steps have to be taken to find the money temporarily. Then, here is what the Superin- tendent writes :- "I have to inform you that I cannot see my way to depart from the ordinary rule of the office requiring loans to be repaid before the discharge of the relative mortgage is executed by the Board." Now, did anybody ever hear of such a thing ? It seems to me, as it must to any man of business, to be quite indefensible, and I am quite sure that the Minister will consider whether some more businesslike method of arranging this matter cannot be adopted. The solicitors, in replying, again say, -- "Supposing, however, in this instance we send the money belonging to the lender to Mr. - to pay off the mortgage to you, and before the discharge came to hand a writ of sale at the instance of some creditor of Mr. - was lodged, we should look very foolish if all we could give our client were nothing but the un- registered discharge of your mortgage for his money. We say unregistered, for to register the discharge would only put Mr. - 's creditor in a better position." And this rule is generally adopted by the department as far as I can gather. These trans- actions are continually occurring, and they pro- bably will continue to occur more frequently in the future. I suggest, therefore, and I am sure the suggestion will receive due consideration from the Minister, that the matter might well be looked into, and a more satisfactory method of arrangement come to if possible. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) .- Sir, in listening to the lengthy speech from the honour- able member who introduced this Bill we heard very little of argument in favour of the Bill. The Bill, as I take it, is an amendment of the prin- cipal Act in order to allow the department to borrow a fresh sum of $2,000,000 before spend- ing the original $3,000,000 granted to them by the Act of 1894. Now, it seems to me that the Hon. the Minister did not show any reason or cause-in fact, I do not know that he addressed 
<page:220>
himself to the subject-as to why this fresh sum of $2,000,000 should be granted at all. If you look at the history of the Advances to Settlers Act and its amendments you will see that the amending Bills of the principal Act have all been in the way of delaying the borrowing of money, instead of trying to get more money. The original Act of 1894 provided that €3,000,000 should be borrowed in two years. That brought the time up to 1896. In 1895 an Act was passed extending the time of borrowing that $3,000,000 to 1898, giving them another three years. In 1898 an Act was passed extending the time of borrowing that €3,000,000 for another three years, bringing it up to 1901; and the honour- able member in charge of this Bill admits that at the present moment they have in hand for advances to settlers a sum of $760,000. Well, Sir, it seems to me he should have addressed himself to showing why, with that sum in hand, it was necessary still further to borrow the sum of $2,000,000. Mr. MILLS .- I said there were temporary advances against it. Mr. HERRIES. - Well, the honourable mem- ber, or the Premier, in interjection, said there was $760,000 ready to be applied for advances. We all know what temporary advances are. That means that the sum is invested in temporary security, so that the department has in hand the sum of $760,000 practically at call, which they can at any time advance to the settlers. Besides that they are having every day the repayment of instalments, which they can also use for the same purpose. Now, I ask the House to read carefully, for I have not time to do so in full, the speech of Sir John Mckenzie in introducing the Bill of 1898, in which he deprecates the idea of borrowing fresh money, and in which he points out, very pro- perly, that it is a wrong thing to have power for borrowing money in a Bill unless you can invest it. To quote a portion, he says :- " It would be impossible to advance the money in the same careful and prudent way as we have been advancing the money from the Advances to Settlers Office for the last few years without extending it over a very long time. I should think it would take at least three years to get the money out in the same way as we have been dealing with the money in the past ; and, that being the case, it would be folly to borrow the whole of the money that has been passed. and pay interest on money that we cannot invest." Now, not only has Sir John Mckenzie's prophecy been fulfilled, but we still have, according to the statement of the Minister in charge of the Bill, $760,000 of the original loan that has not yet been advanced to settlers. And, as the honourable member for Bruce pointed out, the rate at which the money has been advanced does not bear out the idea expressed in this Bill. In 1899 the advances were $181,000. in 1900 they were €448,000, and in 1901 $539,000, showing that the $760,000 which is in hand is ample for a year's allow- ance. On the other hand too, we have the re- payment of instalments, which ought to be Mr. Herries considered as the same thing as loan-money, for they are available for advancing to settlers. We have these instalments steadily increasing. In 1599 they were ¥104,000; in 1900, €136,000 ; and in 1901, $155,000. Next year we may fairly expect the repayments will be $175,000, so that that will be available for lending, as well as the $760,000 that has not been raised, making a sum of £935,000 available for advances to settlers. It seems to me that sufficient can- has not so far been shown why the $2,000,000 should be borrowed. The honourable gentle- man, in introducing the Bill to us, did not ex- plain for what reason the extra money should be borrowed. The honourable member for the Grey expressed the opinion that it was required because the Act had been extended to apply to urban properties. But I would point out that that Act was passed in 1899, so there is ample opportunity of seeing whether that extension to urban properties has operated in the way the honourable member for Grey suggests. That should be shown in the returns of the opera- tions for the year ending the 31st March, but on looking at the ngures do we find a large increase in the amount lent ? On the contrary. we find a decrease. As I pointed out, in 18:9 the advances were $281,000; in 1900 they were $448,000, an increase of about £157,000; whereas last year, though the advances were $539,000, the increase on the previous year was only €90,000. Where, then, is the large increase that was to go to the urban borrowers ? It seems to me that the amendment of 1899 should have operated before now. Evidently it has either not operated at all, or it has not operated in the mode suggested by the honourable member for the Grey, and there- fore this $2,000,000 cannot be required for the reason which has been suggested by him. Of course, as far as the general policy of the measure is concerned, every one of us-and I especially-is in accord with the policy of ad- vances to settlers. I say straight out I believe it has been a benefit to settlers when properly administered. We all admit that, but are not addressing ourselves now to the main principle of the Bill. We are not, in pointing out our objections to the Bill before us, expressing our- selves in any way contrary to the general principles of the policy. We want to know the reason why this extra two millions is to be borrowed, when the department has not yet spent the three millions that was authorised in 1894. They have taken six years, and they . have not yet spent the three millions, and they have still .9760,000 left. Well, now they come down to us and say that they want another two millions. They have been six years trying to spend the three millions and have not succeeded, and I think that this House should have very cogent reasons why we should authorise them to borrow another two millions. That money, 1 believe, must be spent in advances tosettlers. I hope and trust it is not the intention to borrow and then invest the money in temporary securi- ties for the benefit of the Colonial Treasurer. I would not suggest such a thing, but I hope it will be made clear, and I wait for the Trea- 
<page:221>
clear up lingering doubts that may arise from a suspicion of that kind. I also hope that these two millions, or any part of them, are not necessary to make up any losses that have occurred, although it seems to me that in a lending department like this there will be necessity sometimes to make allowance for depreciation and bad debts. I notice in this balance-sheet that there is some suspicion of this kind that appears to me to be present. For instance, I notice among the assets, which I trust the Minister in charge when replying will explain. the following item : "Bills re- ceivable (Prior's deficiency), £1,090 11s. 7d." It seems to me that there was a deficiency some- where which has to be met by a bill. I do not know whether that is the right interpretation of it. Mr. SEDDON .- The honourable member for Rangitikei will tell you all about it. Mr. PIRANI .- That was money that was embezzled. Mr. HERRIES .- Then, if the money was embezzled, I would like to know why it is put down as an asset. Mr. LETHBRIDGE .- He is paying it back. Mr. HERRIES .- I thought we would get some explanation, but why did not the Minister in charge give it. But it looks rather peculiar to see it put in as a bill receivable, and as an asset. If the honourable member for Rangi- tikei thinks it is a good asset, well and good, and I suppose it is all right. Then, we have " Interest receivable, overdue, £4,734 6s. 7d." I do not know whether that means that the interest has not been paid up, or that it is really an asset, and is only recoverable on ap- plication. I trust the honourable member in charge of the Bill will explain that when he is replying. Now, Sir, I should like to make some reference to the question of valuation. I see according to the accounts that this department pays the Valuation Department some $2,500, and that the settlers to whom the money is lent repaid to the department the sum of $2,398, so that practically the settlers are paying the whole of the valuation. Now, Sir, I would like to ask whether it is right to charge the settlers with the valuation. When the Valuation Department was instituted, the valuation of the Valuation Department was to be taken as the valuation under which loans to settlers were to be granted. Now, Sir, any one cognisant with the case knows that that does not take place, and that the valuations of the Valuation Department are not accepted as the valuations under which loans shall be granted, and that fresh valuatious are made, for which the unfortunate settler has to pay, whether he gets the loan or not. I say that when the Valuation Department was set up it was in- tended that the valuations of that department should be accepted by this office, and it seems to me, therefore, that it is wrong to charge the settler with the cost of the Valuation Department. The country settler is not only taxed in his rates for the cost of the Valuation Department, since the local bodies ment, but also again when he borrows money he is taxed to pay for the cost of the Valuation Department. He is got at in two or three ways to keep up this department. If these valua- tions are not accepted by the department, why should the settler be obliged to pay for fresh ones, and why should the department not go and look at the rate-book, where these valua- tions made by the same department are to be f und, and the advances lent on those valua- tions which would not cost a penny ? An Hon. MEMBER. - The borrowers would not like that sometimes. Mr. HERRIES .- That is so ; but I point out how the borrower gets had. He very often thinks that the value is too small if he wants to borrow; but he does not think it is too small when he is paying the rates. This is what happens : A settler applies for a loan, and a fresh valuation is made, because he thinks the value in the rate-book is too small. A fresh valuation is made, the amount is raised, and very often the loan is not granted ; but the valuation goes into the rate-book, and the unfor- tunate settler, though he does not get his loan, has to pay higher rates. That is a matter of general complaint in the district I come from. I cannot see why any charge should be made for the valuation, considering that it is done by a Government department. Of course, if a special valuation has to be made, then there is provision in the Valuation Act by which any one who applies for a special valuation can get it on payment of the special charge. I think that is all right. But where the department goes right through the county and makes a valuation, and charges the county for it, those valuations should be accepted by the Advances to Settlers Department, and the borrower should not be charged for the valuation, because they can be obtained without any fresh charge. The local bodies are charged for the valuation, and the settler should be exempt. I am sorry to see no amendment in that direction in this Bill. It is a matter of very common complaint in the country districts. As far as this Bill is concerned, it is largely a technical Bill to borrow two millions; but I think we are entitled to have some explanation as to what is to be done with that money, and as to the necessity of why this money should be borrowed at all. It seems to me that the department have got enough of the $3,000,000 already raised to last for two or three years, certainly enough to last for one year, and this Bill might well be relegated to next session till we see how the accounts stand. especially as we know that the financial position is very strained indeed. Hints have been dropped by the Premier of further taxation on the land, and we are now asked to consent to the further borrowing of $2,000,000, without the slightest bit of necessity having been shown for it by the member in charge of the Bill or any one else. It cannot be argued that the extension of the 1899 Act has anything to do with it because, as I have shown, the advances have not in- creased in proportion since that Act was passed. 
<page:222>
tween $400,000 and $500,000, and we have still got $760,000 in hand, and no reason has been shown why we should borrow more money at all. Mr. MONK (Waitemata). - There is one matter, Sir, which excites my interest, and upon which no satisfaction has been afforded by what previous speakers have said. It is proposed to borrow this two millions of money at the high rate of interest which the lenders will now demand-not less than 10 per cent. If so, will the rate at which the Government will lend the money under the Advances to Settlers Act be sufficient to cover the cost of the lending under that Aet ? These are questions which I should like to have answered. I know the Premier does not expect me to vote for this measure. He knows that in such matters as this I go upon principle, and my belief is that we are unnecessarily interfering with private enterprise under the Advances to Settlers Act. No statement made by the supporters of the Government or by those who have advocated the Act-audaciously made, I might say-as to the lowering of the rate of interest, has affected my mind in the slightest degree, because I know that many money-lenders have been advertising and continuously lending money at a lower rate of interest than the Govern- ment have been doing under the Advances to Settlers Act. And, as I have mentioned before, the Government are operating at a very unfair advantage over private enterprise, as these private money-lenders have to pay 1d. in the pound, or equivalent to land-tax, upon their loans. The Government are announcing that they are lending money at a lower rate of interest than private enterprise, but they exempt themselves from the land-tax which is paid by the private lenders, who, on the two millions of money, would have to pay not less than $8.300 per annum. I say, therefore, it is inequitable in principle and it is unfair in its practice; and, while I objected to it from the very first. I more especially do so now, when I believe the Government cannot borrow money at a sufficiently low rate of interest to advance to settlers without liability of loss to the tax- payers. There is no doubt that this borrowing . of two millions of money will bring capital into the country; and no doubt it will enable the Minister for Railways at some future function, such as he was at the other evening, to announce the increased amount of money lying at deposit in the banks, and the plethora of cash there is at the present time. Of course, the sixteen or eighteen millions of money that we have bor- rowed of late years must of necessity be added to the deposits in the banks - a bad sign that they cannot put it to better use-and this money will help in the same direction. Then, I want to know whether this two millions of money is merely for the purpose of keeping the banking account free or in credit with moneys received under this Bill. There is no doubt that they have already sated with their advances to settlers those who are needing to borrow on the kind of securities which will induce the Go- Mr. Herries opportunities of lending money against private enterprise in the future than in the past. But I admit the Government will be able to confer this benefit on the country : that they will be able to keep buoyant their public works policy by the lending of this money on short-dated securities, and even keep advancing in abeyance. There is nothing easier, as we have seen in many instances, in the case of persons who have applied for loans and have been refused on the plea that the security was not sufficient. The would-be borrowers have afterwards dis- posed of their properties at a much higher rate than the security which the Government professed to require, and they were forced to place themselves in the unfortunate position of having to sell their homesteads. This I know to have taken place. But, while I say the Go- vernment has not been lending money at as low a rate as private enterprise, there has been this feature, and the only one that I will allow to he of advantage to settlers: that they have lent money in the country districts where the ex- perience of private enterprise is adverse to placing loans, because in the past many have been unfortunate in so doing. We know there have been times -and we cannot be sure that those times will not come again-when country securities have fallen, and the money-lenders have been surprised at the shrinkage of their securities ; and there only requires to be a lower- ing in the value of land for the Government to find out that their securities may be too near in value to the amounts loaned upon them. In the first place, as I have stated, I consider we are without benefit in interfering with private enterprise, and it should be the policy of any Administration in any country to as far as possible avoid interference with private en- terprise, provided it does not in any way encroach on the interests and well-being of the community. We knew money is being bor- rowed at the rate of 4 and 4} per cent., and that the money-lenders have to pay land-tax. And mark the difference between the 5 and 6 per cent. which the Government must neces- sarily demand for the advances they will make under the Advances to Settlers Aet and the rates demanded by the private money-lenders. Those are a few of the questions which I should like to have fairly answered. No doubt the Right Hon. the Premier will endeavour to obscure the issues, as we know he is so clever in doing. Why can he not give us a genuine exposition of the state of affairs ? We want to know whether this money is required for th . purpose of keeping his banking buoyant. and in the hope of postponement and to cover the tightness which he neces-arily has to suffer under the present condition of the country, or whether he really believes it a benefaction to settlers. Mr. SEDDON (Premier). - Probably it might. facilitate the passing of the Bill, and allow the [ House to get on with some other business, if I say now that this is purely a borrowing B.Il. It has nothing whatever to do with the adminis- tration of the Advances to Settlers Depart- 
<page:223>
authority to raise $2,000,000, not raising more than $1,000,000 in any one year. That is really what you are asked to do in the Bill. Nothing more nor less. Formerly Parliament gave the right to raise £3,000,000 without any safeguards or restrictions. An Hon. MEMBER .- As to time ? Mr. SEDDON. - Well, I shall come to that ; but I wish now to say that it is advisable in the interests of our borrowing that we should have an extension of time, and that we should not be fixed to a definite time, more especially at the present juncture. Honourable mem- bers have taken the returns laid upon the table, and from them we have had different amounts given as to the money available. In fact, the honourable member for Bruce, I think it was, made out the amount available on the 31st March to be $400,000. Mr. J. ALLEN .- I said that the amount now out-borrowed was £620,000. Mr. SEDDON. - On the 31st March last the But amount not then raised was $760,000. the honourable member will not find it in the accounts at all. The amount, as I say, not raised was $760,000. The amount avail- able on the 31st March was only $560,000. Now, honourable members will find that at the rato we are lending-approximately you may put it down at $500,000 and $560,000 being available on the 31st March, if you take six months of that there is $250,000 gone, or, in round numbers, a quarter of a million. Take the use of that between the 31st March last and the 31st March next, and An Hon. MEMBER .- What about the repay- ments ? Mr. SEDDON .- They may come in or they may not; but at most those will not reach £100,000. But is that the manner in which you are going to run the Advances to Settlers Department ? Are the advances to future bor- rowers to depend on the amount that is to come in? Is that what is asked to be 3.0. done? I do not think so. I say straight out we are lending now at the rate approximately of half a million a year. If you look at the return here you will see your authorities have been £3,600,000 ; some of them are not taken up. If a person comes to you and offers you security, and it is good security, you must be in a position to say you will advance him money. If subsequently he gets better terms, or the mortgagee lets him have the money on better terms than the Go- vernment, then the object sought has been achieved. We do not cry because a person gets his money on better terms outside than from the department ; we do not ery because he does not take the money from us ; but we must be in a position to lend it to him. That is the object of the Bill. If you have no money at your command you will not have applications. If it is understood that we are limited to a million, and up to the 31st March could borrow no more money, people would never come near us. They would say, " What is the use of going to the Advances to Settlers have all your machinery, but people would not come, because we should have no money. It is the same as a banking or other financial in- stitution : the more power you have behind you and the stronger your finance the more applica- tions you will have and the stronger you will be. We started this by publishing to the world that Parliament had authorised us to raise three millions ; we now desire to show intend- ing borrowers and those who have already borrowed that we have got power to raise two millions, and that the only limitation in connection with it is that we should not be able to borrow more than a million during any one year. That is very simple ; if we did not get power by this Bill to raise two millions we should have to pass a Loan Bill again next year for another million-we shall have to pass a Bill this year for a million and another next year for a million. Why, then, should we make two bites of a cherry ? It is exactly on the same principle ; there is no reason in it at all. I hope I have made it clear. I say, unless you give this extended power, that our present powers will be exhausted by the end of the financial year. Then you have to go on till Parliament meets again, and there is another quarter of a million gone. I do not think it is desirable to come to the House, as some members would suggest, or to limit the Bill to a million, when, as I have said before, your million will be exhausted prior to the session of 1908. And this brings me to a point as to limiting the time. You should leave it open to the Government to selcet the best time for floating the loan. It may just happen-by holding on and not going on to the market for your loan-that your sum, being limited, would almost be exhausted, and. with your demands coming in, you would be forced to go on to the market and bor- row on terms which would be against you as compared with watching for the best market. The honourable member for Bruce was illogical in his argument. He said you are borrowing now, and you pay 4 per cent., whilst the basis of your borrowing and the construction of your finance is on a 3-per-cent. basis. He is right so far. Why, then, in the next breath does ho say, "I am going to limit you as to the time when you are to borrow"? He apparently wants to force us to borrow when money is at 4 per cent., knowing as he does that the basis of the Advances to Settlers Office loans was 3 per cent. You must leave the discretion as to the exact time to borrow to the Government, and that is one reason why we say there should be no limit, except that we should not raise more than a million in one year. Let the Gic- vernment use their discretion as to a faveurable time to borrow within the million limit. I think, after reflection, the honourable member for Bruce will see such a discretion should be given, and that the time should not be limited as under the present Act. I hope I have made things clear to the honourable member for Waitemata. He wants to know whether this money raised under the Advances to Settlers 
<page:224>
is, No; and it can and will only be used to lend to settlers, and it will not strengthen my general finance in the slightest. My finance for public works depends on itself, and a Bill will be brought down asking for a further loan for aid to public works this session. Mr. MASSEY .- Another Loan Bill ? Mr. SEDDON .- Yes, another Loan Bill. My honourable friend and others have forced it upon me. Mr. MASSEY .-. I did not force this on you. Mr. SEDDON .- No; but you like it all the same, and you will not vote against it either. So far as I know, the settlers in your district have benefited very much by it. At all events, in answer to the honourable member for Waite- mata, whether it is intended to be used as a means of improving my finance in regard to public works, I say it will not affect it. The money will be raised, if we can get it, at 3 per cent. ; it will be raised to the best advantage and when the market is most favourable, and I ask the House, under these circumstances, to leave this discretion with the Government. Having dealt with the financial part of the Bill, there may be some who will ask when the de- partment is going to round the corner. The an- swer to that is very simple. Last year there was a profit of about $2,200; at present there is about £20,000 to the good, and that is there practically as an insurance fund. And I must say that in respect to our advances we have been very fortunate. I made an exclama- tion when my worthy colleague was speaking  this morning, asking members to be somewhat merciful- An Hon. MEMBER .- " Charitable." Mr. SEDDON .- That was only a little slip of the tongue. That is not wanted at all in respect to this department. It is on the whole a well-conducted department, and investments made are very safe, so that there is nothing to be found fault with in that respect. The honourable member for the Bay of Plenty is very good at ferreting, and he thought he had done something when he had ferreted out that matter of the £1.000. and he thought the world ought to know more about it. Probably it might be a slip of my memory, but I really thought the House knew all about it. It so happened that a clerk to a barrister who was conducting the business of the Advances to Settlers Department embezzled the $1.000 while he was in course of conveying it from the department to the people who were borrowing it. The barrister and solicitor was responsible, and he has ac- cepted his responsibility, and, to his credit, he is doing his best to pay it off by half-yearly in- stalments. We therefore had to show on one side the deficiency and on the other side the credit. I think, under all the circumstances, we must sympathize with the barrister : and, as far as the department is concerned, they have shown it as a business transaction, and, with this explanation, I hope there will be nothing further said about that £1,000. Then, some- thing has been said in respect to charging Mr. Seddon ought to be free and not required to be paid for by borrowers. I do not see that that is possible. There must be in this department at all times, where you have almost week by week sales of land and transactions in land taking place, a live spirit in respect to its business, and the valuations must be care- fully watched during the whole time. Now, that phase of the business -- the valuation por- tion - is really the most important part of the department, because, as a lending institution, unless you are careful in watching your values, on the one hand you will make mistakes in not lending, and on the other hand you will make mistakes in advancing too much. You may, unless you watch carefully, make the mistake of refusing advances, and thereby doing an in- justice to probable borrowers. It is absolutely necessary, therefore, that these valuations shall go on. Now, when you contrast the position in respect to such advances and the different amounts chargeable thereon before this system became the law, with the expenses now-taking even the amount paid for valuation before as compared with what people have to pay now when borrowing from the Government-I say the contrast is greatly to the advantage of the settlers who are borrowing under this Bill. An Hon. MEMBER .- NO. Mr. SEDDON .- I undertake to say that any person who takes what the charges were for- merly and compares them with what they are now under this department will find that they are reduced by more than 20 per cent. But outside that there is the fact of its having brought the outside fees down-the charges of outside persons-and therefore it has been an advantage to the settlers. I also wish to deny the statement that has been made that there has been an advance in the valuations, and that that has gone on the rate-book. I say that is not so. I say the larger value is not placed on the rate-book. The Valuation Act especially states that the valuation returns for loans are not to be used for rates, taxes- An Hon MEMBER .- They are. Mr. SEDDON .- Then, according to your law as you have laid it down the valuations are not to be used for taxes or rates. There is your answer, and you must accept it, because you yourself have enacted that it shall not be so. And I suppose that you do not want the head of the department to shut his eyes and to lend your money blindly. If so, I think if you asked him to do so he would not be ready to please you. Mr. HOGG .- They are honest valuations. made by the same valuer. Mr. SEDDON. - I have been asked once or twice to allow the valuations for the Government and for the local bodies to be made conjointly, but we could not possibly agree to that. The result is now that in some districts there are over-valuations and in other dis. tricts under-valuations, and where the valua- tion is for State purposes, and there is a responsible head to the department, and that department is an important one-it would 
<page:225>
responsible. If you were to rely on outside valuers, and it was found that you had over- lent, who would be to blame ? Would it be said that the wrong persons had been appointed, and that the wrong valuations had been made ? No ; it would all come on the Government and against the department, and I say that, as re- gards valuations, the responsibility must be with the department, and, having taken their own valuations, the responsibility in respect to the advances also must be on the department, and you cannot introduce the three-year assessment element into it at all. If any attempt is made in that direction I would say that you are weak- ening the structure, and you are causing a risk which should not be run. The fact demon- strated by one and all the speeches here to-day is that at the present time, in round numbers, approximately, of the three millions we were authorised to borrow there is somewhere about $250,000 left. An Hon. MEMBER .- Where is the balance ? Mr. SEDDON .- Members ought to know that in connection with a Financial State- ment you must have a certain amount of liquid security when you are borrowing and lending out daily. I say that this money is in a liquid state, and there was £560,000 avail- able on the 31st March. We have gone on lending on the basis of half a million a year ; about $250,000 has been authorised since the 31st March last, and another quarter of a million will be gone by the 31st March, 1902 : and therefore if you do not get this Bill through we cannot after that go on lending. So that the matter depends entirely on repay- ments ; and I think the House will admit that it had better give us power to borrow the two millions at once, rather than that we should have to come again next session to borrow another million, and then have another debate, while the people are not sure if the policy is going to be continued. I say to the House that, although you are giving us these two millions, you would not raise more than one million a year ; but in doing so you are showing to the world that you are going to continue this policy, and the people who want to borrow will know that the money is there for the next year, and for the year follow- ing ; and I say if we cannot look that far ahead, then I am sorry for members and for myself too, more especially in a matter like this, where the Government cannot transgress. We do not want the money for any other purpose. It is intended purely for the purposes I have alluded to. I will further say this : that in the opinion of some honourable members we have been somewhat tardy in the advances we have made, taking half a million as our estimate for the year. It ought to have struck, and has struck, honourable members, I think, very forcibly, from the number of rejected appli- cations, that we have been very careful in our advances. It has been urged against us more than anything else that we have been too careful-that there ought to have been more advances. That is one of the strongest argu- VOL. CXVII .- 14. things that have been urged to-day. Mr. HALL. - Nine hundred applications re- fused. Mr. SEDDON .- " Nine hundred applications refused." Well, of course, it would be unsound finance to be lavish, more particularly when you are raising your money under a disadvan- tage, as you must under existing conditions. That is not the time lavishly to lend out your money. It is inadvisable, I say, to do that. At the same time, even with that disadvantage, we have kept to the policy of lending out reason- ably, and there has been no sound or sufficient security that has been refused. Another reason that may be stated is that during the last two or three months, owing to the increased rate of interest outside, there has been a rush on the office. People, when their mortgages fell in, were asked by the mortgagees for a higher rate of interest, because higher rates of interest have been ruling outside, and they, of course, naturally then rushed to the Advances to Settlers Department. Mr. TANNER .- They do not rush much out of it. Mr. SEDDON .- Well, that state of rush shows you, of course, that every precaution and care have been taken. At the same time I believe we can go with perfect safety beyond half a million a year. At all events, members can well trust the Government with respect to this matter, and in asking what we are doing now we are not asking for anything unreason- able. If I had brought in a Bill for a million, as some members think, I should positively have to come to Parliament next year for another million. The time for operating on the London market is from January to March, and it may be next January or March-say, twelve months from that time is the time you want to raise your money. If I was not empowered to do it-if I should be contined to the one million-I might have to raise it at a disadvantage owing to the state of the money-market, and it is therefore to the advan- tage of the department to have the power that we are now asking you to give us. It gives facilities for raising the money advantageously, and I am in no way injuring our credit. It will not, in my opinion, affect the credit of the colony. In fact, I believe it will help it, by showing that we have limited our advances for the next two years to a million a year, and to that extent I believe it will have an effect quite different from what some honourable members think. We can fix definitely what we intend to raise, and we fix it at the rate of a million a year. I think, with the explanations that have been given, and with the fullest con- trol, even the honourable member for Waite- mata may have confidence that I do not want to help my public works money. I think, with that explanation, the Bill ought to be passed unanimously. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton) .- I think it would have facilitated the passing of the Bill if the right honourable gentleman, who has just now made the real speech for the second 
<page:226>
what he proposes to do with the money while waiting investment. That, Sir, I think is the crur of the whole position. Mr. SEDDON .- If you do not raise it, how is it going to be available for investment ? Mr. G. W. RUSSELL. - The honourable gentleman has taken power in this Bill to raise $2,000,000, and he limits himself to the raising of $1,000,000 in each financial year. When the House meets next year we may find that the $2,000,000 have been raised. He would be able to raise one million during this financial year, and raise the second million before the House again met-that is, between the close of the financial year and the meeting of Parliament. The question is whether he or the Hon. the Minister in charge of the Bill, will explain to the House what form of investment the Go- vernment proposes to adopt in connection with that money while it is waiting investment. Now, I have listened very carefully to the dis- cussion that has taken place on the Bill so far, and I wish to point out to honourable members as nearly as I can what is the exact position at the present time. If honourable members will look at page 4 of the Advances to Settlers Re- port, B .- 13, they will see that under the 3-per- cent. loan (A) $1,500,000 has been raised, and under the 3-per-cent. loan (B) $500,000 has been raised, making $2,000,000; and then the next line is "Temporary advances, $380,000." Now, I cannot understand why $380,000 are called "temporary advances " in that table An Hon. MEMBER. - They are not.  Mr. G. W. RUSSELL. - Will the honourable gentleman allow me to say that this statement of assets and liabilities on page 4 of the Advances to Settlers Office report says distinctly, " Tem- porary advances, ₺380,000"? Now, the Public Accounts, as published in the Gazette No. 48 of this year, 16th May, says, under the heading of the "Government Advances to Settlers Office Loan Account" : "3-per-cent. stock created, 9240,000, and temporary advances on the security of short-dated debentures, £140,000." The posi- tion, therefore, is that the $210,000 has become part and parcel of the permanent loan, and that only £140,000 remains as temporary advances. Now, what is the position at the present time ? Allowing, as I have shown, that the moneys actually raised under the principal Act amount to €2,240,000, we get the Premier's $760,000, being the amount unexpended as at the 31st March. And allowing that he has $760,000 as at the 31st March unexpended, during the cur- rent financial year he will certainly receive nothing less than $175,000 from mortgages and instalments repaid. During the year end- ing the 31st March, 1900, he received $136,000 from this source ; during the year that has just expired he received $155,000 ; and, estimating that there will be €20,000 more than that sum during the present year coming in to the Advances to Settlers Department, I estimate for this year €175,000. Adding that amount then to the $760,000 remaining of the three- million loan, we have a total of $935.000 available, less $140,000 temporary advances, Mr. G. W. Russell temporary advances are repaid there will re- main in the hands of the Treasurer as between the 31st March of this year and the 31st March of next year the sum of $795,000 available for the purposes of the Advances to Settlers Depart- ment. That being the position, what, I would ask, can be the reason that the honourable gentleman, with that available cash balance for operations during the financial year, desires at the present time to force the House thus com- paratively early in the session into sanctioning a loan of $2,000,000 for the purposes of that department in addition to what he already has? I venture to say, and I say it without hesitation, that an answer to that question has not been given in either of the Ministerial speeches that have been made on this Bill up to the present time. Now, in connection with the balance. sheet that is before the House, I desire to draw the attention of honourable members to one or two points. In the second paragraph of this report it is stated : "The instalments of in- terest and principal to the 31st March, 1900, have been collected in full, no sum remaining outstanding on the 31st March, 1901." Now, can honourable members believe that in any great department like this, on any particular day, it was able to wind up its accounts so absolutely that there was not one penny owing for interest or instalments ? An Hon. MEMBER .- That was for the previous year. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- I admit that. And yet, Sir, we find that overdue interest is said in the statement of assets to represent no less a sum than $4,734 6s. 7d. Now, I come to another point. The Premier drew attention to the fact that the sum of $70,000 was in hand in connection with the Insurance Fund. That is quite correct ; but, Sir, the honourable gentleman omitted to notice here that there are $143,928 loan-flotation charges that have still to be brought up, and he also omitted to notice the fact that during the past year, not- withstanding that the operations of the depart- ment in the way of borrowing money have not been very large, the loan-flotation charges again come to nearly $10,000. I only wish to say that, in view of what I have stated. I think, if the Government are invested by the House with power to borrow $1,000,000 in addition to what they hold in hand, the effect will be to give them a thoroughly assured finance so far as the next financial year is concerned and the probable necessities of borrowers. There is no chance of people coming to ask for money and not being able to obtain it. I shall therefore support any motion that may be made for the purpose of reducing the amount that is borrowable under this Bill to the sum of one million of money. I would like to say before I sit down that I do not in the slightest degree share in the pessimistic views of the honourable member for Waitemata. I cannot understand that honourable gentleman, while members of his own party are recognising the great value this department has been to the colony in lowering the rates of interest, and in giving

cannot understand that honourable gentleman saying, as he did to-day, that the Government in bringing in this great measure were attack- ing private interests, and doing that which was not proper, right, just, or equitable. My own opinion is that this scheme has been of enor- mous benefit to that class of the community who especially needed it; and I think, after the tribute by the honourable member for the Bay of Plenty, Mr. Herries, to the success of the scheme in the way of benefiting the settlers of the colony, the honourable member for Waitemata was certainly ill-advised in making the long-standing and repeated attack he did to-day, and which members of the House have been accustomed to from. him on this question year after year. Mr. LAURENSON (Lyttelton) .- I will not detain the House at any length. I only want to draw the attention of the Minister in charge to one thing, and that thing is this: I should like to see a larger sum allowed by law to be advanced to people in village settlements. At present the maximum is a sum of $50, and one can understand that when a person builds a house for $50, with perhaps $30 or $40 of his own added, he cannot have much decency or comfort in a house costing $80 or $90. I have had that represented to me from quarters that I think can hardly be questioned, and my atten- tion has been drawn to reports from the Go- vernment officers, which speak of substantial dwellinghouses valued at $30-a substantial dwellinghouse valued at $30, for a man, his wife, and family ! I think the Government ought to introduce a provision which would enable a larger advance than $50 to be made upon a dwellinghouse. I think, too, that the time has now come when the people of the towns as well as those of the country should derive some benefit from the Advances to Settlers Act. I think it ought not only to be advances to the settlers in the country, but advances to the people of the whole country ; and, when the Government can get sufficient security and get a surplus from the working of the department, it means no loss to the State and incalculable benefit to the people. The people would benefit greatly by the extension of the provisions of this measure. I heard the remarks-what the honourable member for Riccarton calls " the pessimistic remarks "-of the honourable member for Waitemata. Well, I think all we need say is that the honour- able gentleman can hardly help himself, "'tis his nature to." He looks at things from a Jeremiah's standpoint, and he thinks that everything is going to the dogs, that every- thing is black and dreary and bad, while all the time we can see progress and advancement everywhere. I think surely we can trust the Government. Mr. MONK .- I want to trust Nature, and the people. Mr. LAURENSON .- Sir, the honourable member for Waitemata wishes us to trust Nature; but he is too true a student of nature and too deep a thinker not to we should have nothing to eat-that what we have to do is to help nature, and that if we did not we should soon relapse into barbarism. It is those people who trust altogether to nature who go down in life, and, that being so, I trust the honour- able member for Waitemata will rouse him- self, and realise that we are progressing in these days. Allusion has been made to the rate of interest. The most reputable writers on political economy point out that as science and machinery are at the present time, the rate of interest is bound to go down, because, after all, capital does not consist so much of money as of the products of human skill and human labour. I have not the slightest doubt but that within the next ten years we will see money ad- vanced in this colony at 3 per cent. I do not think that is at all an exaggerated estimate. At the present moment we know there is a tightness in the money-market, but any one who reads and studies knows the cause of that. The cause is simply this : The English Govern- ment have put on the market during the past twelve months bonds for some hundred million pounds. That has caused the tightness in the money-market ; but as invention progresses money is sure to come down, and within twelve months, unless a big war intervenes, 1 have no doubt the Government will be able to raise the money at a reasonable price. I cannot sit down without, like other members of the House, ex- pressing my satisfaction at the very able manner in which this department is administered. I know there is a good deal of dissatisfaction some- times at loans being refused, and the member for Waitemata has pointed out that the Govern- ment have refused advances of money upon good security upon which afterwards a larger sum was advanced. Now, the Government have a very difficult path to walk on. If. on the one hand, they advance money recklessly, no one would condemn them more furiously than the member for Waitemata ; and, on the other hand, if they are chary about making advances they are apt to get into very ill-favour with the people who want the advances made to them. What I say is this : if they err on any side, let them err on the side of caution. I can only express my satisfaction with the department ; but at the same time I trust that the Minister in charge will see his way to have this alteration made : that a larger advance may be given to the people in the village settlements, and that the Cabinet will take into consideration the advisa- bility of introducing a clause which will enable the Government, under certain provisions and safeguards, to make advances to the people in the towns as well as to the people in the country. Mr. ELL (Christchurch City) .- Last session I stated that so long as I was in this House I would seize every available opportunity of bringing under the notice of honourable mem- bers the danger that is looming up in constantly piling upon the shoulders of the taxpayers in- terest charges. I was surprised to hear the Premier deprecate the time that had been taken up by honourable members in discuss- 
<page:228>
ing a proposal to give authority for the raising of $2,000,000. One would think we were talk- ing of 2d., or some such trivial amount, to suggest that we were wasting the time taken up by discussing a proposal to give the Execu- tive power to raise $2,000,000. We are paying out now about one-third of our total revenue in interest on our public debt. Then, Sir, we have on top of that the private indebtedness ; and it seems to me that the members of this Legisla- ture. the representatives of the people, seeing that there is such an enormous amount of money being paid out of the pockets of the taxpayers as interest-charges to foreign bond- holders, it is therefore quite time to seriously consider and see whether we cannot devise some means of reducing the charges upon the taxpayers of the colony-whether we cannot devise some means whereby we may provide credit - which is absolutely necessary if we are to progress at all-to put into the hands of the people of the country in order to develop the resources of the country. An Hon. MEMBER .- State note issue. Mr. ELL. - The honourable gentleman is perfectly right. We have examples with regard to that that should remove any feelings of ner- vousness on our part from taking any steps in that direction. Only last session, I would remind honourable members, the Premier, in speaking on the Consols Bill, suggested that the time was not far distant when it might be desirable in the interests of the country to take some such step, and he also referred in somewhat  similar terms in reply to a question put to him by the honourable member for Dunedin City (Mr. Barclay). The honourable member for Waitemata, in speaking on the question of a paper currency, said that the people would not accept it, and that they only would accept when they knew there was gold behind it. If the honourable gentleman will take the banking returns published in the Gazette every quarter he will find this : that in the five banks trad- ing in the colony the interest-bearing deposits amount to €8,186,350 -- I am not quoting from the last quarter, but the preceding quarter ; the deposits not bearing interest amount to £6,925,369 ; and the Government deposits amount to $770,503- a total of nearly sixteen millions; while the notes in circulation of the five banks amount to less than $1.400,000. The coined money amounts to $2,752,000, and the bullion to $133,000. Now, taking the notes and the coined money and bullion, we only have four millions and a quarter of currency : yet, according to the banks, we have sixteen millions of cash deposits. In the Post-Office Savings-Bank we have over five millions. They are cash deposits, just the same as they are in the other banks, so that there are twenty-one millions of deposits between the five banks and the Post-Office Savings-Bank, and we only have a little over three millions of coin in the country. Where is the gold behind it ? The fact of the matter is that the gold, the copper, and the silver is a trifling part of the currency of the country. The currency of the country is manufactured credit, manufactured by the ! Mr. Ell banks, and that, Sir, is what we are paying interest on. It is not because the people know there is gold behind it that they ac- cept it, but because they have confidence in the currency. The banks could not possibly meet all the demands if they were made on them. The honourable gentleman contends practically that you must have sold behind your notes or otherwise they are not worth any- thing. Sir, we have had a lot of talk about the bale of paper and the printing-press : and every man who is opposed to a State bank, or the State having greater control of the currency than now, raises that bogey to frighten nervous people that they are going to be ruined if you give the State authority-to have absolute authority-over the currency of the country, and power to manufacture credit the same as the banks do. An Hon. MEMBER. - The Government made the Bank of New Zealand notes good tender. Mr. ELL .- Where would the bank have been if the State had not come to the rescue? The question of this advances to settlers and the currency are very much involved. You cannot separate the one from the other, and therefore I do not make any apology for touching upon this question this afternoon. We have bad statements made here this afternoon to the effect that the advancing of credit for that is practically what it is to the farmers to enal le them to develop their resources, to enable them to produce all that is possible to be produced from the rich lands of this country, has done a large amount of good. Sir, they are simply following the advice and plans advanced many years ago. Pennsylvania was in a somewhat similar position. They were without credit to enable them to develop the rich lands of their country. They had everything but the where- withal to make the most out of what they had. Benjamin Franklin then advised the people that they should create credit. They did, and they issued thirty-five issues of paper-money in that State, and the system extended for fifty years. They charged 5 per cent. for the credit that was thus loaned out. Then, as the interest came in they called the notes in and destroyed them, and that operated very successfully. When the British Government took away the right of issuing notes from the States it was represented to the British Go- vernment that it had been carried on with such success and with such care that the Govern- mont allowed the State of Pennsylvania to re- tain this privilege, and subsequent events showed that the authorities were quite justified in taking the step they did take in creating credit, because success follows upon the issue of credit to the people, as it enables them to develop their resources. Now, we have another in- stance given by MeLeod, who is one of the recognised authorities on banking. MeLeod stated that agriculture was impeded, that the development of the resources of Scotland was impeded, because they did not give credit to the farmers. The farmers had not the cash ; and what was their device ? They sent down boxes of notes to the different branches of their banks 
<page:229>
in the different agricultural centres of Scotland, which were lent out to the farmers at a small rate of interest. An Hon. MEMBER .- Was there good secu- rity ? Mr. ELL .- Yes. They only advanced on good security, and 50 per cent. was the value up to which they advanced ; and a very good safe- guard it was, as it enabled them to carry on with safety and success. It had a most wonder- ful effect in developing the resources of Scot- land. They manufactured the credit, and they charged interest on the credit they manufac- tured. We borrow money from people in the Old Country, and we pay them interest for the credit they have manufactured, extracting it from our surplus. Now, if the banks can safely manufacture credit, cannot the State do it ? say the State can, and we have abundant evi- dence of it in one country. We want the State to establish a State bank, and that State bank should create credit as the bankers do. And as to what the honourable member for Waitemata says about there being nothing tangible behind it. supposing a merchant in a grocery business sells five hundred pounds' worth of goods. He takes a bill from his customer. He lodges this biil in the bank, and he has the cash credit up to $500. But before that bill matures where are the goods? Consumed. They have all gone. There is no tangible security behind that. The good name and the confidence in which the merchant is held by the banker is the authority that the banker has for advancing the cash. That is how credit is created -- piled up in huge bills in the banks. Then, if a local body wants a $5,000 advance it goes to the banker. What does the banker do? He has to be satisfied that proper steps are taken to secure the bank the payment of interest, and the local authority is absolutely credited with .€5,000, and the bank issues to the local authority a cheque-book, and the local authority proceeds to draw upon the amount credited to it. Prior to 1844 nearly all the money that was created was created by the issue of bank-notes. After 1844 the bankers devised another plan. They do not now issue notes for every $10,000 of credit, but simply make a book-entry of that amount and supply the customer with a cheque-book, who draws on his credit of $10,000 at the bank as he re- quires it by cheques. That is how it is multi- plied-by means of cheques and by means of bills. Nearly the whole of the commercial transactions in this country are carried on by the creation of credit, and not by the notes, and the gold, and the coin. You could not do it. It is absolutely impossible. I simply mention this to show that you do not want a bale of printing-paper, and you do not You merely want to want a printing-press. Vest in the authorities of this country the power of manufacturing credit in the same way as the banks do. Then, I do not think we should have the cases we have now of local authorities paying 6 or 7 per cent. for an over- draft of €5,000 or $6,000. Why should not a local authority be able to go to the State bank, and the State bank create the credit? We were told by the Premier a few evenings ago that the result of the year's operations of the Bank of New Zealand has been most successful, and that an amount of over $300,000 had been made during the last year. That shows very well that the power of manufacturing credit- which is the means that the banks have of making money-should be given to the State, and that the State should have the pronts which are now going into the pockets of the bankers. We have an accumulation of reserve profits held by the banks amounting to three millions and a quarter of money, and the amount paid in dividends by the five banks, according to the returns just issued, amounts to $242,500. So you see the power there is under our present system given to the bankers to make enormous sums of money out of I the people every year ; and it occurs to me, Sir, that it would be a statesman- like act on the part of any Premier to tackle this question of the growth of 4.0. interest and see if something cannot be done to reduce it. I just wish to make one or two remarks in regard to the proposal to borrow this money. If anything could remove from the minds of members any feeling of uneasiness as regards this department, about trusting the Executive of this House with the power of raising a loan of two millions, it should be the complaints that have reached this Chamber, not only last year but many times this session, that the Government are too careful. I have not heard a case yet where they have been reckless. That is a very good point. It is far better to be careful than reck- less, and this should remove all feeling of un- easiness with regard to giving the Executive authority to raise the money. While it is true that money can be borrowed as cheaply as from the department, I do not think it can be ques- tioned that the Government having these ad- vances to settlers in operation is a distinct check on the rate of interest ; it keeps the rate down. It is quite true you can borrow as cheaply as from the Government, but the very existence of the department has a very whole- some effect, and helps to keep down the rate to a reasonable amount. I shall support the Bill. Mr. HOGG (Masterton) .- The honourable member for Christchurch City has given us a very good address on the science of banking, borrowing, and finance generally. But while I was listening to his remarks, which are of a distinctly controversial character, I was re- minded of an old fairy story about a king, a miller's daughter, and a wizard, who went by the name of Rumpelstiltskin. The king wanted money, as sovereigns frequently do. He came to the miller's daughter, who was at her spin- ning-wheel, and asked her to take some straw and convert it into gold. The miller's daughter, in fear of pains and penalties if she did not per- form the wonderful work required of her, began to be very down-hearted ; but a little elf made his appearance and helped her to spin this straw, and golden coins rolled from her spinning-wheel. Apparently, from what we have heard from the honourable member for Christchurch City, the 
<page:230>
settlers of New Zealand resemble the king, the Advances to Settlers Office is the miller's daughter, and Rumpelstiltskin is the honour- able member (Mr. Ell), who intends to show us how to manufacture money at will. No doubt, if his sanguine anticipations can be realised, he has made a splendid discovery. We have been told that sunbeams may be made out of cucum- bers, and in these days of science and enlighten- ment some very wonderful developments occur, but I doubt whether capital can be manufac- tured by the easy process suggested. But, leav- ing this abstract question altogether aside, I should like to say a word or two for the honour- able member for Waitemata, who has been at- tacked by some members in the House this afternoon. I rather admire the honourable gentleman ; if he is characterized by one pecu- liarity more than another it is that he has the courage of his opinions. There is no more valiant man in the House. He says exactly what he thinks. When I listened to him I was reminded of the old Scotchman who went to church and heard the clergyman constantly denouncing the enemy of mankind, till at last his heart melted, and, turning round, he said, " Let's say a guid word for the puir auld deil.' The honourable gentleman has been saving a good word for that man of large private enter- prise, poor old Shylock. Sir, the honourable gentleman shakes his head, but I am certain if no other man in the House or in the country would put in an ingenious apology for poor old Shylock that he is prepared to do so. He  has been telling us that we are interfering with private enterprise. There is not a re- form you can establish that does not tread on the corns of this ingredient called private enterprise. We are constantly disturbing it. I have no doubt the honourable gentleman must be horrified at the fact that the private money-lender is going to the wall. We only have to go a step further and take the advice of the honourable member for Christchurch City (Mr. Ell), and we will be able to grow our own money in the same way as we grow our corn and wool and dairy produce. It is out of this that money is made. Our produce is the source of our wealth, and there is no part of the world where wealth can be more easily grown than in New Zealand. It does seem an anomaly to go abroad for our money. But has not the Gio- vernment recently been floating a loan in New Zealand ? They floated it most successfully. They have shown there is plenty of money in the country ; and, if money can be obtained easily at 4 per cent., surely it is the duty of the Govern- ment to keep their departmental money-lender - the Advances to Settlers Office-in easy cir- cumstances. If we raise money within New Zea- land at 4 per cent. and lend it to the settlers at a slight advance, are we not assisting those who wish to invest money ? They could not have better security than that of the State, and the Government can make good use of their money by advancing it to the men in the back blocks and Crown tenants who require it. Mr. HORNSBY .- But they do not. Mr. HOGG .- My honourable friend the mem- Mr. Hogg | ber for Wairarapa says they do not. I sympa- thize very much with him, but at the same time I recognise that the Government Advances to Settlers Office must exercise caution. The Act has been doing extremely useful work. It is doing more to help the prosperity and progress of the colony than anything else that has been attempted in past times. If our settlers had to depend on the private money-lender, do you think we should find the huge amount of work and the advance of colonisation that is going on in the bush districts? What hap- pened yesterday at the Wellington Land Board, of which I am a member? There were no fewer than about sixty applications to mortgage Crown leaseholds, and of these-Iam only speak- ing from memory - about fifty were applica- tions to mortgage to the Advances to Settlers Office. This is about double the business of the kind in one month that has yet been done by this office. I am pleased to see it. The present is the season when the settlers have to carry out bushfelling and spend a good deal of money in improvements. I am pleased to see the business of the office growing so rapidly, because it indicates conclusively that the country settlers are displaying plenty of energy and enterprise. In the face of facts like these, and seeing that the Crown tenants are taking such advantage of the office as they are doing, I consider it is our duty to see that the office is well supplied with capital. I am sure that that is the feeling of members on both sides of the House. I was very pleased to hear the remarks made by the member for the Bay of Plenty, who has plenty of settlers in his district requiring the assistance of capital. He knows they are getting that assistance to a very large extent through the medium of the Advances to Settlers Depart- ment. This department has been the means of keeping down the rate of interest and building up the country for years past. It is quite immaterial whether the office advances half a million a year or one million. It is doing a useful work in keeping the rate of interest within fair and reasonable bounds. The ques- tion of valuation having been raised, I would like to suggest to the Minister in charge of this department that it would be a very great im- provement on the present system if settlers who pay to have valuations made were supplied with the particulars of those valua- tions in every case, whether the loan applied for is advanced to them or not. There seems no reason why they should not be sup- plied with the information, and it would be a source of great satisfaction. If their applica- tions are refused, they should be supplied with the value that is placed upon their property. As it now happens, they are left entirely in the dark. They may meet with a refusal, or be told that they can have a reduced amount : but they do not know what valuation has been placed on their improvements. Having paid a fee to get the valuation made, they ought to be supplied with the information. I can assure the Minister that it would give a great amount of satisfaction to settlers generally, and it would also be a matter of justice to the valuers con- 
<page:231>
nected with the office if that information were regularly supplied. There is another thing that I think the Government might take into con- sideration, and that is whether the funds at the disposal of the Public Trustee and the Govern- ment Life Insurance Department should not be distributed through the medium of one office. We have several Government departments ad- vancing money, and I think it is most desirable, for various reasons, that the moncy should be advanced by one office, instead of having several lending departments. One department or one Board should do the whole of the work. It would be much more efficiently done than through the medium of several Boards belonging to different departments. I would like to see the whole of the lending departments grouped together, and the Advances to Settlers Department intrusted It would with the whole of these funds. . strengthen that office and prevent Govern- ment departments competing in the money- lending business. I merely point out certain suggestions that have occurred to me. They seem valuable. I intend to support this Bill, for the reason that I believe the Advances to Settlers Office is doing a wonderfully fine work for the colony, and that it ought to be well supported with plenty of money in order to help the settlers in their efforts. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) .- Sir, in spite of the speeches which have been made in support of this measure, some of them much beside the question, like that of the member who has just sat down, I do not think the Government are justified in introducing this Bill, for the reason admitted by the Minister in charge of the department-and by the Premier himself- that there was available on the 31st March last for the purposes of the Advances to Settlers Department something like three-quarters of a. million of money. We are lending at the present time at the rate of about $500,000 a year in the Advances to Settlers Department, and that will probably decrease as the repay- ments increase. All the time money is coming in, and consequently it is reasonable to suppose that the money which is in hand and available at the present time ought to be sufficient to last for the next two years. Such being the case, Sir, I do not think the Government are justitied in proposing to borrow two mil- lions for this purpose this session. Then, there is not a word in the Bill to show how it is proposed to raise the money - whether it is intended to raise the money in the colony or on the London money-market. And here I feel strongly, just as strongly as the honourable member for Christchurch City (Mr. Ell), that there are two purposes in connection with the government of the country for which we ought not to go outside the colony to borrow. One is the Land for Settlements Department and the other is the Advances to Settlers Department. I feel strongly, Sir, that, as far as the Advances to Settlers Department is concerned, we ought to utilise the lending departments of the Go- vernment. Of course, two of them already lend money on mortgage-the Government Insur- ance Department and the Public Trust Office ; but I think we ought also to utilise the Postal Department-that we ought to use the moneys of the Post-Office Savings-Bank for the purpose of lending either directly to the settlers of the colony or indirectly through the Advances to Settlers Department. I think it would be better for the colony as a whole, and it would certainly be very much better for the depositors in the Post-Office Savings-Bank, which has lent very large sums of money to the Government at 3 per cent. net. If they lent it to the settlers on mortgage I believe they would be able to get a higher rate of interest than the rate they re- ceive at the present time, and the benefit would be mutual. But I feel strongly, in spite of what has been said to the contrary, that this money it not being raised for the purposes of the Advances to Settlers Department. I am inclined to think that the Government intend to take advantage of the Act of 1895, which allows the moneys of this department to be in- vested in the securities of the colony, and that probably we shall find later on that the money which it is now proposed to borrow will be used, perhaps, for public works, or for land for settle- ments, or for some other purpose. I want to tell the Premier that I am quite willing to sup- port a loan straight out for the purpose of carrying on public works-I am willing to sup- port such a loan-but I am not willing to raise a loan for such a purpose in the roundabout manner that this Bill proposes. Another point that I wish to find fault with is this : that we are not supplied with sufficient information in the report of the department. Honourable members, I think, will remember that two years ago we amended the Act in the direction of allowing the department to lend on urban and suburban properties as well as on country lands. Now, there is nothing in the report to show what proportion of the capital is lent on such properties. I want to tell the Minister that there are ugly rumours about some of the urban properties on which advances have been made, and I hope the Minister, in the interests of the colony, will give some information to this House about those properties. I do not think anything has been said about two very We are peculiar statements in the report. told in one place that "The instalments of interest and principal to the 31st March, 1900, have been collected in full, no sum remaining outstanding on the 31st March, 1901." In another place the accounts show that there was interest overdue on the 31st March, 1901, to the amount of £4,734 6s. 7d. I am willing to admit that that is only a very small sum in proportion to the amount of business being done, but I have heard over and over again- and I have reason to believe it-that what the department is doing is this : that where the settler gets behind in his interest the interest is capitalised and added to the mortgage, and the mortgagor has to pay not only the interest on the money borrowed, but also on the back interest as well. I hope the Minister is paying attention, because I wished particularly to bring this matter before his notice. That is about al! I wished to say. I am as anxious as any one 
<page:232>
else that the settlers of this colony should have the benefit of cheap money, because I know how hard a matter it is for them to compete, as they have to compete, with other countries which are nearer to the great markets of the world than we are; and if I thought it was absolutely necessary that we should borrow for the purposes of the Advances to Settlers Act I would support the measure, but, in so far as it has been shown that the department has sufficient money to last for a long time to come, I intend to oppose the Bill. Mr. J. W. THOMSON (Clutha) .- About an hour ago I thought the debate was coming to a close, but it seems to have taken a new lease of life, and I think I also might say a word or two. The honourable member for Masterton began his speech by speaking in very kindly terms re- garding my friend here, the honourable mem- ber for Waitemata. I thought he would follow on in the same strain and bring out the many good qualities of the honourable member, but in this I was mistaken, for he went on to com- pare the honourable member for Waitemata to a very unworthy personage, of whom only Scotchmen like myself and the honourable member for Masterton have heard. The per- son who first introduced a Bill of this kind into Parliament was the late Mr. Macandrew. This was in the session of 1886. I voted for the second reading of Mr. Macandrew's Bill, but our present Premier, who was then a mem- ber of the House, voted against it. I mention this simply to show that I am not opposed to the policy of the Bill, but I think there is no occa- sion for the Bill at present. To show this I would simply require to repeat figures that have been referred to by a good many members. The report of Mr. McGowan shows that during   the last six years the average of money lent has been $446,000 per annum. The sum lent during the last year was about $500,000. It also appears from what the Premier has said that there is a balance available of something like three-quarters of a million. With these figures before us, I think the Government are in a position to carry on without borrowing for the next twelve months. That is the reason why I shall vote against the second reading of the Bill. Captain RUSSELL (Hawke's Bay) .- Sir, the debate on this Bill has been so thoroughly ex- haustive that it seems almost ridiculous to point out anything further in connection with the passage of this Bill. I shall venture only to offer a few remarks, therefore, and they have been called for to a certain extent by the remarks of the honourable member for Christ- church City (Mr. Ell), who evidently is not afraid of the bogey that he alluded to-the printing- press and the bale of paper. Sir, I will come back to that presently. With regard to the precise amount of money which is available for the advances to settlers, it seems to me that no honourable member agrees with any other as to the actual amount of money that is available. As for the Minister who introduced the Bill, may I not venture to compliment him on his cou- rage in taking charge of his own Bill, notwith- Mr. Massey standing that it was almost in the hands of his leader. I think it does him infinite credit that he has the audacity -I will say the courage -to speak to the Bill when his overpowering leader wished to take it from his hands. The honour- able member would have followed a course more consistent with his dignity had he followed a similar course more often, and I venture to say we should get the business through more ex- peditiously and be more likely to curtail the length of the session if Ministers took charge of the Bills connected with their own departments than by the Premier attempting to force every- thing down our throats. Mr. SEDDON. - I took exception to my worthy colleague asking members opposite to be charitable ; there was no reason for so doing. Captain RUSSELL .- Well, I did not take any exception to the word "charitable," which was used by the Minister. I recognise that it just slipped from his tongue, and that he did not mean it, but that the whole administration has been a great success. But I am quite in agree- ment with those honourable members who say that there can be no necessity for borrowing so large a sum as two millions of money at the present time. There is a sum of $760,000, as mentioned by the honourable member in intro- ducing the Bill, or $600,000 odd, as mentioned by others-nobody agreeing as to what is the exact sum available -- but, taking the figures set forth in B .- 13, it would appear that there was $620,000 of the original $3,000,000 still unlent on the 31st March last I may be told that in the very first page of this paper, where we are told that "The instalments of interest and principal to the 31st March, 1900, have been collected in full, no sum remaining outstanding on the 31st March, 1901," there is sufficient inaccuracy to throw doubt on all the subsequent figures, and to show the divergences in the honourable gentlemen's figures from those of the return. They show that the interest re- ceivable and overdue is $4,734 6s. 7d. I hope the Minister, when be comes to reply to the speeches which have been made in connection with this Bill, will explain the difference be- tween the statement, almost in the first lines of the report presented to the House, and the figures contained in the statement of liabilities and assets. Although I do not attach any great importance to the deficiency, it is a considerable sum to be in arrears, for the amount, in round numbers, is a little over 5 per cent. of the amount collected. And as the next line shows the interest receivable and accrued at $22,084 93. 2d., in all proba- bility of all that interest which is properly shown as assets a good deal may be in the form of interest in arrears on the due date. But there was, at any rate, taking the figures in the paper which is laid before us, a sum of $620,000 available for investment on the 31st March last. It may be argued, if the figures are reliable, there was $620,00 ) available on the 31st March, to which you may add. taking the reclamations of last year at $155,000 -one may fairly argue, at any rate, that there will be an increase on that amount this year of $20,000. I find that 
<page:233>
the reclamations in 1809 were £104,473; in 1900, $136,532 ; and last year, $155,000. There- fore it is only reasonable to suppose there will be a still further increase this year, and there is every reason to believe there will be, with prin- cipal, and sums for reinvestment, $795,000 available between the 31st March, 1901, and the 31st March, 1902. And as I find by looking at the figures of the various reports and the various papers which have been laid on the table that the advances on mortgage were only $539,220 last year, that they were $445,955 the year before, and $281,540 the year before that, it is reasonable to believe that the amount which will be required for advances tins year will exceed by a very small sum the amount of $600,000. Therefore we have an ample sum in hand, along with the reclamations which are coming in and any further pay ments that may be made. The Premier told us it was necessary the power should be in hand so that it may be possible to borrow it at any expedient time. But I find, under the 32nd section of the original Act of 1894, that no debenture can be sold at a price that shall yield more than 4 per cent. to the buyer. But there comes in the clause, sub- 4.30. sequently to that restriction, which gives the Government the power to borrow at any rate they may choose to pay. Under that provision I think we are likely to run into great dangsr. The words are, " Such debentures or other securities may, for the pur- poses of temporary advances, be hypothecated or mortgaged upon such terms as to interest as the said agents may deem expedient." Sir, under that part of section 32 the Government have ample power to borrow at any rate of interest they may think fit. And there is where the danger comes in. Whereas under the first part of the clause the Government is limited to the rate at which they may borrow, under the latter there is no limit whatsoever. Well, every person who has taken the trouble to look at the prices current in the money-markets of Europe, and realises what rate of interest the present price of Consols yields, must understand that it is practically impossible for New Zealand to borrow in the English money-market at the present moment. The result must be inevitably that the two millions, which, as the honourable member for Riccarton pointed out, may be borrowed on and before the 2nd April next year, will be money borrowed on short-dated debentures from financial institutions in this colony, at such rates as the Colonial Trea- surer chooses to pay. That is an extremely dangerous position in which to place our- selves. There is no immediate prospect of the money-market - I mean the English money- market - improving, and so the loan cannot be advantageously floated in London, and there- fore the power we are asked to grant of borrow- ing two millions of money must have, and I conscientiously believe has, some other object than advancing money to settlers. The amount, as so many honourable members have pointed out, that is available at the present time, from the original loans and from sums repaid to the Treasury in the shape of interest and in the reduction of mortgages, is such that there can be no absolute necessity for borrowing any money within the current year, unless there is some other object for its employment than the mere lending of it to settlers. Well, in this clause you will see there is power for the Go- vernment to borrow at any rate they think fit. And I may say I think we ought not to give them power to borrow so large a sum as two millions, even though it was shown there was urgent necessity for some money ; and no Minister has yet shown that there is a neces- sity for any at all. Then, with regard to the advantages of State credit, I understood the honourable member for Christchurch City to speak as though there was no instance of harm happening owing to the issue of a paper currency by a State. 1 ask him, does he remember the history of the great French revolution, and what became the value of the assignats? Does he remember - Mr. LAURENSON .- Under what circum. stances were they issued ? Captain RUSSELL .- Quite so ; but that does not affect the question. What was the honour- able member's argument? It was that if the credit of the State was pledged it was immaterial whether there was any gold at the back of the credit-that the issue by the State itself was sufficient to make paper-money valuable. Well, I quote as an instance that of the assignats, which became absolutely valueless, though issued by the State of France. Then, I would quote the instance of the Confederate bonds at the end of the war of secession in America. Mr. LAURENSON .- Two instances of war. Captain RUSSELL .- The honourable mem- ber must not forget that it is possible that our credit may hereafter be injured by war or byother causes, and that more powerful States than New Zealand have had their credit vanish and their paper currency become absolutely value- less; and what has happened to others may happen to us. The honourable gentleman then spoke of the extreme success of the issue of the State of Pennsylvania bonds. I had an idea that I had read something about their not being a very great success ; but I will quote two instances, one from a book on the history of the United States by J. M. Ludlow, a writer on historical subjects, a man who well knows what he writes about, and not merely an irresponsible trifler, but in reality a man who has carefully studied history, and therefore may be taken as more or less an authority upon what he writes. He speaks of the action of various Presidents and people in connection with State debts, and continues here : - " After Biddle's attempt to create in Eng- land a famine of cotton, the President still declared (2nd December, 1839) that the American banking system subjected the country 'to the money-power of Great Britain.' 'The want which presses upon a large portion of the people of the States,' he said, 'is an enormous debt, foreign and domestic. The foreign debt of our states, Corporations, and men of business, can scarcely be less than 200,000,000 dollars." " 
<page:234>
This, it must be remembered, was in America, and in 1840 America was certainly as powerful and had more inexhaustible resources than New Zealand has at the present time. The debt was 200,000,000 dollars, which, reduced to pounds, is much the same as New Zealand's is now, and yet it was the cause of embarrassment and of temporary ruin to that great continent. Now, I would ask the special attention of the honourable member for Christchurch City (Mr. Ell) to the condition of his much-vaunted State of Pennsylvania, which was the special instance quoted by the honourable gentleman in favour of the financial policy of the bale of paper and the printing-press to create prosperity :- " In his message of the next year (5th Decem- ber, 1840), he reverted to the subject, dwelling on the heavy debts of the States, on which more than 12,000,000 dollars annually went to the subjects of the European Governments. And, although he had previously (1839) urged that 'the faith of the States, Corporations, and individuals already pledged be kept with punctilious regard,' yet in dwelling on the burthen of the debt, in urging its extinction, he must evidently, to many of his more un- scrupulous hearers, have seemed to suggest or sanction those short cuts to this end (in the shape of ' repudiation ') which were taken about this time, or a little later, by too many of the States (wealthy Pennsylvania herself suspending payments)." And the passage continues,- " The guilt, indeed, being equally shared by the North and the South, free-soil Michigan giving hands to slave-soil Mississippi, destined one day to give a President to a southern   confederacy. Repudiation in Mississippi, with which the name of Mr. Jefferson Davis is disgracefully connected, dates from 1837." Now, where is the soundness of the argument of the honourable gentleman that it is specially desirable that New Zealand should imitate the financial polies of the State of Pennsylvania ? That is the serious view of the question. Let us examine a lighter treatment of the same subject. There is an extremely amusing book which I have no doubt most honourable mem- bers have read. It is called "Bon Gaul- tier's Ballads," and in that book there is a wonderful description of a fight in America, "The Fight with the Snapping Turtle." The meaning of the metaphor I have no intention of stopping to unravel. The snapping turtle was a monster af great malevolence that lived " In the dreary Swindle Swamp," which " Philip Slings- by, Slingsby of the manly chest," was peculiarly anxious to kill. But before entering into com- bat he was anxious as to his chances of re- muneration. This is how he entered into nego- tiations for payment :- Listen now, sagaceons Tyler, Whom the loafers all obey ; What reward will Congress give me If I take this pest away ? Then sagacious Tyler answered, " You're the ring tailed squealer! Less Than a hundred heavy do lars Won't be offered you, I guess ! Captain Russell " And a lot of wooden nutmegs In the bargain. too, we'll throw, Only you just fix the critter ; Won't you liquor ere you go ?" And then there is a long account of the fight with the snapping turtle, and Philip Slingsby does as he promised, succeeds in killing the monster, and then comes back for his payment. How was he paid ? I have no doubt the honour- able member for Christchurch City is familiar with the ballads and with the history of the fight in which Philip Slingsby killed the turtle. He will recollect that when it comes to the question of payment Slingsby says,- Post the tin, sagacieus Tyler ! But the old experienced file, Le .ring first at Clay and Webster, Answered with a quiet smile- "Since you dragged the 'tarnal critter From the bottom of the ponds. Here's the hundred dollars due you, All in Pennsylvanian bonds !" And at the bottom of the ballad is a little wood- cut showing " the only good American securi- ties " in those days was a pair of stocks and a chain. I fear the honourable gentleman may think I am flippant. I have no desire to ap- pear so, but have quoted a serious passage and a comical passage, and both of them go to show that with the printing-press and bale of paper the State of Pennsylvania was remarkable not for its solvency, but for its failure. Mr. ELL .- The honourable member for Hawke's Bay has taken one illustration to try and kill mine. What I stated was this: that the Government of Pennsylvania had created credit. Captain RUSSELL .- I am sorry to interrupt the honourable gentleman, but I must rise to a point of order. As a personal explanation, of course we would be glad to hear him if I have misrepresented him, but surely he cannot make a new speech on Pennsylvanian bonds. Mr. ELL .- The honourable member for Hawke's Bay was referring to my utterances about a bale of paper and a printing-press, and my illustration was this : that the Government of Pennsylvania had created credit, and ad- vanced that credit to the farmers on good security. The honourable member for Hawke's Bay quoted to show that the Government of the United States issued State money and that that was depreciated. I admit that. My illus- tration was simply to show the power of the State to create credit, and to let that credit out at a low rate of interest. Mr. MEREDITH (Ashley) .- I exceedingly regret that so little interest is being taken in a question of so vast importance as that. before the House at the present time. A ques- tion of the voting of two millions of money is a very important one, and I think if members only realised the position fully we should have a large attendance of members on the floor of the House, and a deeper interest taken in the question submitted for our consideration. I have always supported the Government ad- vances to settlers, and I shall continue to do so. In looking through the report of the Government Advances to Settlers Office for the 
<page:235>
year ending the 31st March, 1901, I find a great deal of valuable information. I notice that the total amount advanced from the inception of the scheme up to the 31st March last was $2,626,785. Out of that, $495,684 has been refunded, and there remains outstanding on mortgage securities £2,131,100. The Govern- ment have power to raise for advances to settlers the sum of $3,000,000. This £3,000,000 has been operated upon so far to the extent of 92,000,000, and there are temporary advances of $380,000, so that the total amounts raised up to date are less than the amounts authorised under existing legislation by, according to the figures of the Hon. the Premier, which figures were corroborated by the honourable mem- ber for Riccarton, the sum of $760,000. In addition to $760,000, which is still to be operated on, the member for Riccarton antici- pates that there will be from refunds available during the present year #175,000 at least, making a total of $935,000; and providing out of that for temporary advances and short-dated bills to the extent of £140,000, there is still available for the Government to operate on an amount of $795,000. That is a large sum of money. An Hon. MEMBER .-- It is not there. Mr. MEREDITH .- The honourable gentle- man says " The money is not there ; " but the Premier says it is there. Now, under the exist- ing authority the Government has power to operate to the extent of $795,000. The amount advanced last year was £539,220. This was in excess of the previous year by £90,000, which was in excess of the previous year by £257,678. What do these figures show? They disclose this fact: that there is an casing-off in the   applications for advances. The advances last year show that the amount advanced, though in excess of the sum advanced the previous year, was nothing like the excess of advances that the year 1900 was over the preceding year. Taking into consideration that the Go- vernment still have $795,000 to operate upon, there is no necessity whatever to bring in this loan of $2,000,000 this session. The honour- able gentleman who introduced this Bill has not made out a good case in favour of the Bill, inasmuch as there was advanced in the year ending the 31st March, 1901, a little over half a million of money ; and surely if there is $795,000 still to operate upon there is suffi- cient there to provide advances for the next eighteen months, so that if we authorise a million of money under this Bill instead of two millions that would enable the Government to carry on the advances to settlers for the next three years or longer. At any rate, it is per- fectly safe for two years. An Hon MEMBER .- There is no money for it. Mr. MEREDITH .-- Yes ; you could continue to lend money as you have lent it for two or three years under the Advances to Settlers Act. I cannot for the life of me see any justification for introducing this Bill. The Advances to Settlers Department is in a flourishing con- dition. It has been remarkably well managed, no losses have been sustained, and it has been of wonderful assistance to the farming industry and the settlers of the colony generally. I cannot see any necessity for introducing this Bill during the present session of Parliament. The money-market at the present time is in a depressed condition, and we do not know what is to eventuate. I think we ought to hesitate before we commit the colony to further loans and thus jeopardize our credit at the present time. As I have already said, I cannot see any justiti- cation whatever. I know that the Government Advances to Settlers Department has been the means of lowering the rate of interest in this colony. There can be no denying that fact ; but at the present time, while the Government Advances to Settlers Department are clearing at the rate of 44 per cent., there are private individuals who are now negotiating mortgages at 41 and 4% per cent .; and before I left Christ- church I was told by a legal gentleman, with whom I was conversing on the question of the money-market, that there is a gentleman in Christchurch who has a large sum of money to his credit in the banks in that city who is pre- pared to advance moneys on good securities at 41 per cent. I believe if the Government could lower the rate of interest to something like 4} or 4 per cent. there would be a larger de- mand for mor cy from the Advances to Settlers Department. I am of the opinion that, con- sidering the condition of the money-market at the present time in New Zealand-we know that colonists have been realising on their estates and that money is accumulating in the banks of the colony-there will be no rush on this. department for loans during the next few years. Then, again, it has been pointed out that. instead of going to the money-market and raising the proposed loan of two millions sterling, why should we not avail ourselves of the accumulations to credit in the Insurance Department and in the Savings-bank Depart- ment. That would be a proper course to take. However, I shall be prepared to vote for reduc- ing this amount from two millions to one million. I consider one million abundance to enable the Government to operate on. If there was any real necessity for more, it should have been pointed out by the honourable member who is in charge of the Bill, or by the Premier, who spoke in support of the measure ; but so far no valid reasons have been brought forward by the Government to show that it is necessary in the interests of the Advances to Settlers Department to raise the sum of two millions. Mr. FLATMAN (Geraldine). - Sir, the honour- able member for Ashley thinks it would be an easy matter to utilise the Government Savings- bank money for the purpose of making advances under the Government Advances to Settlers Act, but I think if the honourable gentleman considers the position for a moment he will see that, as some of it may have to be tied up for thirty-six years, it would be a dangerous pre- cedent to interfere with money which has to be kept practically in a liquid condition. Sir, I thought the honourable gentleman was more of a farmers' friend than he has proved himself to be by his speech to-day. I find that he pro- fesses to wish the farmers success, and at the 
<page:236>
of this Bill by arguing that by raising the sum of #1,000,000 the demands of our settlers for money will be met for some time to come. I can scarcely follow the honourable gentleman's argument. There is no doubt the Advances to Settlers Department cannot be in a healthy state unless it has money at the back of it. If the people know there are no funds available they will not apply for loans required, and con- sequently the office suffers. Some members have said there is a falling-off in the number of applications for loans from the department. Well, Sir, that may be so or it may not, but if such is the case I do not think it is in conse- quence of a high rate of interest charged by the office. I have been told by those who borrow from the Advances to Settlers Department that they feel in a greaterstate of security than they do under the system of borrowing from private individuals with whom they have to renew their mortgages every three or five years. Under the terms of the Advances to Settlers Department they get their money and may retain it for thirty-six years, and the interest together with a 1-per-cent. sinking fund will repay the prin- cipal at the end of that time. Then, the mem- ber for Ashley advocated that the Government should lower the rate of interest, while in the same breath he said there was a tightness of money in the Home market. He is actually asking the Government to do impossibilities. You might as well try to make the round peg fit the square hole as try to do such a thing as he suggests. However, what I chiefly want to draw the attention of the honourable gentleman in charge of the Bill to is that, according to a table in the annual report (B .- 13) which has been handed to members this year, it appears that, while the sum of $2,721,695 has been au- thorised for advances on freehold securities, leaseholders have had only $439,785 authorised to them. I am given to understand, Sir, that, although leaseholders offer more than the se- curity the Act demands, they are often refused advances, although the district valuer may have recommended the loan. I do not see why they should not be given due consideration, at any rate to the extent to which they are able to give security. The Bill was really introduced with the object of relieving the small farmer, and I trust, Sir, that the Government will keep that object steadily in view, and give these people justice. I do not say they have not had justice. I am only showing, by a comparison of figures, the amounts authorised for loans to the two classes, and stating what has been told me about the matter. If any injustice is being done to them I hope the Minister will look into it and see that as long as a leaseholder offers fair security his needs will be attended to. Members on the Opposition benches speak as if they were in favour of assisting the farmers in every possible way, yet at the same time they are talking against this Bill. Sir, we know from the tone of their speeches they are opposed to the measure, just as they opposed the first Bill of the kind that was introduced. Sir, I cannot understand what objection they can Mr. Flatman success, and that it has done good, and that those whose requirements are satisfied under the Act are the ones who are paying the interest on the money raised under the Act. Then, some members say that the Government should not have the authority to raise two millions when one million would meet all requirements for some time to come. That is simply a Com- mittee objection, and the sum can be reduced when the Bill reaches that stage if the House sees fit to do so. When the first Bill was passed three millions were authorised, the whole of which the Government might have raised in far less time than they did; and if that loan has been treated in an honest, straightforward, and statesmanlike way, I would ask the House why the Government should not be trusted again to raise a further loan ? I do not think that even our friends on the Opposition side can say there was anything corrupt, dishonest, or unstates- manlike in dealing with the three-million loan ; and, consequently, I conclude that there is no reason now why we should not trust the Go- vernment to raise a further loan, which the department state is required, and which is shown to honourable members by figures that have been laid before us, that the money will be required in the near future; and, that being so, I trust the Bill will meet with hearty support. I think that, when the question is put, even those members who have spoken against the measure will not vote against it; in fact, I doubt if there will be a division called for on the second reading. I myself have 5.0. every confidence that the money will be treated with all due care, and therefore I shall have much pleasure in supporting the second reading of the Bill. Mr. WITHEFORD (Auckland City). -. Sir, the redeeming feature of the Bill is that its ob- ject is to encourage an important industry of the colony ; though I should have been more pleased, or shall be more pleased, when a motion comes before this House to reduce the public debt of the colony by two millions, rather than to in- crease it. But under the circumstances of the case there is a difference. What I would like is that, instead of going to the English money- market, the Government should endeavour to raise the whole of the money in the colony and keep the interest in the country, even if we have to pay a little more for it. Regarding the question of gold reserves, I do not think it would be any use for the colony, in view of the experi- ences of America and other parts of the world, to endeavour to underestimate the value of these reserves. Now, I do not think, in regard to our goldfields and other great resources of the colony, that we are making the best of them at the present time. Many miners are leaving the Auckland goldfields at the present time on account of English capital being withdrawn. I do not think the Government ought to allow a single miner to leave our shores if that man can be retained by giving him work to help to develop our resources, and par- ticularly the gold-mining industry. It may seem to be an extreme way of dealing with 
<page:237>
the question, but I do not think the colony | would be the loser by employing experienced miners in the development of our mineral wealth ; and we could establish a New Zealand mint and coin our own sovereigns, because all the money which would have to be expended in producing gold would have to go in the neces- saries of life, all of which can be produced in the colony; and there is no better internal market for settlers' produce than a prosperous goldfield. Therefore to keep on perpetuating the system of going on the English money- market to borrow money and paying interest is, I think, a mistake, particularly when we have in the bowels of the earth here more gold than England, Scotland, and Ireland has. If there was that great wealth to be developed in those countries it would soon be unlocked by the strong arm of the working-man ; and in this country, particularly with a Government which is a labour Government, something should be done to produce gold, and no better avenue for labour could be created for those miners who are out of work than to put them on to extract gold from reefs that would be payable, in the richest known gold-mines, which are being abandoned for want of capital. Let us turn our Geological Department into practical ac- count, and let them go to work and thoroughly test some of these partially developed mines, and point out the best method of treating certain reefs, like as in the case of the Waihi Mine. I believe that for a long time the reefs in that mine were unpayable by the ordinary  process, and the mine was open for sale for $60. A young man named Russell experi- mented with it, and proved that by adopting a different treatment the ore would pay-just as the Geological Department should experi- ment upon other reefs, and find out, as he found out, the right way to treat the quartz- and the result is that that mine has turned out over a million and a half pounds' worth of gold in the last ten years. I mention that as an instance that we should apply our Geological Department to promote goldfield success ; and we should make the best use of the unemployed working-men within the colony, and produce more wealth than we do at the present time. I do not think there is any necessity to go to the English money-market for these loans. There are millions on deposit in the savings- banks and other institutions in the colony, and I do not think it is impossible to arrange that all future money for the Government should be raised in some shape or form in the colony, and so keep the interest in the colony instead of allowing this enormous stream of money to be sent out of the country every year. Mr. G. J. SMITH (Christchurch City) .- Sir, I do not think it would be for the good of the colony to raise this money within our own borders. I take it that the intention of the original Act was to introduce cheap money into New Zealand, and if the effect of the Govern- ment going to the Home market and raising money there has been to reduce the rate of interest, then it seems to me it would be absolute folly for the Government now to at- tempt to raise a two-million loan in the colony. The inevitable result would be that those who had to borrow money privately, outside the Government institutions, would have to pay a higher rate of interest for it. If the money is to be borrowed, the Government will take the right step by raising it at the lowest possible rate on the London market, and leaving avail- able the money in the colony to supply all needs outside the Government Advances to Settlers Office. Now, the honourable member for Auck- land City (Mr. Witheford), referred to the ad- visability of the Government going in for quartz- mining and gold-producing. Well, Sir, in one district in this colony I would like to tell the honourable gentleman that there is gold pro- duced at a cost of $5 per ounce, and it is only worth £3 14s. The honourable gentleman mentioned the Waihi Mine ; will he mention any other that has had a like career ? The Hartley and Riley Dredging Company of New Zealand has been phenomenal in its return ; but I say it is pure chance as to whether you strike good quartz or whether you get on to a good lead for dredging purposes. And for the honourable gentleman to suggest that the Go- vernment of New Zealand should go into quartz-mining, and take the risk of finding a rich deposit, it would be the maddest thing the Government had done for some considerable time. Now, Sir, so far as this Bill is con- cerned, it is in continuation of the principle laid down by the original Act ; and it appears to me that the only question for the House to consider is whether at the present juncture we require to raise an extra two millions or not. About #620,000 is available for this current year, and that plus the repayments that will come in will probably bring the amount up to £800,000. Now, if the regular advance goes on this year as it has done in the past, probably between $500,000 and ±600,000 of that amount will be taken up, and the result will be, if this sum of money is not raised this year, that the department will have to get its authority next year. Before the amount is raised several loans will have lapsed; and the consequence will be that the department will be embarrassed so far as its future operations are concerned. I confess that when this system was first brought down I had grave doubts as to whether the department would be such as to make the scheme prove successful. The scheme itself has proved successful, and it will be bad policy on the part of this House to embarrass the department by refusing to allow it to raise a certain amount of money. Sup- posing the amount of the loan is reduced, as suggested, by a million, that would give- if the Government raised that million, with the amount now available and the repayments that will come in-an average of $600,000 or $700,000 for three years; and I think that ought to be quite sufficient to satisfy the de- partment that the House is willing to treat it generously and to enable it to carry on its business operations. I do not know that it is necessary to go into the whole question of the Government Advances to Settlers Department. 
<page:238>
table of the House has proved conclusively that the department, as a department, is suc- cessful. Members of the House all round have generally conceded that point. There is only one clause in the report which refers to the amount of principal and interest out- standing on the 31st March, 1900, and it states that these have been settled and col- lected in full, and there is some slight mis- conception as to what that means. I read it that on the 31st March last all instalments owing on the 31st March, 1900, had been duly collected. The report is wisely silent on the amount outstanding for the present year, but we get that from the statement of liabilities and assets on the 31st March, 1901, where it is stated that the interest now overdue amounts to £4,734. The two statements are compatible one with the other ; but I think that the report itself would be a little more clear if in the second paragraph attention had been called to the fact that the only amount outstanding for the present year was £4,734. I do not think there is anything to hide so far as that amount is concerned. I say a department which has advanced the amount this department has, and collected its interest so far, has nothing to be ashamed of, if at the time of the annual balance there is only a sum of $4,734 out- standing. I shall support the second reading of the Bill, and it will be for the Minister in charge of the department to prove to the House, when in Committee, that the second million is absolutely necessary, and unless he can do that I shall vote in favour of reducing the loan men- tioned in the Bill by one million. I think if we make provision for three years for an average amount that ought to be quite sufficient so far as the amount is concerned. Mr. PARATA (Southern Maori) .- I should like to say a few words with regard to this Bill. It asks this House to authorise the borrowing of a further sum of $2,000,000 to be used by the Government Advances to Settlers Office for cash advances to settlers. Now, Sir, I want to see the Maoris participating in the benefits to be derived from this department. Maoris who hold titles to individual blocks of land should be allowed to participate in the benefits to be derived from the advances-to-settlers scheme : but up to the present it is only Europeans who have come from a distance and settled on the land who have been able to avail themselves of the benefits of the Act, while the Maoris are debarred therefrom. I have known applications to be made by the Maoris to the Advances to Settlers Office for money by people who are actually in possession of their own land, and were working it at the time of making their application ; they desired to get the money to improve their land ; and I would point out that if the Maoris are debarred from participating in the benefits of this Act they cannot possibly be expected to run in the same street as Europeans, and they will fall far short in the attainment of knowledge as to how their land should be worked. In many instances if the Natives got cheap money they would be Mr. G. J. Smith farming occupations. I very much desire to see the Minister in charge of the Bill insert a clause to provide that the provisions of this Act shall apply to Maori owners of land as well as Euro- pean. I think the Minister should give his most grave consideration to this question. The Maoris certainly should be allowed to borrow money from the department. Now. there are certain Maori lands at the present time occu- pied under lease by European settlers on the west coast of the Middle Island, at Mawhera, Hokitika, and Arahura, and at other places in the Grey district, and vet the Advances to Settlers Department will not lend money to those people to enable them to improve that land. At present that department will not ad- vance money to Maori landowners unless the lands on which they desire to borrow are leased to Europeans, so that the rent may be devoted to paying interest on the advance. 1 do say, Sir, that any Maori who honestly desires to make a home for himself and his wife and his family should be permitted to borrow money from this department. The Government, Sir, have competent valuers going about the country, who are personally familiar with the districts and know the individual occupiers and owners of the land, and it is for them to inform the department whether or no the applicants for advances should or should not have the money for which they ask. Again, I will ask the Minister in charge of the Bill to lend a careful ear to what I have said with regard to allowing the provisions of this Act to be taken advantage of by the Maori landowners, and I would sug. gest to the Minister in charge that he should submit a proposal of that kind to Cabinet. If the Government, as they profess, have really the welfare of the Maoris at heart, then this is a peculiarly suitable opportunity for them to show it by giving favourable consideration to my proposal. Sir, I should like to make one more remark. Certain members who have spoken have said that, in their opinion, a $2,000,000 additional loan is too much, and I agree with them. However, I do not propose to say a great deal about that. I have simply done what I considered it necessary to do: I have told the House what my views are in regard to the Bill. Mr. CARNCROSS (Taieri) .- Sir, seeing that this debate has been drawn out to such a length, five or ten minutes more talk will not make much difference, so I propose to say a few words. I am always interested when the subject of advances to settlers comes up for discussion, because it takes me back a long time -- before I had the honour of a seat in this House. Before I came into this House I strongly advocated from Press and platform that the Government should adopt the policy of borrowing money and advancing it to agri- culturists at low rates of interest. I quite well remember one of the financiers of Dunedin heckling me at a public meeting, and telling me that my ideas were merely those of a political tiro, and utterly impracticable. But time has brought about its revenges, and my 
<page:239>
self I may say, has since discovered to his cost that this practical and workable measure has been brought to a head by the Government, and has done an immense amount of good to the colony in general. I cannot help thinking of the strong opposition that was brought to bear whilst we were endeavouring to get this measure through the House. I should not have referred to this but for the fact that there has been an all- round discussion this afternoon, in which the principle of the whole thing has been entered into. There was very strong opposition to this measure in 1894. Where is that opposition now-I mean the Opposition arguments, not the individuals, although I might even include them ? The argument was that this was going to be a huge political engine of corruption, that it was an iniquitous scheme for simply one purpose: that the Government might have money to advance to people of the right " colour," and no one else was to get it. Well, that argument has been fairly well exploded by this time. Then, we were told also that not only was this money to be advanced to people of the right "colour " only, but there was to be a general laxity of administration, that the securities would not be properly looked into, and that huge losses would be entailed. Sir, that prediction also has been falsified, as every one of the predictions made concerning the evils that were likely to ensue from the passing of such a measure have been falsified by what has taken place since this-which is one of the finest measures we have ever placed on the statute-book - was passed. I consider this measure has done more good to the agricultural portions of the community than any other measure that has been passed by this Govern- ment. We have been told over and over again that this measure has had nothing whatever to do with reducing the rates of interest, that the rates of interest were naturally dropping, and that therefore it was no thanks to the Govern- ment for passing the measure. Sir, that is the veriest claptrap and nonsense, and is unworthy of credence. I know people who, when their loans came due, simply went to the money- lenders and said, "If we cannot get better terms from you we will go to the Government," and the money-lenders in each instance said, " We shall have to meet the Government in the money-lending field ; we must reduce our rates and fight them on their own ground." But, Sir, they have never been able to go quite so far as the Government : as, for instance, to accept $10, or even smaller, instalments by way of paying off the principal. This is the largest measure ever passed for the relief of the agricultural people of New Zealand. It has come to stay, and I shall not have the slightest compunction in supporting the Government in their proposal to borrow another two millions for this particular purpose. I know, of course, they will only get authority to the extent of one million per annum. I know there is a tendency at the present time for the rates of interest to rise, but I have sufficient faith in the capacity of the Ministry to know that they money on a rising market, that they will seize the proper opportunity for obtaining it, and, I have not the slightest doubt, at reasonable rates. Now, I think the honourable member for Bruce misled us to-day when he was dealing with this measure. He told us that he would, at all events, approach the subject charitably. Mr. J. ALLEN .- I was asked by the Minister to do so. Mr. CARNCROSS .- Possibly so; and you agreed to do it. Well, I admit the Opposition has been charitable to-day. But, Sir, it is the force of circumstances that has brought about this charitable mood. How much charity was shown when the measure was sought to be placed on the statute-book ? Just by way of curiosity I looked up the journals to-day to see how many members of the Opposition were influenced by charity when we were getting the measure through. I see that the "Ayes " in favour of the Bill were thirty-six. An Hon. MEMBER .- On the second reading ? Mr. CARNCROSS .- On the third reading, the crucial test as to whether you are in favour of the Bill or anything attaching to it. I find that only two members of the Opposition re- corded their votes in its favour-namely, the honourable member for Egmont (Mr. McGuire) and Mr. Wilson, who is not now in the House. And in those days I may say Mr. McGuire was not so closely allied to the other side of the House as he is at the present moment. An Hon. MEMBER .- Oh ! was he not. Mr. CARNCROSS .- If you turn up the early speeches of that honourable member you will find that no one spoke so strongly in favour of the policy of the Liberal Government as did the honourable gentleman himself. An Hon. MEMBER. - He gets wiser as he gets older. Mr. CARNCROSS .- Yes, he is wise in this respect : that you will not find him to-day op- posing this Bill ; and a good many of the Oppo- sition have grown wiser in that respect. But where, I think, the honouralle member for Bruce misled the House a little to-day was when he said that the working of the Act, was based upon money at 3 per cent. Mr. J. ALLEN .- I said the scheme was. Mr. CARNCROSS. - Yes, the scheme. Well, Sir, I think he is scarcely correct there. I take this to be the scheme upon which it was based : Turning to the original Act of 1894, you will find that clause 32 reads thus : - "No debenture or other security issued under this Part of this Act shall be sold or otherwise disposed of at a price which will yield to the purchaser thereof a higher rate of interest by the year than four pounds for every hundred pounds of the purchase-money." Sir, it is very plain that the general scheme of this Act was fixed on a 4-per-cent. basis. An Hon. MEMBER. -- What about Mr. Ward's speech at the time ? Mr. CARNCROSS .- I contend that I have nothing to do with the speeches at all. What I am bound by is the Act we passed. There i is the scheme, I take it. It is quite true that 
<page:240>
tions given in the House that it might be pos- sible to borrow for less than 4 per cent. The Hon. Mr. Larnach held that view very strongly. and when we went on the market it was found that the money was obtainable at a lower rate than 4 per cent. Sir, the whole basis of the thing was calculated upon the clause as laid down in this Act, and that clause authorised the Government to borrow money at 4 per cent. That we obtained the money cheaper was a fortunate circumstance. There were gentle- men on the other side who ridiculed the whole thing. It was utterly impossible, they said, to get it even at 4 per cent. ; and so their con- fusion was very great when the news was cabled out that the money had been obtained at 3 per cent. I think that is a fair reply to the honourable gentleman's argument that the whole basis of this Bill was framed upon a 3 - per - cent. scheme. Sir, I reiterate once more that I will support this Bill. It contains a principle that I regard with the greatest satisfaction. I look upon it as one of the best measures ever passed. In my know- ledge it has done an enormous amount of good to the agricultural community. Its scope has been further extended, and other people are now able to obtain money at a lower rate of interest. It has proved a considerable check on money- lenders, who, were it not for its existence, would never have advanced money at the rates at which people now obtain them. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) .- May I make a per- sonal explanation ? The honourable gentleman said I misrepresented the facts. I said the scheme was based on the money being secured at 3 per cent. My authority was the whole of the debate in 1894, and especially the speech of   the Minister-the Hon. Mr. Ward-who intro- duced the Bill. There can be no doubt he based the whole of his argument for the success of the scheme on the colony securing money at 3 per cent. It is true under the Act the amount the debentures should yield in interest to the pur- chaser is not to exceed 4 per cent. We place that in every Act; but that is not the amount we are supposed to borrow at. The honourable gentleman knows the Premier, in a Bill the other day, suggested 4} per cent. as the limit which purchasers should receive as interest, but the money would undoubtedly be secured at 34 or 4 per cent. Mr. WITHEFORD (Auckland City). 7.30. -I wish to make a personal explana- tion. In suggesting that miners should be em- ploved rather than allow them to leave the goldfields I was misunderstood by the honour- able member for Christchurch City (Mr. Smith). I did not propose to put men on unprofitable mines, but that pavable lines of reef now par- tially developed should be selected by the Geological Department. I said it would be better to put our miners to work on these reefs and develop the hidden treasures of the coun try than let the men leave the country, and I instanced the case of the Waihi Mine, where a young man went practically to work and by tests and assays found out the best method Hr. Carneross discovery upwards of two millions of gold has been extracted from that reef within the last ten or twelve years. This was an immense thing for the country. It was with a desire that the Geological Department should be put to the greatest use, and so help us to reap the greatest benefit from the miners and able- bodied men on the goldfields, that I suggested they should be put to work in the payable, not the unpayable, mines. The honourable member for Christchurch City Mr. Smith) quoted a district where gold to the value of $3 15s. cost £5 to obtain, but the result was different in Auckland, and, I believe, the West Coast, where figures in the past show that for every #1 spent more than a pounds' worth of gold has been obtained. When we consider that every sovereign taken out of the ground and put in circulation is created wealth, and there is no interest to pay on it, and that every sovereign passing from hand to hand leaves a little profit to each and is a blessing to every tradesman, we shall see that the more we take out of the ground the better ; and we do not need to go to England at all for gold, because there is more in this country than in the Old Country. Mr. HASELDEN (Patea) .- I should like to say a few words on this question of borrowing two millions of money to help the advances to settlers. I cannot see that two millions are required, when we have the word of the Premier that the average grant is only half a million. It seems it is to be used to fill up gaps, and not all applied to advances to settlers. A great deal has been said about the reduction in the price of money, but if we look at the thing fairly we shall find that the price of money had fallen before the three-million loan was autho- rised. When Sir Joseph -- then Mr. - Ward went to England, even with his great financial abilities and his persuasive tongue, he could not have persuaded the English money-lender to lend money at 3 per cent. if he could get 4 per cent. elsewhere. The fact was the price of money had fallen at the time not only in England, but all over the world. I believe the A.M.P. were then lending at 43 per cent. I do not consider this Advances to Settlers Act has been so unmixed a blessing as some people suppose. There has been considerable expense in obtaining the money, and I have a letter from a back block settler, who complains of the way in which he has been treated in the matter of a loan he applied for ; and I know of another instance where an expenditure of #11 was in- curred in valuation-fees before the applicant received a letter saying that the money could not be lent on the class of security he was offering. This man, of course, was not of the right "colour "; but his neighbour, living a few miles from him, who held his land exactly on the same tenure, applied for and got a loan for the amount he asked. I have no doubt there are two sides to every question, and there may be another aspect of this question ; but, so far as I know, the fact is as I have stated. I have received the following letter from a settler in the back blocks :- 
<page:241>
" We respectfully beg that you will air fol- lowing grievance before the House, re the way back-block settlers are treated from the Ad- vances to Settlers Office. I will only give you my case: I have 400 acres leasehold, of which 200 is felled and in grass, 45- or 50-chain wire fence, house and storeroom, yards, orchard, and garden. I got an advance of $75 three years ago, and I applied for $100 last January, and I have just got $75 - all I could get, 'or was offered,' after waiting six months. Now, don't you think I ought to get what I applied for, when you see what improvements I have got ? I will give you an example how it is valued : 45 chains of fencing, $45 ; house and store, insured for $50: 200 acres felled and grassed, including yards, orchard, gardens, and other improvements, should only be worth $205 : total, $300. Now, do you think this is fair valuation ? Ought I not to get what I applied for ? Mine is not the only case. Every one else in this block is the same. There is from 25 to 50 per cent. less offered, whether for a big or small amount. The valuer for this dis- triet, in my opinion, don't know the difference on 2 or 20 acres. He generally asks his way about. Now, I will show how the charges are made for executing the mortgage : For the first $75, #1 14s. 6d. ; valuation, 10s. 6d. = £2 5s. : and for the last $75-Execution of mort- gage, $2 9s. 6d. ; valuation, 10s. 6d. ; exchange of cheque, 2s. = $3 2s. Now, why should the last one cost 17s. more than the first one, when the mortgage is the same ? I should fancy it should be cheaper ; 17s. isn't much to some people, but it is a lot to a struggler up here. Now, I won't trespass upon your valuable time. If I had written to the department they would not take any notice of this, but I am sure you will let those who in power is hear of this." I have very little more to say upon the Advances to Settlers Act, except that I do not think it is working satisfactorily. I certainly object to the two-million loan which is asked for. I would not oppose a million loan, because the Act is on the statute-book, and it would cause a great deal of additional trouble to the settlers in the back blocks if they could not However, I shall obtain further advances. oppose a two-million loan. Mr. LANG (Waikato) .- I wish to explain my position in reference to this Bill. I think, with the last speaker, that the amount asked for is far too large. Judging from the speeches made by many members of this House, the Govern- ment have enough in hand to last considerably over one year ; but, so far as I am concerned, I am quite willing to support sufficient money being raised to carry them over one year, at any rate. I do not wish to cripple the Go- vernment or the department in any way, but I desire to point out that the money is far more urgently needed in other directions than in advances to settlers. I am speaking now purely from a settler's point of view. I maintain that if the two millions were expended in the opening-up of roads in the country, to give access to land that is being opened up by the Crown, it would be of far greater benefit te the VOL. CXVII .- 15. settlers than if expended under the Advances to Settlers Act. I have known of cases in which people have obtained loans under the Advances to Settlers Act who have been sorry afterwards, for they found that they could make better terms privately. They have been under the impression-and that is one thing I have been ready to admit until I found it to be to the contrary -- that they would be able to get the loan cheaper, as far as legal and other expenses are concerned, from the Go- vernment than from private lenders, but they have found that the expenses were quite as high, if not higher than if it had been obtained in the ordinary way. My only reason for rising is to express my views on this Bill, because I do not believe in supporting the second reading of a Bill simply in the hope that it may be altered in Committee. I believe we should vote for the Bill as we find it, while, when it goes into Committee, I hope the amount will be cut down in the way I have indicated. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston) .- I would like to say a word or two before the Minister replies. Personally, I have always supported the system of advances to settlers by a Government depart- ment, but I do think the Government are asking too much in asking us to support the borrowing of two millions at the present time. I do not think for a moment that the Government intend to borrow the money in the immediate future, because there can be no doubt that, at the rate the department is going at the present time, instead of the amount of advances increasing every year, there will be a less amount asked for. But it is the fact that, in asking for two millions in addition to other loans the Govern- ment will be asking for this session, we have heard from the Premier that he is contemplating another million loan for public works, and before the session goes over I suppose there will be something like four millions authorised to be borrowed. And, in addition to that, I believe the Government have authority from last year to borrow another two millions ; so that it really means that we shall be authorising this year the raising of loans for New Zealand to the amount of six millions. This means that if we attempt to float a loan on the London market-and I am not at all sure that we shall be able to do this-the people whom we ask to lend us the money will un- doubtedly be informed of the position New Zealand is in, and that we have to borrow something like six millions during this year in order to carry on our ordinary services. Under those circumstances, I am sorry the Government have not thought discretion the better part of valour in regard to these loans, and only asked for one million instead of for two. Several speakers have also alluded to the danger to property-owners in the colony of asking the Government for an advance under the Advances to Settlers Act, on the ground that their valuations for ordinary tax purposes are frequently raised in consequence of their very often unsuccessful applications. This was met by the Premier referring to the Act, which did not permit it ; but I was glad to see 
<page:242>
of this, and point out that the reason was that the same valuer was employed by the two de- partments. Undoubtedly it is so, and that is, to my mind, one of the worst features in the sys- tem-the placing of two departments, which ought to be separate and distinct, under one head. If they were separated, or if local bodies were allowed to make their own valuations, you would not find the machinery of the Ad- vances to Settlers Act used unfairly for the purpose of increasing the valuations upon pro- perties. Reference was also made to the charges of solicitors employed by the Government under the Advances to Settlers Act, and I will say- and I say it plainly-that it is an improper thing for any person employed by the Govern- ment in this capacity to be a member of Parlia- ment. No matter where he gets the remunera- tion from, his appointment is practically a matter in the hands of the Government, and it means that he is really in Government employ, and it seems to me to be an improper thing that any member should owe a position of pecuniary advantage in this respect to the Government. We have been told that some of those who are engaged by the Government as solicitors for the Advances to Settlers Department charge far more to their clients than the rates fixed by the Act. Unfortunately, there has been good reason to believe that sometimes that is the case. It is said that the charge is made in a way which entirely evades the Act, and I would like to ask the Minister if it is not possible to devise some amendment that would prevent that being done.  I am told as much as $20 is charged for search- ing a title by solicitors who are engaged under the Advances to Settlers Department, and it will be easily seen how it is possible to mount up costs in this way, so as to make it almost prohibitive to the man who wants to borrow money from the Government. I think the only charges that should be allowed are those laid down under the Act; and if any further charges are to be incurred they should come under the review of the department, and not be a matter between the department's solicitor and the intending borrower. I think the Act has proved undoubtedly a very great benefit to the settlers of the colony, and if it is wisely administered, as it has been in the past, I have no doubt we will never have cause to regret having instituted this department of the State. Mr. MILLS (Commissioner of Trade and Customs). - Sir, when I was introducing the Bill we are now discussing to the House this morning, I used the expression "charitable construction " in my speech, and the Premier, who was in a playful mood, suddenly inter- rupted me, and it was quite evident that his objection could only have been raised because he did not hear the words with which I in- tended to conclude the sentence and that por- tion of my remarks. I would not have alluded to it again but that the honourable member for Bruce, in a bantering tone, endeavoured to make out afterwards and wished to construe a mean- ing from it which, if left unchallenged, might Mr. Pirani ferent from that which I intended. We know that some people claim the privilege of speak- ing twice, while others are allowed to speak until they are understood. When I used the remark referred to 1 contend it was perfectly right. I was alluding at that time not to the department, but to some of the younger valuers who had been engaged at an early stage of the work by the department, and I said, if it was true there had been any errors committed by them, we ought to place a charitable construc- tion on their action, because I was perfectly sure it was done with quite an innocent inten- tion. What is the meaning of "charitable"? Johnson's Dictionary says it means " kind, favourable, indulgent, generous," and last, but not least, " liberal." Surely under that inter- pretation there is no harm in such a phrase as " charitable construction." To pass now to the remarks of the honourable member for Bruce, Mr. James Allen, the first thing he had the audacity to state was this- An Hon. MEMBER .- Oh ! Mr. MILLS .- Well, Sir, it was audacious for the honourable gentleman to say in effect that the business of this Advances to Settlers Department was decreasing. Why, Sir, a Fourth Standard boy would draw a different conclusion after reading the printed balance-sheet and reports, which are in members' pigeon-holes ; and, after his making a statement of that kind I could not allow it to pass unchallenged. In fact, the honourable member for Masterton has already partially saved me the trouble of making a statement in contradiction, because he has shown us that there were no less than sixty mortgages from Crown tenants passed through the Land Board and sanctioned by them only yesterday or the day before, and out of these they were all, with the exception of nine, from the Advances to Settlers Office. Therefore that is direct and sufficient evidence of what our settlers and the Crown tenants think of this great policy measure. Why. Sir, I know not of one, but of hundreds of settlers in this colony who have been relieved from a miserable existence by this great policy measure being placed on the statute-book, since it gave them a chance of recovering from that hideous burden of from 10 to 15 per cent. interest they had laboured under for years. And, Sir, I state. as a fact, the interest in the colony had not lowered before Sir Joseph Ward went Home ; and I could, with very little trouble, put my hand upon letters and show this House where those engaged in money-lending in the colony stated that unless the scheme was successful there was no question that higher rates of in- terest must prevail, and that very soon. I think it was well understood by the general public that such was the case. The honourable mem- ber for Bruce went on to say something about the figures in the balance-sheet not being correct for the 31st March. If he recollects aright, he will remember that I explained all about these matters, and quoted some figures up to date. We all know that certain mortgages are paid in as they mature, and thus amounts 
<page:243>
those mortgages, while new ones are issued, and therefore the balance must vary, and always will do so, monthly. But if I did not clearly explain the position with regard to the I claim to have figures let me do so now. done so before, but I spoke more on the broad facts of the measure; and when I have a com- plate report such as I hold in my hand-a report which honourable members should read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest-it is not too much to ask them to look at the details. At any rate, I will give the figures once more, and, of course, honourable gentlemen will realise that I am speaking not from my own book, but from the books of the Valuer-General-the Superintendent of the Advances to Settlers. According to this statement, we had a balance of $760.000 of the old loan that we could raise by way of debentures or otherwise. Against that sum $200,000 has to be set as temporary advances already obtained. An Hon. MEMBER .- It is only £140,000 ac- cording to the published accounts. Mr. MILLS .- Well, I shall be able to ex- plain to the honourable member for Riccar- ton, Mr. G. W. Russell, where his figures are wrong, as they generally are when he criticizes audited balance-sheets. The figures I have re- ceived are, in my opinion, from an undoubted source, and therefore I give them with the weight of that authority to the House. Now. then, there would be only $560,000 available for the coming vear ; and any one can under- stand at once that, if the office is putting through a sum of something like $500,000 an- nually by way of investment, there could only be available under any possibility a sum of .€60,000 at the 31st March next year. An Hon. MEMBER. - How about repayments ? Mr. MILLS .- Repayments are falling in, but the business is also steadily increasing, and therefore the department is surely not to be tied down to a paltry sum of $60,000 for its working balance in an immense business of this class. Sir, honourable members begin to talk about millions in such a casual way as if these vast sums of money meant nothing. Is there any lending business in this colony whose in- vestments amount to a fifth part of the busi- ness of the Advances to Settlers Department ? Every one knows that there is not. But the office itself has grown up so steadily that it is only now and again members in this House realise the importance and magnitude of the advances made, and have anything to say in regard to it. It would never do to tie this office down to only a paltry sum of $60,000 in credit. Really, Sir, I am astonished, because honourable members, one and all, have said, either by way of forcible discussion or by im- plication, that they believed in this great policy ; and if so, if they mean what they say, why not do the best that can be done and keep it moving in the way that it should go? Why should we not carry out the wishes of the people who sent us here? Of course, I know, and every one else in this House knows, that for some years past the Government has had the authority to raise They had the power to borrow £3,000,000 under statute ; but did they not show a wise discre- tion when raising that money, and only make a move to raise it when the time was opportune ? I say they did. They have guided this busi- ness, and they have done what they thought was best in the interests of the colony as good sound business-men ; because, after all, it is a business office, not a sentimental office, and one that is conducted on fair and reasonable business lines. Now, passing on from that, I will refer to the members as they spoke. The honourable member for Dunedin City (Mr. Barclay) said some one had a grievance, and he gave us quite a history with regard to some letter sent to him. Well, after all, let me ask you, what weight are we to place on an ex parte statement of this kind against the office and against the officers of the department, who have had no chance to refute it ; because I say em phatically that there is no wish on the part of any one in that office to do anything but what is right and proper. However, I will make it my business to ascertain if that statement was true, with regard to the Board refusing to sign the transfer or to release the mortgage until the money was actually paid, and also what were the reasons for so doing. Now, the honourable member for the Bay of Plenty also said that in introducing this Bill I gave no reasons for its necessity. It is impossible in the limited time at our disposal to go into minor details in intro- ducing an amending Bill of this kind. It is not a new measure. It has been before the country for years and years, and those who have been in the House for some little time ought to show they understand the position, and give a little more reliable information than the honourable gentleman gave to this House. The main facts were given to the House by me, and 8.0. the report from which he was quoting conveyed-at any rate, it did to my mind -- all the information any honourable member need wish to have before him. The report probably required a little looking into to find out what the figures referred to; but otherwise every member who gave it reasonable consideration would, I think, understand the position at once. However, I was pleased to hear the honour- able gentleman admit for it was a great concession from that honourable gentleman- that the Act had been of great benefit to the settlers. That admission from the other side of the House is really the best testi- mony we could have that good work is being done by the Government and by those who support them in this House. The honour- able member also referred to the fact that settlers have to pay a certain fee for valuations. Well, would it be possible for the Advances to Settlers Department to lend money unless they conducted their operations on fairly sound busi- ness lines? If a man wishes to have his pro- perty valued, and pays the fee, the valuation is made for him. The fee, of course, is paid to the valuer, and it would really be impossible and quite unreasonable for any applicant to expect that his fee would be returned to him, even 
<page:244>
If the department were to initiate a system to- ¡ morrow of making valuations free they would At practically be deluged with applications. the same time I do not agree with solicitors i making undue charges. Sir, I know that the responsible officer of the department is doing his best in the interests of the department, and it is the wish, I believe, of the Valuer- General to reach what we may term the " bed-rock " valuation -- one that will stand good in all cases, and act as a guide in ! all operations. But if a valuation has been made for some time it would be necessary to get a revaluation when an application came in for a loan. In any case, the cardinal prin- ciple of the whole business is the safety of the State. That point has been reiterated time and again in the House : the business must be a safe investment, and then no loss, compara- tively speaking, will result. Now, passing on, I have a few words to say to the member for Waitemata, Mr. Monk. That honourable gentle- man was greatly exercised as to the rate of interest that is to be charged. In reply to him, all I have to say is that the Government intend to proceed on the lines on which they have hitherto proceeded. They intend to raise money as cheaply as it is possible to do so, and to give to the settlers the benefit of it. That is the position the Government intend to take up; and why the honourable gentle- man should object because somebody else had to pay 1d. in the pound under the Mortgages Act, and why he should want to penalise the poorer settlers, a number of whom live in his own district, I do not understand. Two wrongs do not make a right. The honourable gentleman laid down the law very strongly, as he generally does from his point of view, but sometimes he does not start from the right premises. At any rate, there was no reason-and there is no reason - why the hard- working settler who wishes to borrow money under the Act should pay a penny more than will leave a fair and reasonable margin of profit for the State. Then, the honourable member said, " Sir, we cannot tell the results of the advances that have been made." Why, Sir, how long does that honourable gentleman expect to live ? It seems to me he will have to live as long as Methuselah before he will really understand the working out of a simple business transac- tion such as I have brought before the House. Look at the statement that is before the House now. What more does he want? It there shows very clearly that, up to the present time, the office has made advances up to $2,675,920, and the security represents no less a sum than £5,859,039 ; and so, when he realises this state- ment that is made, and which cannot be ques- tioned in this House, because it is solid fact, he should acknowledge its truth ; and when he is told that the interest has been paid punctually he ought to be satisfied, for that does away with a number of the arguments which came from the honourable member for Waitemata a few years ago, and recently as well, when he stated that the system would in Mr. Mills rowed from the State would never pay their interest. That statement has long since fairly exploded, and I think it should be fairly and publicly stated, so that the settlers who have discharged their obligations so faithfully and so well. and who are in favour of the system, should not be stigmatized as defaulters. Sir, I advise the honourable member to own up like a man that he was mistaken. Well, Sir, then my friend the member for Franklin, Mr. Massey, had a word or two to say, and he said we were not justified in bringing in the Bill, while in the same breath he tells the country and his con- stituents that he believes in the measure. Mr. MASSEY .-- Who said so ? Mr. MILLS. - There is no doubt about it, because read the honourable gentleman's I speech. Mr. MASSEY. -. Have you got it there ? Mr. MILLS .-- I am referring to your speech į in your own electorate ; I know perfectly well that what some honourable gentlemen say on the platform and what they say in the House are two very different things. Therefore I say it has been clearly and conclusively shown that there is a necessity for this Bill. The Premier went into the matter in detail, and explained why and wherefore the Bill was necessary ; and if any one will be convinced by reasonable arguments and statements such as I have alluded to from the office itself, I think they will say, "I am in favour of this measure and will vote for the second reading and vote for every word of it in Committee." Then, Sir, I am sorry to say that my honourable friend has looked at the measure with suspicion. At times his better nature seems to sink into the depths of an abyss, and he becomes very suspicious, because he said this money was not to be raised for the department. I can assure the honour- able gentleman that so long as I am the respon- sible head of that department-and I say it without fear or favour-any of this money raised here under this measure will be for the use of the department. Mr. MASSEY .- What are you going to do with the money not wanted at present for loans to settlers ? Mr. MILLS .- My reply to that is that we are not bound to raise this large sum at once ; probably it will be raised in portions as re- quired. But, as the Premier explained in the afternoon, there are times when it would be judicious to float a large loan on the London market, and every sensible man must admit that, and there are times when it would be most injudicious; but the very fact of the Government having had power for so long to raise a very much larger sum of money than would be conferred by this statute proves that they have acted wisely and judiciously and that they only raised the money when it was prac- tically required. If they had something more than was actually wanted at the time for the advances to settlers, then they have shown good business acumen by reinvesting it. Mr. MASSEY .- Where ? Mr. MILLS .- In the proper place. There- 
<page:245>
fore I do not think any one can find fault with that. With regard to the honourable mem- ber's statement that ugly rumours were about the city, I may say I have heard many ugly rumours about burglars lately-rumours about one thing and another ; but, if the honourable gentleman means that somebody is going to put his hand into the public chest and take this money out of it, all I can say is that I have never heard a word about such an absurd rumour, nor do I understand what the honour- able gentleman means. What I can assure him of is this: that the accounts are carefully and jealously guarded, and that they are given in a clear statement, which any person who wishes to investigate them can easily under- stand and rely upon. Now, Sir, I come to the statement made by my honourable friend the member for Riccarton. Mr. MASSEY .- There is another statement. What about capitalising the back interest ? Mr. MILLS .- Much as I would like to, I can- not devote any more time to the honourable member for Franklin, but with regard to what the honourable member for Riccarton, Mr. G. W. Russell, said, at first I started taking his figures down, thinking there might be some- thing in them, and that possibly this statement which I hold in my hand might, through some unfortunate circumstances, be incorrect. When I looked into it. however, and saw how he had mixed the figures, I was agreeably astonished and more than surprised at the numerous blun- ders he made. I will now ask the honourable gentleman to look at the report, and he will find that it bears me out in my assertion. Sir, he stated that we had this £760,000 at command, taking no notice of the €200,000 advance made   against it, and he immediately added to that a sum found in the statement of mortgages and instalments repaid of £155,237, and said we should have the large sum of over £900,000 to work upon. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- I said that this year it would be £175,000. Mr. MILLS .- Does the honourable member not know that item goes to the Public Trustee immediately, and that these instalments are part of the settlers' savings to redeem his pro- perty, 1 per cent. being put aside to repay the loans. The honourable member should have known that fact, especially when he presumes to be a financial critic. To say that all this amount will be paid over and over again shows how very carelessly the honourable member has studied the balance-sheet and statement ; evidently he only had a superficial glance at it, and made no attempt, even if he was compe- tent, to master its details. It was simply absurd when he said that it would all be available for lending by the Superintendent. I saw at once where he was at fault, and realised immediately that the other statements the honourable gentleman made could only have about the same weight, so were unworthy of further notice. Passing from that, I hope that later on in our history some of these loans will be floated in the colony, as was done recently in the case of another loan. If we can do this, and get the interest circulating among ourselves, it will be better for 'every one. The moment we stop our interest from going to the Old Country, and have it permeating through our own circles, I feel sure that we shall get into a much more healthy and satisfactory financial position. Then, I was asked by the leader of the Opposi- tion to explain how it was the report said on one page all the interest due was paid, and by another page showed over $4,000 owing. Well, I am afraid the honourable gentleman, with some others also, must have read this report very carelessly, because the only member who questioned the statement in the House, and who seemed to grasp the clear facts, was my honourable friend the member for Christchurch City (Mr. Smith), who is a clear-headed busi- The meaning is that the instal- ness-man. ments of interest and principal due on the 31st March, 1900, have been collected in full, but that paragraph only refers to those outstanding amounts. If you turn over the leaf you will see that the interest receivable on the 31st March, 1901, was only £4,734 6s. 7d., and, as the mortgagors only pay their interest every six months, there is bound to be some accumu- lation. There must of necessity be more or less interest owing on balancing-day in a large business such as this is. I should therefore like honourable members to think twice before making such absurd statements, because a paper such as this is, when presented to the House, is not the result of the calculations of the department itself. It has to be checked in every possible way. It has to go through the fiery furnace of the Audit Department previously to coming before this House. It has to be certified to by the Controller and Auditor - General, and surely these checks are sufficient safeguards for Parliament. There are a few other minor matters in regard to these figures that I have been asked to give an explanation of by various honourable members, but the time-limit will not permit of my doing so, and I must therefore again refer them to the report and balance-sheet, or take an oppor- tunity of doing it another time. Or, if any honourable gentleman will come to me or write to me at any time pointing out where they consider anything is wrong, I shall be only too glad to see whether there is any blame attached to the department. I must just say this before I sit down : The honourable mem- ber for Geraldine pointed out how unfair the leaseholders wishing to borrow on their pro- perties were treated in comparison with the freeholders. Well, of course, there are mem- bers in the House who hold very strong views about the difference in those two qualifica- tions ; but I would point this out : that formerly if you went to the money-market in order to borrow money on your leasehold you would have been told the lender could not make any advance on your leasehold at all, no matter what the improvements were ; but they always took care to include it in the mortgage-as the solicitor would say, " just as collateral security." Well, that day has passed by. At any rate, the department is 
<page:246>
lending up to 50 per cent. on the value of the improvements on those leaseholds, and that, I think, is a very fair advance. Now, it does not seem to be generally understood that if a borrower wants to know what his place is valued at he can send to the office and the Superintendent will give him the informa- tion. I should like to say, also, in reply to the honourable member for the Grey, Mr. Guinness, and the honourable member for the Southern Maori District, Mr. Parata, who in the inte- rests of their constituents both referred to the necessity for extending the measure so as to enable advances to be made on Native leases held under the Nelson and West Coast Native Reserves Act, that their proposal is a matter I can give no definite answer on ; but I will bring their request before Cabinet and advise them what decision is arrived at later on. Sir, I have to thank honourable members for their fair and reasonable criticisms of the measure, and I am pleased to see so much unanimity, for I can gather by the look of members around me they are all in favour of the measure, although there is a slight difference of opinion as to the amount which should be borrowed. In con- clusion, I can assure honourable members after the Bill passes there will be the same care exercised in raising the money as the Go- vernment has displayed in the past, and full consideration given as to what amount it is advisable to raise at a time. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton). -- I wish to make a personal explanation. The honour- able gentleman stated that I misinterpreted the position with regard to the $175,000 I said would be available for mortgages and instal- ments in addition to the amount in hand. Mr. MILLS .- €155,000. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- It was $155,000 last year, and I estimated with the increased sum lent during last year, it would be about £175,000 this year. To show that I am cor- rect I desire to quote the 3rd subsection of section 55 of "The Government Advances to Settlers Act, 1894 " :- "The Colonial Treasurer may, however, from time to time direct the Public Trustee to pay over such sinking fund, or any part thereof, to the Superintendent for reinvestment on mort- gages under this Act as part of the Debenture Fund, and the Public Trustee shall obey such direction." Mr. MILLS .- I still think the honourable gentleman mixed up the figures, and very much so too. Bill read a second time. # RATING ON UNIMPROVED VALUES BILL (No. 1). Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- This Bill is simplicity itself. I will read clause 2 of the Bill to honourable members to save time :- "From and after the commencement of this Act all rates shall be made and levied on the 'unimproved value ' of 'land' as such terms are respectively defined in section two of ' The Government Valuation of Land Act Amend- ment Act, 1900.'" Mr. Mills Now, that is the Bill. I might have said this Bill is a repeal of section 6 of "The Rating on Unimproved Value Act, 1896." At the pre- sent time, before rating on the unimproved value can obtain under section 5 there has to be a percentage of the ratepayers to petition the local body. A poll has to be taken, and if the proposal is carried by a majority, then the Rating on Unimproved Value Act applies to that local district. That is the existing law. Public opinion and experience has proved that there should be no necessity whatever for taking polls declaring whether or not the Act should apply. I am speaking now from experience. In the number of polls which have been taken I think there have been only five or six where the proposals have been rejected, as against some forty that have been carried. The feeling throughout the country is that there ought to be one system, and I say it is a safe system. I should be surprised to hear any member of the House defending rating under the present conditions. The improving squatter, the im- proving farmer, and the improving frecholder, either in town or country -- I say, as the law now stands he is penalised locally for his thrift and for his improvements. That is what is the matter. The man who will not improve, who will not employ labour, and who simply makes his money on tussock, gets the advantage, because his neighbour who has im- proved is taxed for local rates three times as much in some instances as the man who makes no improvements. I say there is only so much money wanted to be raised for local purposes. and I say it is unfair, in respect to local taxation, to penalise the improver. And I say again, if it is fair and right and righteous that for taxation. for raising money for the nation, you shall raise your money on the unimproved value, exclud- ing improvements, how can you consistently, then, say that for local purposes there shall he another system ? It is illogical entirely, and 1 am satisfied that if you had a referendum to- morrow of this country on this question --- An Hon. MEMBER. - There is no chance while you have got the present Upper House. Mr. SEDDON .- I am surprised at the delight of honourable members at the Bill being thrown out in another place. It shows they were in- sincere in supporting it in the House. I should not be surprised if they have been using their influence with the members of the other House to throw out that Bill. I am surprised at the delight of honourable members opposite when I mentioned the word " referendum," and said if a referendum were taken- An Hon. MEMBER .- We knew it would be thrown out. Mr. SEDDON .- I read of a lady the other day who for fortune-telling lost her liberty ; and the member for Waitemata, if he goes on prophesying like this, will run a risk. But let us come back to the question at issue. 8.30. The question at issue is whether or not we ought to rate for local-government purposes on the unimproved value. I say that as intro- duced this year it is even in its infancy, but the results are most encouraging. It does not 
<page:247>
penalise the man who improves. I need only take members down Molesworth Street here, and they will see a lot of old buildings which are a discredit to a town of such importance as this city. I will not call them "hovels," but they are buildings which were erected some forty years ago, and that land is now worth from $50 to £100 a foot, and to see buildings of that class on land which is of such value seems to me to be monstrous. An enterprising owner of land, of course, erects a magnificent building, and gradually the land is improved in value ; but under the present system the person who takes an up-to-date shop that has been erected on that land has to pay five times the rates that his neighbour has to pay who is utilising one of these poor buildings. Now, that man gets just as much from the use of the street as the man who has erected these fine buildings, and carries on his business year after year to a great advan- tage in regard to the payment of rates. Mem- bers would scarcely believe it, but I am told that there are three or four of these buildings in Molesworth Street-and I do not know that you can have a stronger argument-that at the time of the plague scare were condemned and had to be pulled down as being insanitary and unfit for occupation. Therefore, if you have such a condition of things in your prin- cipal city of this colony, and in its main thoroughfares, it is worse really than to have the vacant plot ; and I say that the time has arrived when you should put your rating for local purposes on a fair basis, for all that land will then be improved, and the man who owns it will have to do the same as his neighbour, because he cannot very well afford to con- tinue to maintain the tenements that now exist on the land. Mr. BOLLARD .- Punish the man, and make him erect new buildings. Mr. SEDDON .- No, I do not punish the man at all. I simply say, Why should he reap the advantage of other people's expenditure ? Why should he not be rated for local purposes the same as the other, because his property is in the public avenues, and his premises com- mand the same amount of public conveniences, pathways, streets, lighting, et cetera, as the premises of the man who has put up a magnifi- cent set of buildings ? Mr. W. FRASER .- You cannot apply it to the country-apply it to the towns. Mr. SEDDON .- It applies to the country too. You will find that, if it is in a distriet where they cannot improve, the property-owners will always be on the same footing. At all events, I will come back to the other matter and deal with the local plot question, or the vacant plot question. As members are aware, there are in towns vacant plots of land where in some instances the owners are absent from the colony. Sometimes you cannot find their addresses, and it is only when a boom commences and high prices are ruling that the owners turn up. Some, to their sorrow, have taken these sections as being ownerless, but events have subsequently proved that the owners were there, but were lying back quietly allowing the thrifty and the enterprising residents to go on making improve- ments, paying all the time rates and taxes, and after the land had quadrupled in value, although during the interval the rates they had paid had only been one-fifth of what was paid by the other improving ratepayers, they quietly dis- posed of those vacant plots at a very large profit. I say a large share of that profit has been made out of the enterprise of their fellow-ratepayers, who have been penalised. That has been and is the existing system of our rating on the capital values, taking the improvements into considera- tion. At all events, after carefully noting what has been going on throughout the country, I am pleased to see that where the experiment has been tried in the country districts-in the counties-they are all well satisfied with the results. Hon. MEMBERS .- No, no. Mr. SEDDON .- Well, I would like any member to stand up in the House and give us a case where it has not been so. Mr. MASSEY .- I will give you one. Mr. SEDDON .- All I know is that wherever they have brought the Act into force they are very well satisfied-in fact, I have not heard of one to the contrary. If the member for Franklin has met with an isolated case which he can give to the House, that will be good reason for say- ing its application should not be general, because the exception proves the rule, and there may be local conditions in perhaps one isolated case that may militate against this system being fair in its incidence. Probably the remedy in that case would be, if we carried the Bill and made its application general, that in a case such as the honourable member referred to we might give them, on the vote by the rate- payers, the opportunity of coming from under the Act and reverting back to the old system. An Hon. MEMBER .- How? Mr. SEDDON .- By making the same pro- vision that there is under the Act now for bringing all the rest in : reverse the position. Mr. MASSEY .- That is not in the Bill. Mr. SEDDON. - The reverse is in the Bill. Mr. MASSEY .- You do not say so. Mr. SEDDON .- I have said you can amend the Bill in that direction if there is an isolated case that you know. If you made the law general in its application, that all local bodies should rate on the unimproved value, and there was a local authority, or those within the bounds of a local authority, whose conditions and the incidence were such as not to make it fair, then they, on the votes of a majority of the ratepayers so desiring it, could come from under the rating on unimproved value and go back to the old system. That is what I men- tioned could be done. Mr. MASSEY .- Will you put something of that nature in ? Mr. SEDDON .- I shall have no objection to the honourable member moving in the matter. If you have a special case where there was hardship, and they want to come from under it, and by a majority of votes the ratepayers and burgesses decide to do so, then 
<page:248>
is this : I do not see why we should not make this the basis of our system of rating; when in every case almost, I think, there have been nearly ten to one cases recorded in favour of this system wherever it has been tried as against those who have been unfavourable to it. And the strongest argument of all is that there ought to be uniformity in respect of our system of taxation. If, therefore, we find the tax on the unimproved value works fairly, it is fair to rate and tax for local purposes on the same basis. I do not know, Sir, that there is any further elabora- tion required, except that under the 2nd section of the Bill. As the law now stands, section 20 of the original Act provides that, although carried by a majority of ratepayers under the existing law that the rating shall be on the unimproved value, that will not apply to water rates, gas rates, electric-light rates, sewage rates, or hospital and charitable aid rates, and the argu- ment, of course, is of great force that if it is right that the general rate should be on the un- improved value, why in respect of these other rates should there be any distinction ? That is the argument, and I have never heard an answer to it vet, except that, as a matter of ex- pediency, and as we were experimenting, this clause 20 was put in the Bill. But surely a drainage rate or a sewage rate is for an im- provement which, if necessary to a town, bene- fits all the property in it, and the property that is benefited should pay evenly and fairly for the improvement. But it does not do so at the pre- sent time. And the same applies where water is  brought in. If a water-supply is obtained, the whole of the property of a town, from that one act, is improved in value; but, when it comes to paying rates to meet the interest on the loan     for the construction of waterworks, again the improver, again the man of enterprise, is penal- ised, and the man who has a vacant allotment pays a nominal amount. Now that the rate- payers by large numbers have agreed that the rating shall be upon the unimproved value, why should it not apply to rates other than the general rate ? However, I know that I am on dangerous ground here, and so as to let those down lightly who differ from me in this respect I have left this matter for the decision of the local body :- " This section shall not apply to the rates mentioned in section twenty of the principal Act unless the local authority by special order declares that such rates shall be made and levied under this section." It practically, therefore, rests with the local authorities, if the Bill becomes law, as regards these special rates, whether it applies to them or not. At the same time, if when the Bill is in Committee there seems to be a strong desire that it shall be made mandatory right through, I shall not fight very keenly for this provision that I have placed here. I will leave it, of course, to the Committee. In the meantime I do not think it necessary to say anything further. I expect honourable members' minds are pretty well made up on the question, and I Mr. Seddon value must have been demonstrated, and, such being the case, the time has arrived for us to have the law brought into conformity with public opinion. That being so, I move the second reading of the Bill. Captain RUSSELL (Hawke's Bay). - The Right Hon. the Premier says our minds are made up about this Bill, or most of them are. Mine, at any rate, is, and it has been made up for several years past. I am thoroughly convinced that the attempt to discover the unimproved value of land is as futile as the pursuit of a Will - o' - the - wisp. I was interested to hear the Right Hon. the Premier, in his argument, quite uncon- sciously to himself, depart from the principles he usually lays down. He usually says it is solely the increase of population that creates the value of property. Mr. SEDDON .- I did not say it was the only one. Captain RUSSELL .- That is the general line of argument of the Premier. To-night what did he say? I think seven-eighths was the proportion that he used. I do not suppose that he would be particular whether he used one-eighth more or less as the proportion of in- creased values of urban properties caused by rates levied upon the properties. However, to- night he admitted the improvements made by roads, by bridges, by gas and water were all paid for by local rates, and to those rates was due the increased value of properties. I was extremely pleased to hear him say that, be- cause, speaking purely as a country man, I have never been able to realise where unearned incre- ment commenced. An Hon. MEMBER .- You have to accept that from the valuer. Captain RUSSELL .- The valuer ordinarily knows less about the unearned increment than the owner of the property. He is generally a man who knows nothing about successful farming or he would not be a valuer. I think it was Disraeli who described a critic as "a man who had failed in literature or art." So I say a land-valuer is usually a man who has failed to work any property successfully, and therefore is appointed to value other men's But the Premier wailed about the work. unbuilt-upon allotments in the towns; and there, again, he departed from his usual stock arguments. I have heard him in this House rail about the necessity of pulling down the cab-shelter sheds in Wellington, because in this the windiest place in the world there was no spaces for the people to breath in -- no lung- room for the city. When he wants to pull down sheds and make vacant places to suit his own prejudices his argument is an entirely different one from the one he uses now. But if we are seeking after hygiene, if we are anxious that the people should be healthy, why not encourage the people to keep vacant spaces in the large cities, rather than by ever-increasing taxation compelling them to build whether they wish to or not. 
<page:249>
places in Wellington. Captain RUSSELL. - I have heard that there is a garden somewhere between Golder's Hill and Molesworth Street, and that there the Premier wants to make a solitude surrounding his own house ; but he will find by doing so he is not creating peace. But, Sir, if in the city it is difficult to conceive what the unimproved value of a section really is, it is still more so to describe how hardly it bears upon the back- block settler and upon the country residents. Parliament has not yet begun to hear about the grievances of the country settlers, but it will hear a good deal about them as time goes on. Of all unequal systems of taxation that upon so-called unimproved value is the most nefarious, for, while it practically taxes every improvement put into a farm, it exempts the buildings erected by the denizens of the towns and those of the rich residents in the suburbs of the cities. Though for local taxation this may not be important, for any general scheme of taxation it is most iniquitous. The Pre- mier told us in his speech to-night of the hardships of the man who makes a start in the back blocks and has his property taxed. But, Sir, I thoroughly understand he does not realise the position of that pioneer settler. He is one of those honourable members, of whom there are a great many in this House, who know nothing of the difficulties of the pioneer settler. Let us take the case of a struggling settler un- der the proposal to tax his unimproved value. From the very moment when the man takes up a piece of ground-which has hitherto been almost untrodden on by the foot of man, where there are no roads and no signs of civilisation and no advantages, where everything he buys is carried in under extreme difficulty, and where there is no local store at which he can obtain the few necessaries he must have to keep body and soul together - he is to have imposed on him taxation on the full selling-value of his farm. That is to say, he is to be taxed on its unimproved value. Alas, poor man ! his property is all unimproved. He buys it as Nature made it. And then, for- sooth, we are not to tax a man who has accumu- lated wealth ; it is called "taxing his thrift" ; but we are to tax to the uttermost this man who takes up a waste of country. There may be resident only a few miles from him a man of wealth, who has inherited, possibly, from some one an estate in good working condition, and out of which he can derive an immediate income. But the man who is in affluence is to be taxed practically at the same rate as the wretched man who has not had an axe swung on his property, who has no sheds, no fences, no drains, no house, no barns. He is to be taxed exactly to the same extent as the man who has a farm in a paying condition. I may be told that to tax a farm in a paying condition is a tax on thrift. I do not care whether we tax thrift or not. It is a catchy phrase, but there is nothing in this world that is taxable but thrift, unless a poll-tax. Until a man has by thrift accumulated something there is nothing farm or establish a business, and therefore you Unfortunately, Sir, I have not tax his thrift. brought with me an interesting correspondence that took place not long ago about the taxation of some properties on the West Coast. I think it was in the vicinity of Marton. It has been im- possible there to arrive at anything like an equal system of taxation. It is held by all of us who live in the country that we are indifferent as to a value being struck on our property so long as there is some reasonable basis on which the valuation is fixed and the taxation is imposed ; but under our present system of taxation, which, I contend, will be made more cumber- some and less intelligible under the proposi- tions now before us, there is no understandable basis of taxation whatsoever. There is no en- deavour to establish definitely the value of the best property in the district and also the value of the worst property in the district, so that between the two extremes a fair relative value of all the others may be arrived at, so that people will know they are to be rated according to the relative value of their property to that of the whole district. The consequence is that all through the country-at any rate, in the part where I live-there is the very gravest dissatis- faction with the valuations, which often bear absolutely no relation one to another. The valuations which are imposed have no relation one to the other, and so the people are dissatis- fied. I may be asked, What has that to do with rating on unimproved values? Because if it is impossible at the present time to ascertain a true basis for taxation, the only true basis of which, according to my views, should be that of the selling-value of the property, for it seems to me there is no other true value on which you can ascertain the sum on which a property can be taxed than what is the actual selling- value in the market -- if that value is fixed all through a district, I cannot see that there would be any injustice in the amount of a tax if all the properties in that district were taxed proportionately to their value to sell. But so long as a system is employed, such as we are suffering under at the present moment, of imposing taxation in a purely empirical manner, I maintain there will be the greatest dissatis- faction ; and it must be so, because there is no true and natural basis upon which that taxa- tion is being imposed. Now, I commenced by saying there is a vast difference between the imposition of taxation upon the unimproved values in the country and in the towns, and that that form of taxation would be a material hardship to the persons owning property in the country. I recognise that for the purposes of local taxation my argument is of little appli- cation, so long as in the particular local govern- ing district there is equality of valuation. But when it is applied relatively to the country and to the town for the purposes of general taxa- tion, then the hardship commences. Why, Sir, it is believed-at any rate, I believe it most thoroughly- that instructions are given-per- haps "instructions " is too strong a word, but, at any rate, there is an intimation given-to 
<page:250>
ments as low as they possibly can, and that they are to fix the unimproved values as high as they can. Well, the intimation -- An Hon. MEMBER .-- An intuition. Captain RUSSELL. - An intuition - what the precise and proper word is I really do not know. I hear the Right Hon. the Premier groaning; he recognises we are discovering his little tricks, but so it is. Mr. SEDDON .- You are doing a grave in- justice to good, honest, and upright public officers. Captain RUSSELL .- I am extremely sorry I should do a grave injustice to anybody, and I am not prepared to go so far as to say there is proof of this ; but I do go so far as to reiterate that it is universally believed that that in- timation or intuition has gone abroad amongst the valuers-and the valuers, at any rate, act upon that principle. Well, now, we find this also : that not only is the sum allowed for im- provements reduced to what is becoming-I was going to say an irreducible minimum ; they have unfortunately all but arrived at it-but continually we hear, "Oh, that is an exhausted improvement ": and the process of exhaustion is going on year by year and month by month, and I may almost say day by day. The im- provements being put upon country properties are, according to the valuers, daily becoming exhausted. I have in my mind's eye the case of country that has been under dense bush, where the timber has been felled, where in due course of time the land has been stumped, after  having been logged and burnt off, and that pro- perty, which was originally primeval forest, has been brought into what is called a highly im- proved condition, with the result that the cost #cc-zero of bringing the land into that condition has been greater than the actual selling-value of the property so cleared. Then. I would ask, How in a case such as this is it possible to ascertain what is the unimproved value ? What unimproved value has the land if the money it has cost to bring it into the con- dition in which it is has been equal to or greater than the selling - value? I have in my mind's eye also another instance -- the case of a swamp which was almost bottomless, where drains were dug to a certain depth with spade and shovel when they first were cut, next, at almost incalculable expense, with the axe and adze through buried timber, and by degrees this land has been drained and has be- come dry. The swamp, which was a quaking bog, has become valuable paddocks, carrying great quantities of stock and growing good crops. And yet we are told that because some of the drains are no longer running drains-they have been so once, but only carry water now at certain seasons-on that account they are exhausted improvements, and no allowance is made for them. I have been told actually of a case of a man who drained by subsoil drains, and the valuer went over the country and said he could see nothing but grass, and good grass, and he could not allow for any improvements he could not see, and therefore the cost of pounds per Captain Russell as improvements at all, because, indeed, it was an improvement the valuer could not see. I can tell how plantations have been made, but which, being young, have no saleable value, so are not called improvements. I have been told that they could not be taken into account be- cause they were not saleable. I have known thousands of pounds in river - bank protection works - willows planted at great expense-and have been told that willows are an unsaleable commodity, and therefore river-protection works could not be charged as improvements. These illustrations are given to show how the system of rating on unimproved value works out in prac- tice. More and more the tendency is to reduce the country settler to the position of a man who has no improvements, because, under instruc- tions from the department, nothing will be allowed for improvements such as felling bush and grassing land after a certain period of time, because they are improvements that become ex- hausted. As an illustration of how injurious it will be, relatively speaking, for the country settler as against the man in the town, take the case of a man living in the suburbs who has a vegetable garden, from which he supplies the town with fresh vegetables. Alongside him is the mansion of a successful business-man or successful pro- fessional man. He has probably expended on this mansion £7,000 or $10,000, and there it towers up towards the sky, an untaxed improve- ment never to be "exhausted." The farmer, who has spent €10,000, and is causing two blades of grass to grow where one had been growing before, is penalised ; his £10,000 spent in im- provements is soon exhausted, while the man with the mansion is let off scot-free. Should that system of taxation meet with universal approbation ? The Hon. the Premier tells us that wherever the case has been submitted to the ratepayers ten to one have voted in favour of rating on unimproved values, and that there had been no recession from the view that the alteration has been desirable. Mr. SEDDON .- That is the position at pre- sent. Captain RUSSELL .- It may be so. I can- not deny the accuracy of the statement, for I do not know the cases in point; but I do not think the people have thought the matter out for themselves if they have agreed to this. The Premier referred to the case of the holders of small tenements in Molesworth Street, and he said it was absurd that they should pay less taxation than those who lived close by in large houses. I do not at all agree with that theory. Because people live in small tenements it does not follow that they are bad citizens. They may be very deserving persons, although they may not have sufficient capital to put up large houses. Take as an illustration the case of the owner of a small house and the Gear Company, which owns a large shop and meat-preserving works on Lambton Quay. Am I to be told that a concern that has twenty or thirty carts con- stantly running on the streets, and which does an enormous business, is to be taxed only on the same footing as regards taxation as the poor 
<page:251>
artisan who chances to have a site on the Quay on which he has a four-roomed cottage on an equal road-frontage? In theory that may be all right, but in practice it would be monstrous; at least, I think so. Take another illustration of, say, a large linen-draper's establishment, from which carriages and cabs are perpetually pass- ing to and fro. It is surely only right that that person should- Mr. SEDDON .- Vehicles are nearly all re- quired to be licensed. Captain RUSSELL .- That has nothing to do with this argument. Surely it is right that a man who is doing an enormous business, turning over, as I believe is done in some cases, over a hundred thousand a year, should be in a different category so far as taxation, both local and general, is concerned from the man who lives in a small house. It seems to me that this principle of rating on unimproved value is one of those principles which people talk about, though they cannot really grasp it ; and, in fact, from what I gather, the Premier himself scarcely has a belief in his own Bill. At the present time, as the law stands, the Act can be brought into operation by a ballot of the ratepayers in any district. Now, the right honourable gentle- man proposes by this Bill to make the Act turn a somersault, and, instead of persons who wish to bring the Act into operation having to get up a petition to do so, he says, in fact, that there shall be compulsory valuation on unimproved values unless a petition is got up in the opposite direction. Mr. SEDDON .- I was only pointing out to the honourable member for Franklin a way out of the difficulty. Captain RUSSELL .- Quite so ; but I think I have estimated the position of the Right Hon. the Premier quite correctly. Any body of ratepayers who wish to petition themselves out of the Bill shall be allowed to do so. am sure the Premier cannot deny that that is practically what he said. And I think we are invited simply to reverse the position. The Bill is absolutely compulsory ; but the Right Hon. the Premier told us he was prepared to put in an amendment to make it voluntary. Well, the difficulty is, when there are two Bills both introduced by the Government, for one to know what either means, and one is rather at a loss. But under the Bill I have before me, with the name of the Right Hon. R. J. Seddon at the head of it, in clause 3 there are some of the most extraordinary pieces of doctrine I can con- ceive. It says,- "' The Rating Act, 1894,' and the principal Act, and all other Acts in conflict with this Act, are hereby repealed to the extent of such con- flict, but not further or otherwise." Well, Sir, one hears that many Bills are drafted for the express purpose of giving em- ployment to the lawyers, and this must be one of them. But whether this Act will come into conflict with some other Act, or what that other Act is, or whether there is a single local government Act which might not come into conflict with this Bill it is impossible to say. I would urge upon the Right Hon. the Premier modify, and clause by clause have it placed before the House, so that the House will be able to understand what the repeals or modifi- cations are. I have no doubt in my own mind that the system of rating on unimproved value must prove a failure. At any rate, I am pre- pared to vote against this Bill, and to divide the House against it. Mr. STEVENS (Manawatu) .- Sir, I am very much surprised at some of the statements made by the honourable member for Hawke's Bay. No doubt the honourable member has had a very wide experience in country settlement, and a considerable experience also with respect to the various kinds of rating in this colony. But, Sir, when the honourable gentleman stands up in his place in this House and says that some- thing occurred in a particular locality which he could not understand one can easily understand that the honourable gentleman was somewhat fogged in respect to the whole question upon which he has been speaking. Now, I will help the honourable gentleman out of the difficulty as to what occurred in the locality of Marton, to which he referred, and when he has heard my explanation he may be satisfied that upon other points in connection with this matter he may have been as much mistaken as he has been in connection with the various kinds of rating in the locality of Marton. There is an estate there, and when the valua- tion was made for the purpose of rating on unimproved value, when the Land-tax Act first came into force-I am not speaking of the Act introduced by Sir George Grey, but the existing Act . this is what did occur : In the locality of Marton, to which the honourable gentleman referred, there was an estate the unimproved value of which was fixed at 7s. 6d. per acre ; but, on the opposite side of the road, the land being practically equal, there was a thrifty I farmer who had erected his farm-steading and good outhouses and fences, and had his farm well laid down in grass ; and his unimproved value was $7 per acre. That was Heaton Park in one case, and Mr. Hempseed's property in the other. I know what I am talking about. and that is exactly what did occur. Now we come to something that occurred more recently. The unimproved value of another portion of the Heaton Park, nearer Bull's, was $6 per acre, and a small property on the other side of the road, belonging to Mr. Stevenson, of Bull's, was. valued at #14. He pays taxes on £14 per acre to the local bodies, and the Heaton Park pays taxes on £6 per acre. An Hon. MEMBER. - The same class of land ? Mr. STEVENS .- Exactly the same class of land in the latter case. I wish to be perfectly fair and not mislead the House or the honour- able gentleman, and I will say there is a great deal of the Heaton Park land that is not worth €7, or anything like it, because a great deal is light land lying at the back. But it is absurd to say that the value of that estate, taking it all over-sandhills included-is not worth at least £3 an acre. This I am prepared to say : that if it were put in the market to-morrow, 
<page:252>
purchase the improvements afterwards, he would get a very cheap bargain. These are two points. Captain RUSSELL. - I can assure the honourable gentleman I had neither of those cases in my mind's eye. Mr. STEVENS. - Well, I am merely pointing this out as a circumstance which did occur in the locality of Marton, to which the honourable gentleman referred. Now, another point : There is a portion of land belonging to the same estate which is leased at present to the firm of Walker and Nolan. The area is about forty acres, and so far as I know, the value per acre put on that property for rating purposes is about $6 or $7 ; the last valuation I remember was €6. Now, all round that property are small holdings be- longing to small settlers, who have good improve- ments on their land, and pay at the rate of ₺14 or £15 per acre. So if the principle be right that we should have a land-tax based upon the unimproved value of the land for general taxation, it must necessarily follow that the principle should apply to all kinds of taxa- tion, whether for local or general purposes. It is absolutely impossible to say you can make a division in a great principle. Are we to levy our taxation on the improved value of the land, or upon the unimproved value of the land ? The honourable member who spoke last said it was impossible to ascertain what the unimproved value of land is. I admit that it is impossible to ascertain it to the finest point. It is impossible to ascertain what a straight line is, but it is as nearly possible to ascertain what the unimproved value is as it is to ascertain what a straight line is. If you take a piece of prairie land of, say, a hundred acres situated in the centre of a large block which has been cut up and subdivided, im- proved, and roaded, does the honourable mem- ber mean to say that the unimproved value of that land to-day would be what it was valued at many years ago before the improvements were made? Therefore, I say that the un- earned increment brings that land from, say, $1 to $10 per acre, and that the unimproved value to-day would be £10 per acre. as compared with €1 per acre before any improvements were made in the vicinity of the land. That is what I call the unimproved value. Some members say that is the unearned increment. So it is. The owner of that hundred acres of land would have received, if he were to sell his land, the unearned increment, and he would be one of the leeches who live and fatten upon the thrifty and industrious settler. The honour- able member for Hawke's Bay said that the Gear Company used the roads very largely, and it made an enormous sum of money, therefore why should they not pay more than a small holder who only owned a cottage or small holding ? If the honourable member had reflected a little he would have seen that the Gear Company does pay a great deal more, because it is a great business concern, and it pays taxation upon its annual income, whereas the small person who makes no profit pays Mr. Stevens with the valuation of land which I have always held to be right and correct, and that is, whether it be for local taxation or whether it be for general taxation, the House should insist that whenever a valuation is made in a locality the settlers in that locality should have a time of rest ; the value fixed for the locality should be fixed for a definite period, irrespective of isolated sales. It matters not whether a property be sold in the immediate vicinity at, say, £10 an acre, the original value should stand. Although the land was valued by the valuer at #7 per acre, and the property was subsequently sold at $10 per acre, the new purchaser of such property should not be compelled to pay more than his neighbour. To my mind, it is vexatious, it serves no good purpose, and it discourages people from pur- chasing land and going into the country and settling there, believing, as they do now, that they are to be pointed at and spotted for the purpose of -- what ? Increasing by a few pounds the land-tax. All taxation, in my opinion, should be levied, as it were, for a fixed period. It matters not how long the period be, but within that period the owner of this land should be able to feel that he will be at rest. Let him rest for that particular period-let it be one year, two years, or three years. I shall not define the period ; but I do say that one of the greatest complaints I have heard from the settlers throughout the district I have the honour to represent is that immediately a pro- perty changes hands and the purchaser of that property wishes to become a thrifty settler - after he pays a high price for it and is willing to improve his property-he is immediately penalised as against his neighbour who has not sold his property. I think that is un- fair, and I hope the Government will take into consideration the necessity of fixing periodically what the valuation shall be. and that, in the event of the property changing hands within that period, there shall not be any change made in the valuation. For ex- ample, say there are a number of properties valued at $7 per acre in a certain locality, and three days hence one of those properties is sold for €10 per acre. The purchaser of that pro- perty at $10 per acre is compelled to pay on the $10 per acre for the period for which the original valuation was made, whereas his neigh- bour, who owns land of equal value, gets off \-- with £7 per acre. If, on the other hand, the sale of one of those properties for $10 an acre raises the value of the whole of the properties to £10 an acre, it is not logical, it is not reason- able. that the proprietor of one property which is of equal value to the other should pay from 25 per cent. to 30 per cent. more taxation than the proprietor of the other property in the same locality, and having the same valuation. I have nothing further to say other than this: that I have always held that, if the unimproved value be correct in respect to general taxation, it must necessarily follow that it is right and correct with respect to local taxation. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton) .- Sir, I 
<page:253>
before the House, and in doing so I shall not attempt to follow the remarks made by the member for Manawatu. It appeared to me that the honourable gentleman does not un- derstand the principle underlying any proper system of taxation. Now, Sir, I am one of those who have always doubted the wisdom of rating on the unimproved value, and I shall proceed to state how I think the operation of this principle will work in the district I have the honour to represent. I think that can be taken as a fair sample of the condition of things throughout the colony. Without further hesitation I may say that I regard the system of rating on the unimproved value as the exemption of the wealthy man to the detriment of the poor. The district I have the honour to represent contains a large number of dwellings belonging to wealthy men. It is probably, for its size, one of the wealthiest portions of New Zealand. It is the wealthiest suburb of the City of Christchurch. It contains numerous large grain-stores; it contains the finest racecourse in the colony, and one of the largest freezing-works. Now, Sir, under the rating on the unimproved value all the wealthy class represented by these large dwellings, racecourse properties, freezing-works, and so on, will be exempted from part of their present taxation, and I put it to honourable members in this way: If you are going to exempt all these valuable properties from taxation on their improvements, where is the money to come from in order to make up the total  amount of taxation that is required for local purposes? That, as it appears to me, is a position from which there is absolutely no escape. Now, the Premier spoke of vacant lots. Well, that is always a captivating cry. But I would ask the honourable gentleman is there not some point at which you must stop building? That point is when you have sup- plied the demand. It is all very well in a city like Wellington, where the land is circum- scribed and where the buildings can hardly be put up fast enough, to force the pace in build- ing ; but take a city like Christchurch and its suburbs. If you are going to compel by taxa- tion, such as you propose here, the erection of properties beyond the point where those properties can be profitably occupied you are simply going to empty one lot of buildings by compelling the erection of another and su- perior lot. Sir, I can take my memory back to the time when as a boy I lived in the Town of Invercargill. That town was overbuilt, and I can remember in 1863 to 1865 the owners were asking people to come and live in their houses for the pur- pose of protecting them from being destroyed by persons of a depredatory tendency. And exactly the same position will take place in any town, city, or borough when once you, by any process whatever, force the erection of buildings past the point where the law of supply and demand operates. I have seen other cases illustrating that. Even in the Town of Palmerston North I can quote a case fourteen or fifteen years ago being enormously depreciated in value by the fact that other buildings have been erected by capitalists de- siring to utilise vacant lots and get interest upon their capital. Having erected new and improved tenements, they have emptied the older class of buildings and depreciated their value. Exactly the same thing will take place in any town or city where you have pushed the construction of buildings by fictitious or ab- normal means beyond the law of supply and demand. That, I believe, will be one of the effects. Now let me refer to the idea that all land is of equal value, and that therefore rating on land-value alone is equitable. I say that it is not, and the man who gets four or five uses of his land ought to pay more in taxa- tion than the man who is only using his land once. Take the City of Christchurch : In Cathedral Square you have some sections of land which carry buildings three or four stories high, like the A.M.P. Company's buildings. They have the use of that land three and four times through the letting of the cellar and flat upon flat, and all the offices are occupied. Do you mean to tell me the people who own that class of building in Christchurch do not get more value from their land than the people whose buildings beside them are of only a single story, and which they are able to let for offices at only from £1 to #1 10s. a week ? These two classes of people, those with buildings of three and four stories on their land and those with only a single-story building-do they get the same use out of their properties? Why, Sir, the thing will not hold water for a moment. The man who builds a Chicago "sky-scraper" fourteen or fifteen stories high is, under this Bill, entitled only to pay rates on the same plot of land as the man alongside him who puts up a single-story building. And if the latter is entitled to pay as much in rates as the former, where are you going to get the taxes with which to carry on your local govern- ment ? I ask honourable members, What is the underlying principle upon which our local- government taxation depends ? Is it that we try to fasten taxation on the individual ? If so, why not abolish taxation upon property altogether, and have a poll-tax? If you are going to tax property according to the protection and assistance that property gets in the way of protection, and all that a good system of local government does for property, then on what logical ground can you say that the land only is to be taxed, and that the properties that are built on it are to be exempted ? For my part, I cannot see any reason in that argument. Now, Sir, 1 hold- and in this respect I know I differ from a number of Liberals in this House -- I hold that when you take away the taxation of the "fat man," you are going to place that taxation upon the poorer classes. Take, for example, the dis- trict of Sydenham, in which I live, near to Christchurch. Why, Sir, for a number of years past the great gasworks which supply the whole of the City of Christchurch-the proprietors of 
<page:254>
-those gasworks have been paying rates to the Borough of Sydenham, but under the unim- proved land - valuation they are exempt. So are the great grain-stores, and the bonded stores. Now, all this taxation which is taken . serewed on, and if one turn did not do it, then off these valuable properties has to be made up , he would give it another, and so on. The by somebody. You cannot get away from that ; , speech made a sensation at the time, and was the same amount of money must come in to carry on local government, and if it is not coming from wealthy companies, the pro- ; prietors of gasworks and bonded stores, some- body else has got to pay it. You may say that that will be equalised over the whole of the lands. That may be so, where you have large boroughs including much unoccupied land. Precisely, but if you force the capitalist to step in and build houses in competition with the owners of houses that are now let at reasonable rentals, you will get the houses occupied by the comparatively poor built by the wealthier men, who will look for, and can afford to accept. a lower rate of profit, whilst the houses already built and owned by poorer men will be either unoccupied or lessened in value. That will be one of the effects it will have. My opinion is that the Government in connection with this matter are swinging in the direction of the single-tax. That, Sir, is my opinion. I regard this proposal as somewhat in the nature of a pilot balloon. The Government are not pre- pared to bring in proposals for the taxing of holders of leases in perpetuity ; they are allow- ing them to escape taxation ; so in order to placate a certain advanced section of the Liberal  party in the House they are going in the direc- tion of compulsory rating upon unimproved values. Now, I would like to say this: that I am not prepared even to subscribe altogether to     the doctrine laid down by the Premier that for national purposes all improvements should be exempted. I am not fully sure you are right in that. Let me tell the honourable gentle- man that in 1890-91 he received under the property-tax $357.348 by way of direct taxa- tion. What did he receive from direct taxa- tion during the year which has closed ? Only $295,000 by way of land-tax and €173,000 by income-tax-that is, $468,000 during the year just closed through direct taxation, as against $357,000 ten years ago. I also point out that this sum showed an increase of some €50,000 over the previous year, through hardening up land-values and more rigid collection of income- tax. What has been the fact ? Why, by adopt- ing this principle for national purposes of rating on the unimproved value you have been allow- ing so much wealth to escape taxation that at the present time the Government is actually looking all round for some means by which : on unimproved value law, is one that I ap- they may increase the direct taxation, and from all I can hear they are going to put it on the graduated land-tax. Sir, if I am not mistaken - I do not wish to anticipate the Financial State- ment, but the Premier certainly indicated that possibility the other night. I shall tell him where he is getting that policy from. It is from Mr. Earnshaw. Mr. G. W. Russell Earnshaw. If honourable members will turn up one of the earliest speeches by Mr. Earnshaw in this House, they will remember the occasion when he stated that the graduated tax should be disavowed by the leaders of the Liberal party, and the honourable gentleman to-day. if he goes in the direction of increasing the graduated tax, is going to get his policy from that old speech of Mr. Earnshaw. I certainly do not envy him if he has to look in that direction for his financial policy. The effect of exempting improvements from taxation has been this : that you are not obtaining that amount from direct taxation that you have the right to expect considering the increase in the value of the property of the colony during the last ten years. I do not advocate a return to the property-tax. I am quite prepared to admit that we should in our taxation discrimi- nate between those improvements that exhaust themselves and those that do not. I do not think for one moment that a man should be taxed upon improvements that go to improve the fertility of his land, or to increase the pro- duction of his land ; but if a wealthy man, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Hawke's Bay, can build a house worth $10,000 upon a section only the same size as a market- gardener is occupying who is selling rhubarb, cabbages, and potatoes for his living, I see no reason why that man, because he spent $10,000 on buildings, should for all time be exempted, so far as the capital expended on those build- ings is concerned, from taxation for colonial and local purposes. I say, Sir, that while the law was permissive it was open to argument, and the ratepayers could exercise their option with regard to its being brought into force; but I believe, if the Government attempt to make this mandatory and com- pulsory upon all the local bodies throughout New Zealand, it will give great dissatisfaction, at any rate, in the electorate which I have the honour to represent in this House. It appears to me that if we adopt this Bill we lay down this principle : that the richer a man becomes, the more money he expends in buildings upon his property, the more he escapes taxation. There can be no logical escape from that. I have no- thing further to say except that, if any division is called for upon this Bill, for the reasons I have stated I shall feel bound to vote against the second reading. The present law, as far as it permits the localities to settle for themselves whether they will bring into force the rating prove of, but so far as it seeks to make it com- pulsory upon localities that this drastic change shall be brought into force I object to it. Mr. HANAN (Invercargill) .-- I intend to give my cordial support to the principle of rating contained in this Bill, because I believe that rating on unimproved value is the most equi- table system of rating that has yet been con- 
<page:255>
people, and prevents them being taxed on or rined for every little improvement effected on their property. It is not a tax on labour or on the man who expends capital in erecting workshops, business premises, or other build- ings in any way whatever. It is not a tax on industry, but it is a tax on value that is brought into existence by the growth of popula- tion, by the expenditure of public money, and the general progress of the colony. As this increase in value is given by the community, it follows that the humblest child has as much right to the benefit of such increased value as the most influential man in the colony. The existing system of local rating offers a premium to the non-improvement of land, while under the one now proposed a man would have the satis- faction of knowing that if he improved his land he would not be taxed for so doing, and conse- quently encouragement would be given to the expenditure of money and the employment of labour in erection of buildings, which was of benefit to the community. Now, Sir, reference has been made to Invercargill by the honour- able member for Riccarton. All the arguments that that honourable gentleman used to-night were used lately in connection with the opposi- tion to the proposal to bring into operation in the Town of Invercargill the system of rating on unimproved value, and I am glad to say they had little weight with the citizens, inasmuch as the proposal was carried in that city by a large majority. I am pleased to say that, although we had a great struggle, we succeeded in carrying that desirable measure of reform in that progressive town. Now, Sir, some time ago, as honourable members will recollect, when this question was first brought before the House, Sir Robert Stout was a very strong opponent of the proposal, and to support his arguments quoted largely from a statement that was prepared by the then Town Clerk of Invercargill (Mr. W. B. Scandrett), with the view of showing that if rating on unim- proved values was carried in towns the new system of taxation would be found to bear very oppressively on the poorer classes. Now, in connection with the discussion on the question that took place recently in Invercargill, Mr. Scandrett again submitted statements almost to the same effect as the first one. It went in the direction of leading people to believe that the poorer classes in the town, or small householders, would have to pay extra taxation, and that many large and valuable buildings in the town would have their taxation greatly reduced. But, Sir, after the matter had been gone into fully it was shown conclusively that if the proposal was brought into operation it would have the oppo- site effect. One block of buildings, situate in the Crescent, was specially referred to by him. They were very valuable buildings, and were of the nature referred to by the honourable member for Riccarton-loan companies' offices, merchants' offices, and banks, all in one block. These, it was alleged, would have to bear less taxation under this system of rating on the unimproved value; but it was actually proved conclusively siderably more taxation. An Hon. MEMBER .- Buildings are all exempt. Mr. HANAN .- True; but if you take the unimproved value of the land in the Crescent on which such buildings are erected, and the proposed rate-44d. in the pound-you will find that, as a result of the proposed system, more taxation will have to be paid. Personally, I shall have to bear increased taxation, but be- lieving as I do that the new system of rating is sound, just, and progressive in principle, and will promote the general advancement of the town and the better interests of the people as a whole, I do not mind paying a little additional taxation under the circumstances. And what did I find on making inquiries on the subject from some members of this House who represent towns in other parts of the colony where rating on unimproved value had been adopted ? They informed me, in reply, that the experience of the working of the Act in their district was that the small householders and the poorer class benefited by its operation. Now, reference has been made by some speakers to-night to the question whether the owner of an empty unimproved section should pay the same taxation as the owner of a section that is improved. In considering that point the view I take is that as a man receives so should he pay. If he receives the same amount of municipal benefits as his neighbour, why should he not pay the same amount of taxation, rent, or interest, as the case may be, for the amount of money expended by the municipal body in improving his property ? What do you find in regard to the owner of an unimproved section ? You find that he has the same muni- cipal service and the same benefits in respect to his land as the man who owns the improved section. Associated with and in front of the unimproved section there is the same amount of gaspipe, the same amount of street, the same amount of waterpipe, the same amount of pave- ment, and the same amount of drainage- work ; in fact, you find all the municipal conveniences opposite this unimproved section as are asso- ciated with and in front of the improved section. Therefore, if, say, £100 of municipal loan-money has been expended in putting municipal services and public improvements in front of the unim- proved section, why should that individual not pay the same amount of taxation or interest into the fund of interest for loan-moneys as the person who has had the same amount-$100 -- of municipal loan - money expended, and conse- quently the same municipal services or public improvements, in connection with his section, which has been built on and otherwise im- proved ? I say, therefore, if a man receives the same municipal service-let his section be improved or not - he should pay the same amount of money by way of taxation or rent for the benefits and service so conferred. So I say, if we have regard to the question of equity and of equal benefits and equal services, the owner of an unimproved section should pay the same as the owner of a section that is im- proved. Moreover, by this system of taxation 
<page:256>
sons who hold unimproved land for speculative purposes have had its value greatly increased without them doing anything to create such increased value. Such landowners do nothing to aid production. improvements, or progress, but actually retard the same in the country. A landlord might, indeed, hold land all his lifetime, but he would have received neither income nor produce from it unless a com- munity had existed for the one and tenants for the other. 1 hold that the owners of land- values which are the result of no exertion on the part of the owner, should contribute more than the owners of other forms of wealth which is the result of labour and enterprise. Now, Sir, I remember reading a speech of my honourable friend the member for Wellington City (Mr. Hutcheson) on this subject some time ago, in which he wisely said that an ounce of practice was worth a ton of theory. Now, what do we find has actually taken place where this Act has been brought into operation in other countries? Let us take Queensland, and the following is the recorded opinion of the Town Clerk of Brisbane after eight years' ex- perience of the working of this progressive system of rating in Queensland :- " I am inclined to think that the system of rating on the capital value of land irrespective of improvements does encourage the erection of buildings on vacant land, and it also tends to the erection of a better class of buildings. We have less difficulty in making the assessment, the capital value of the land being more readily ascertained than where improvements have to be taken into account." Then, again, what do we find in other parts of the world ?- and here I may remark that it is very interesting and instructive to note the very great strides this movement has been making all over the English-speaking world. I will ask the indulgence of the House here while I read some valuable quotations dealing with what has been done in other parts of the world in regard to this proposal :- "In British Columbia it is compulsory to rate land-values alone for local purposes. In Queensland, South Australia, and in Manitoba and other Canadian States, it is optional for Municipalities to rate either the property or the unimproved value of the land." In New South Wales I may state that a reso- lution demanding the optional exemption of improvements from rating was carried by a conference of 147 Municipalities as early as 1889. Again in 1898, at a conference of dele- gates representing a majority of the Munici -. palities of Western Australia, the following resolution was carried : -- " That the methods of determining valuations provided in the Local Government Act are not conducive to the advancement and prosperity of a municipality, and this conference recom- mends that the valuations be made on the current value of land, irrespective of any struc- tures thereon." A majority of Scottish boroughs, headed by the City of Glasgow, have petitioned Parliament Mr. Hanan of rating. In 1897, a municipal conference in London, representing 266 towns in the United Kingdom, passed a strong resolution in support of the proposal of rating on ground-values alone. Again in March, 1898, at another conference in London, representing fifty-seven rating autho- rities, the following resolutions were passed : - " (a) For the separate valuation and assess- ment of lands and improvements ; (b) for the as- sessment of the tax on the true value of the land, whether used, or let, or held idle by the owner, and not upon the income which the land may be yielding ; (c) for the collection of the tax from the occupier, with a statutory right of de- duction, as is the case in the income-tax. Schedule A ; and (d) for the assessment of land- values for local as well as for. Imperial pur- poses." The Daily News of the 29th March, 1898, re- ferring to the resolutions, observed that,- " It should by no means escape notice that the movement for the taxation of ground- values has received the powerful support of the Association of Municipal Corporations. At the annual meeting, apparently without opposition, the representatives of 266 towns in the United Kingdom, including all the county boroughs and all the non-county boroughs of over fifteen thousand inhabitants except one, declared that the growing burdens upon ratepayers made it urgent that some means should be provided by which owners of land, whether occupied or vacant, should contribute to local revenue. The Municipal Corporations in the United. Kingdom represented a very strong,"- And here I would call the attention of my honourable friend the member for Riccarton, whom we sometimes regard as, and who calls himself, a Liberal, to this significant part of that newspaper's report, which, continuing, states : - "- and perhaps the best conservative element in the country, and now they are found support- ing a measure which, when put forward by the progressives on the London County Council, was characterized as revolutionary and, at least, im- practicable. Yet the London County Council was only following the example of a great unionist Corporation, Glasgow; and now its policy is indorsed by all the important boroughs in the land. The inference is obvious. The demand that the owners of land shall be taxed for local improvements, from which they largely benefit, is now made by the whole of the large urban communities in Great Britain and Ire- land, and it cannot much longer be resisted. In Great Britain the rating of the unimproved value of land has now become the foremost political question. Men like Lord Rosebery, Lord Carrington, Lord Hobhouse, and Lord Compton are earnestly advocating it, as well as The last elec- most of the great newspapers. \--- tions in the London County Council turned on the question, and resulted in a large majority of its supporters being returned." Mr. MORRISON. - What are you quoting from ? Mr. HANAN .- I am quoting from a South 
<page:257>
the article which appeared in the London Daily News to which I have referred. Nearly all these quotations are based on the practical working of this Act, and, I think, are sufficient to convince honourable members opposed to this measure that in advocating a continuance of the present rating on the "annual to let or capital value" with its penalising effect on enterprise and improvements, they are upholding a system of taxation which is most pernicious in its charac- ter and in every respect a bar to the improve- ment, progress, and prosperity of the colony .. Every endeavour, I submit, should be made in the public interest to secure land being put to its best use. It was the freedom of appropria- tion and disposition of land which obtained in the Old Country which has led to the existence of a propertyless proletariat. Land-owning is nothing more than privilege-owning. All the arguments of the honourable member for Ric- carton used against this Bill are the arguments of those who support the property-tax. If I held opinions like the honourable gentleman on the subject of taxation I should at once move to bring again into operation that much-con- demned. and I say deservedly condemned, form of taxation the property-tax. I trust, Sir, that we shall never have that iniquitous tax re-en- acted in this colony ; and I hope, further, that we will to-night take a step in affirming a pro- gressive principle of taxation by which we shall remove for ever, so far as local rating is con- cerned, another pernicious system of taxation. If we do so we shall introduce into this colony a most important factor, which will promote in a marked degree the general progress of the country, and be, I am firmly convinced, in the   best interests of its intelligent and industrious people. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston). - I think the speech of the honourable member for Riccarton must have come rather as a surprise to mem- bers of the House, who were not at all aston- ished at the attitude taken up by the member for Hawke's Bay on this question, because it is consistent with the whole of his career, and I can fully understand how strongly he feels upon the question of levying taxation on the unimproved value. But those who have strongly supported the general system of taxa- tion on the unimproved value cannot possibly see any anomaly in applying such a system to local rating. The difference between the two is this : that the general taxation only touches people who are fairly well off, while local taxa- tion reaches everybody, and the very argument the honourable member for Riccarton used against the land-tax as levied at present-that those who have leases in perpetuity escape from that taxation-does not apply to local rating at all, because under the rating on unimproved value they pay exactly the same as any other occupier of land. For that reason alone, I think he should, as a matter of equity, be a strong supporter of it. Now, personally I do not think it is advisable to make the system compulsory throughout the colony. I think it would have been preferable if the VOL. CXVII .- 16. enlarging the scope of the system by leaving out the exemptions of special rates, water rates, et cetera, imposed in the Bill of 1896, and also by making the system of taking the poll simpler and easier than it is at present. If there were, say, a compulsory poll at the time of the election of members of local bodies on this system, and people could record their votes without inconvenience, then I feel certain the result would be that throughout the colony rating on unimproved value would obtain. A little over eighteen months ago, Senator Bucklin, from Colorado, in the United States, made a tour of the Australasian Colonies, and spent a considerable time in New Zealand studying this system of local rating. The result of his visit was that, in the first session of the Senate after he returned Home, he was able to carry a similar Act to our own through the Legislature, and it only remained to be im- posed after a poll of the whole State-not, as in our colony, of the local districts-upon that system had been taken. Now, I have no doubt that there it will obtain just as successfully as it has in parts of this colony. But, at the same time, there are people in this colony who use the same old stock arguments which have been used in this House time after time against the system of taxation which was inaugurated by the late Mr. Ballance, in 1891. Almost the exact words that were used by the honourable member for Riccarton you will find recorded in Hansard at that time. But, strange to say, the people who use those arguments do not say that the system will injure the wealthy man, and that it is going to benefit the small man. They tell us exactly the opposite : that it is going to benefit only the wealthy owner and that the small property-holder will suffer. What is the fact? That the most ardent supporters of the rating on unimproved value system are not the large property-owners at all, but are the small property-owners; and the peculiar thing is that they are so willing to com- mit what I may call taxation suicide, after the evils which have been so eloquently pointed out -. they will not believe they are going to suffer in the way predicted. And, as a matter of fact, it has not worked out in that way. The Borough of Palmerston North was the first district in the colony to put this system into operation. It was carried within a month or two of the Act being passed, and there has never been any question as to the fairness of that system. In that borough the only dissatisfaction has been that certain rates are exempted from the opera- tions of the Act ; and when you get your rate notice, with the comparison side by side show- ing the rates which are levied under the rating on unimproved value system and the rates levied on the capital value, you have as strong an argument as you can possibly get in favour of the system of rating on unimproved value. But where there is dissatisfaction with the system it is in connection with the valuations. The Valuation Department may be all very well for general taxation, but when it comes to local taxation it is not careful enough. There 
<page:258>
between the classes of land ; and that is one reason why I have always strongly advocated allowing the local bodies to make their own valuations, because they can get men personally acquainted with the locality, with the surround- ing circumstances, the quality of the land, and the real value of the improvements, and they are able to bring their valuations down to a very much finer point than the valuer who has no local knowledge, and who has a very large district to value over. I feel certain one of the greatest stumbling-blocks to the extension of this system of rating is faulty valuations. There would not be the slightest objection to it if it were not for that. But the argument about expensive buildings being exempted from taxation is the greatest fallacy in the world, when you remember that the rule is to erect expensive buildings only on valuable land. There are not many men foolish enough to spend €5,000 or £10,000 on building near a vast swamp, or in a large area of land of compara- tively little value. There may be one or two people who are foolish enough to do that in the colony, but they are the exceptions that prove the rule. As a rule, the best 10.0. buildings are always erected on the localities where land is most expensive, and it is the building very often that gives extra value to the unimproved value of the land, strange as that anomaly may seem, because the locality which has good buildings gains added value by attracting people to that locality. No matter how much is spent on a building, without the population no additional value is given to the land. Therefore it is a perfectly fair thing to encourage the erection of good buildings, the employment of labour, and do away with small unsightly buildings by relieving the owner of the greater burden of taxation ; because we know it is not the individual that pays, but the com- munity. The result in Palmerston has been to persuade the owners of waste land to sell their land for building purposes. It is a very satis- factory thing, when one purchases land to put a building upon, to know that you will not have to pay increased rates because you are going to erect a building, which was the case under the old system. I feel certain if the Bill were only to go so far as bringing all the rates under the system of rating on unimproved value, and if something were done to make the polls less expensive and easier for the people to utilise, you would get in every district in the colony rating on unimproved value. It is a good thing to see this system extending in the country districts. Only last year the Manawatu Road District carried the system, and in many other parts of the colony counties are bringing the system into force, and I feel certain, if the system is accompanied by a reasonable system of local valuation, it would obtain throughout the whole colony without the slightest necessity for the compulsory provisions of the Bill. Mr. ELL (Christchurch City). - The honour- able member for Riccarton was rather unfor- tunate in taking his illustrations from Christ- church and Sydenham, as in both these Mr. Pirani the proposed system. To show that it is de- sirable to go carefully into this question, and to find out how it does actually operate, before expressing an opinion on it, I would point out to the honourable member that with regard to the loss of rates on the big buildings which he has referred to, which so scared and frightened the small people of Sydenham - the big buildings that were used to such an extent by the Town Clerk and certain prominent Councillors to scare the Sydenham ratepayers- I will show him the loss on those fourteen big buildings. I took the value of every big build- ing, and, on the other hand, I took the value of thirty-two large properties in the borough held by rich people, and the thirty-two rich property-owners would more than make up for the loss on the big buildings. The owners would pay between them £220 more in rates. What about the poor man? The poor man in Sydenham is going to gain by it. I prepared a table, and I set in one column the value of the land, showing amounts from $25 to $1,000, and in the other column capital values from #25 to $1,000, showing the rate payable opposite each sum under the old and new systems. I had fifteen hundred copies of that slip printed, and I got a number of ratepayers to help me, and the night before the poll I had one of those slips placed in every householder's hands, and when the poll was declared it was found that we carried it by 353 votes against 193-a very substantial majority. Mr. SEDDON .- Give us a few illustrations from the table you have prepared. Put them on record. Mr. ELL .- I will give you some illustrations from Christchurch. An Hon. MEMBER .- What about the Gas- works ? Mr. ELL .- The Gas-works paid $29 less, the Albert Bond paid $31 less, and the Loan and Mercantile Building paid £32 less. Notwith- standing the loss on the big buildings, the smaller ratepayers will pay less than they did formerly. An Hon. MEMBER .- You say some properties pay more than they did under the old system. Mr. ELL .- Yes; the thirty-two properties I have referred to will pay between them $220 more rates. What I have stated is absolutely correct. If I had known this Bill was coming on to-night I would have been prepared with more information, and further illustrations of the effect of rating on the unimproved value : but when the Bill is in Committee I shall give honourable members further instances of how it has worked out in my district ; and I will show the House how the poor man is affected by this system. With regard to Linwood, another district that I carried by a very sub- stantial majority, I will give a few illustrations. One property, capital value £280, and unim- proved value #50 : that is only a small holding, an ordinary working-man's home. Under the present system it pays £1 1s. 10d., and under the new system 10s. 11d. Another instance : Capital value $205, and the un- 
<page:259>
property, the improvements being valued at $155. It pay 16s. under the present system, and will pay 10s. 11d. under the new system. Now, I will give two or three illustrations in one of the suburbs - in my own district, Spreydon. An Hon. MEMBER. - A sparsely populated dis- trict. Mr. ELL .- There is some of it pretty thickly populated. As an illustration of what will happen in Spreydon, I will take the case of a bootmaker. I know the man. He has a large family, and only earns from 7s. 6d. to &s. a day. He has devoted much care and time to improving his place, and has made it look very nice. The capital value is 9344; the unimproved value $80. Rates under present system $3 0s. 3d. ; new system. 15s. In another case, the capital value is $234, and the unim- proved value $60. Rates under present sys- tom. 91 7s. 5d .; under new system, 11s. 3d. The owner is a carrier in a small way. I will now give the case of a market-gardening lot of about two acres, with a house on it: The capital value is $400, and the unimproved value $200. Rates under the present system, $2 6s. lod. ; under new system, €1 17s. 6d. My next illustration is that of a small hold- ing of about two acres and a half. The owner keeps cows, and is a widow. The capital value is $360, and the unimproved value $200. Rates under present system, $2 2s. 1d. ; under new system, El 178. 6d. My last illustration is that of a carpenter, whose little property is valued at $200; unimproved value, $50. Rates under present system, ₺1 3s. 5d. ; new system, 9s. 4d. An Hon. MEMBER. - Are these town proper- ties ? Mr. ELL .- These are suburban properties, and the illustrations I have given show that a poor man is not going to be injured under this system. The honourable member for Hawke's Bay stated that we were letting off the man with the big mansion under this system, and the large landowner in the country. Captain RUSSELL. No; in the suburbs. Mr. ELL .- I will presently give a few illus- trations in connection with the City of Christ- church, where there are large blocks containing handsome buildings, and from which you can see how the poor man there comes out under this system. I will now refer to the district Mr. Lewis, the late member for Christchurch City. lived in. There are a lot of very fine homes in the district, which is also in the district represented by the honourable mem- ber for Riccarton, and I am going to show the honourable gentleman how it is going to affect his own constituency. I will take the case of a property valued at €125 capital value, with $100 of improvements on the land. This is a small home in the country. Under the present system that man pays 7s. 9d. ; under the new system, 2s. 1d. Here is another case : A property with €180 of capital value and $50 land value ; on the capital value he will pay 11s. 3d, and on the land only 4s. 3d. These be levied on the unimproved value, to bring in the same amount of revenue as collected on the capital value. Here is another case: A man with €175 worth of improvements, on land of the value of $120 ; under the present system it would pay 18s. 4d., and under the new system 10s. 3d. These illustrations will show how in the country districts, where there are some big buildings and some big houses, the small man, or the poor man, is not going to be injured. With regard to Christchurch, I know that it was not out of any feeling of enmity to me, or from any desire to do me any harm politically in my district, that the honourable member for Riccarton referred to Christchurch, but I will discuss his remarks in a kindly spirit. Well, with regard to Christchurch, as the honourable member for Riccarton knows, there are a lot of very fine buildings there. Now, to show that I have worked out my calculations according to the absolute facts, I got the rates levied on the annual value in 1898. I also got the annual value. I got the unimproved rateable value, and I have found that a rate of 4 d. in the pound on the unimproved value would produce to the City Council the same amount in revenue, within a few pounds, of what the rate in the pound on the annual value would produce. Now, how does it work out ? I must tell the honourable member for Riccar- ton that in High Street, Christchurch-I got the figures from the Land Valuation Depart- ment-there is land valued at #135 per foot. Compare this with the value in a poor district, and I take for illustration Aberdeen Street. a street 20 ft. wide, leading off Madras Street, containing a lot of small cottages occupied by working - men and their families. The land there is valued at from 17s. 6d. to £1 per foot, and, as I have said, in High Street it is valued at as high as €135 per foot. The annual values of the properties in Aberdeen Street are £12, €15, £16, $18, and the rates on the annual value respectively £1 9s. 9d., £1 17s. 1d., £1 19s. 8d., $2 4s. 7d. Now, what will be the rate on the land-value under this system which is going to be so injurious to the poor man ? Only 12s. and 13s. 9d. each section. Notwith- standing the fact that the rates are taken off all the huge blocks of buildings in Christchurch, that is how it will operate there. Mr. R. THOMPSON .- You do not say how you are going to make up the loss. Mr. ELL. -- Yes, I will show you how we make up the loss. We have in Christchurch a very large landowner who has grown rich by speculating in land. This man possesses, amongst other properties in the city, a corner section valued at $1,500, according to the Land Valuation Department. He is paying under the present system $9 Os. 5d. a year. The honourable member for Marsden asks how is the loss of rates by exempting big buildings to be made up? Under the new system this owner will pay $25 17s. 6d. This corner sec- tion has not even a decent fence round it, and it is fronted by one handsome block of build- ings, and at the side of it there is another 
<page:260>
man will not sell unless he gets a high price. An Hon. MEMBER .- Will he pay the same amount if he puts up a building on the pro- perty ? Mr. ELL .- Yes. I would not penalise the man who spends his money on improvements. He is a good colonist, a good citizen. I will now take a case of seven or eight shops bringing in a handsome rental. In this case under the present system that property pays £129 4s. 9d. ; under the new system it would pay £146 12s. 6d. You see there is an increase of the rates in that illustration, which goes to show where we will get the loss of revenue made up by taking the rates off the big buildings. I will now take a few illustrations from Conference Street. The honourable member will know where Con- ference Street is. The houses are occupied by clerks, artisans, and people in a poor condition of life. Well, now, Conference Street sections are 31 ft. by 112 ft., and are valued at £90. The rates on the land-value amount to £1 11s. On the other hand they are paying on the annual value £2 4s. 7d., $2 9s. 7d. £2 12s., and £8 9s. 5d. It will be seen again that the poor man is not going to be injured under the proposed system of rating. I will now take the richest bank in Christchurch, and show how the new system will operate. The unimproved value is $15,000, and the rates on the annual value €178 4s. 10d. The rates on the land-value would be #258 15s. That is the richest bank in Christchurch, and that shows where we are going to get the rates from,  Now, with and not out of the poor man. regard to what the people think of it, it is in operation in nine counties, six Road Board districts, one town district; and seventeen     boroughs-thirty-three in all; and at the poll it has only been rejected in three boroughs- the boroughs of Picton, Timaru, and Woolston. Only three out of the forty-six polls which have been taken have rejected it. Now, what is the voting in the districts where it has been accepted ? This bears out the Premier's state- ment that it has been accepted by ten to one. In the districts where it has been carried and is in operation, the voting was 6,000 in favour and 1,605 against. This shows that the feeling was very strong in favour of it, and I think we are perfectly justified in taking this as an inti- mation that the people desire to have it put into general operation without putting them to the expense and trouble of taking a poll in every district. We have had a fair indication from the people where these polls have been taken that they desire to have the Act in operation, and I am sure we are perfectly justified in put- ting it in operation by this Act, and so saving them the trouble of taking the votes. With my honourable friend the member for Palmers- ton, I quite agree that clause 20 should come out ; this system should apply to all rates. because the benefits I have shown with regard to Christchurch as affecting the poorer class of people would only be half secured if clause 20 of the principal Act remains in force, as in that case only one-half of the rates would be affected. Mr. Ell given by the honourable gentleman is extremely interesting, and I could place more value upon it if I had been satisfied with the answer the honourable gentleman gave to my interjection. I asked if he was quoting from actual experience of rating on the unimproved values, or whether they were estimates. His answer to me was that they were taken from the rate-book, and I assumed for the moment he meant by that that he was quoting from actual experience after the Act had been brought into operation. But I soon gathered from subsequent remarks that that was not so, and that they were all, or most of them, estimates. I came to that con- clusion because he went on to speak of cases in Halswell and the Borough of Christchurch, and in neither of these places has rating on the unimproved value been brought in. Therefore the instances the honourable gentleman has been putting before the House are estimates, and not actual facts. Now, I do not mean to say for one moment that there is not a great deal to be said for the rating on unimproved value. There are cases, and the honourable gentleman quoted one, where the rating on un- improved value is fair : I mean where you have an unoccupied and unimproved piece of land alongside other land that has been improved, the former being held for speculative purposes. In such a case, I say the rating on unimproved value is fair ; but there are other instances, and I will quote some of them later on, where rating on unimproved value is manifestly unfair. Just one instance, however, in favour of that. I will not adduce one of my own, but I will take an instance from the honourable member's speech itself. The honourable member said that there were fourteen large buildings in a borough -I do not know which borough. Mr. ELL-Sydenham. Mr. J. ALLEN .- Sydenham ; but the rating on unimproved value has not been carried in Sydenham. Mr. ELL .-- No. Mr. J. ALLEN .- Then, this is another esti- mate. What is the value of his numerous estimates? They may be correct or they may be incorrect. If the honourable member, after the coming into operation of the Act, had collected instances, they would have been valu- able, but we must take estimates for what they are worth ; and in face of the fact that the honourable member could have quoted actual experiences his estimates are not worth any- thing. An. Hon. MEMBER .- The experience of Inver- cargill is favourable. Mr. J. ALLEN .- I have not heard of that. The honourable member for Invercargill made a speech, but he did not give us a single in- stance. I shall come to the Borough of Inver- cargill presently, but I wish, before time is up, to make one other remark with regard to the honourable member's speech in respect to the statistics given in a return which he quoted. He is wrong in his figures, I am sorry to say. The poll has not been taken in forty-six dis- tricts. 
<page:261>
Mr. J. ALLEN .- Forty-six polls have not been taken ; forty-five have been taken ; but the honourable gentleman will find, if he studies the return, that in five instances the polls are duplicated-they were rejected in the first instance and taken again. Then, he also said the rating on unimproved value was only rejected in three boroughs. Why did he say in three boroughs? There are more than three cases of rejection. The facts are these : that in forty different districts polls have been taken. I do not mean to say that there are not more than forty polls, but in forty districts polls have been taken, and in thirty-three of these it was carried, and lost in seven. The number of votes recorded in the districts in which the polls were carried was 6,868 for the proposal, and 1,538 against, and in the districts in which the proposals were lost the voting was 875 for and 620 against. The total in both cases was 7,743 against 2,158. The whole point, how- ever, is this : the Bill desires to make rating on unimproved values compulsory, and this return is produced as an argument for making it compulsory ; but the return shows that in only forty districts has the attempt been made to bring this Act into force, and in only thirty-three of them was it carried. How many districts are there in New Zealand ? There are over eighty counties and nearly one hundred boroughs, and I am not counting Road Boards ; and because in thirty-three small dis- tricts, of which I shall have something to say later on, this Act has been brought into force,  that, forsooth, is said to be an argument for making this compulsory. Sir, this Bill is not a Bill upon which we are expressly invited to discuss the principle of rating on the unim. proved value. The Bill is a Bill to make rating on unimproved value compulsory all over New Zealand, and that is the point we have to con- sider in this second reading debate. Now, I maintain that so far as this return is con- cerned, and so far as our experience teaches us at the present time, there is not sufficient argument to induce us to call on all the local bodies to alter their present system of rating. Debate interrupted. The House adjourned at half-past ten o'clock p.m. # LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. Tuesday, 6th August, 1901. Third Reading-Cemeteries Bill-Ashburton County Council Empowering Bill -Woodville County Bill. The Hon. the SPEAKER took the chair at half-past two o'clock. PRAYERS. THIRD READING. Police Offences Bill. CEMETERIES BILL. A message was received from the House of Representatives transmitting for the considera- message from His Excellency the Governor in the Cemetery Trustees Validation and Appoint- ment Bill. On the question, That the amendments be agreed to, The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER said he did not think there need be any difficulty in regard to this amendment. When the Bill went through the Council they amplified it in the direction of making it possible for members of Road Boards to be trustees of cemeteries. County Councils stood on a footing of their own, and it was held that Road Boards were not on the same footing as County Councils and Town Boards of the ordinary class. The clause pro- posed by His Excellency the Governor was to meet clause 3 as originally printed, which dealt with the Rotorua Cemetery. The clause would now read : "It shall be lawful for the Governor to appoint the Rotorua Town Board as trustees of the Rotorua Cemetery." The Hon. Mr. McLEAN said he did not think it was usual for these amendments to be treated in this way, and he thought they should be put on the Order Paper. Members did not know what the amendments were. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER said he had no objection to the amendments going on the Order Paper, and being made an order of the day for Wednesday. Motion withdrawn, and amendments made an order of the day for Wednesday. # ASHBURTON COUNTY COUNCIL EM- POWERING BILL .. The Hon. Mr. TWOMEY. - I move the second reading of this Bill. It is a technical Bill extending the power of the County Council to make by-laws with respect to waterworks. It has passed the other House, and, as it will go to the Committee, I do not think it is neces- sary for me to say any more. Bill read the second time. WOODVILLE COUNTY BILL. The Hon. Mr. W. C. SMITH .- In moving the second reading of this Bill, I would point out to the Council that it is simply an at- tempt of the people in this part of the dis- trict to abolish the Road Boards and make one rating body instead of two. Meetings have been held in different parts of the dis- trict, and they have come to the conclusion that it is unnecessary now that there should be two local bodies rating over the district, with two lots of expenses - Clerks, adver- tising, and Inspectors: This Bill has passed the other Chamber, and has also passed the Local Bills Committee of the Council. The amendment put in contains amendments agreed to by the people themselves. It was omitted in the other Chamber, but has been put in by the Local Bills Committee with the consent of all the parties. I move the second reading of the Bill. Bill read the second time. The Council adjourned at ten minutes to three o'clock p.m.

Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said there was a matter he wanted to bring under the notice of He the House in order to get it rectified. found that, on the motion of Mr. Monk, it had been ordered, "That there be laid before this House a return showing, in detail, the expendi- ture by the Government in connection with the visit to New Zealand of His Royal Highness the Duke of Cornwall and York." Now, these words, "in detail," should be struck out, for the Government had agreed to the motion on that understanding. It appeared. also, that on the 4th July a similar return was ordered, on the motion of Mr. Barclay, in these terms :- "That there be laid before this House a return showing the cost in every department of,-(1) The visit of the Imperial troops : (2) the visit of the Indian troops ; (3) the visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York, so as to show in one return the total cost to the colony in every way of these three events." Mr. MONK (Waitemata) had not thought that his motion had been duplicated. Mr. SEDDON said the motions could go all right, but these two words, "in detail," would be treated as if struck out. And it was better done now in the House, lest he might be accused later on of not carrying out the orders of the House. In the House he understood it was agreed that these words should be eliminated from the motion. Mr. MASSEY did not think so. Mr. SEDDON said, Of course, he was not in the House at the time, but he understood from his colleague, Sir Joseph Ward, who was in the House, that that was the fact. He certainly knew that in Cabinet it was agreed that the return should be given with those two words "in detail " struck out of the motion. The motion would then be practically the same as Mr. Barclay's. Mr. MONK said there was no mention made of striking out those words. He could only say the House had passed it in that form. Mr. SPEAKER said if the honourable gentle- man was not satisfied with the return when it for the information he desired. # RHODES TRUST BILL. Mr. RHODES (Ellesmere), in moving the second reading of this Bill, said he did not think it necessary to enter into any lengthy ex- planation. The object of the Bill was to relieve certain lands in the vicinity-almost, one might say, within the boundaries of the City of Wel- lington-that had been tied up by the pro- visions of a will, so that it could be cut up. If honourable members would read the preamble they would see, on page 2, that the land could not in any case be disposed of by way of sale, and could only be leased for a term not exceed- ing two years. This Bill, if passed. would remove those restrictions. He might say that all the members of the family who were in New Zealand, and were interested, had given their consent to the Bill. The Supreme Court had also given its approval ; but the Bill was necessary because a few minors could not give consent. The interests of the beneficiaries were safeguarded by section 5, which provided " That all moneys to be received on any sale or sales shall be paid to the trustees, to be invested by them in accordance with the trusts of the said will." So that, whoever inherits under the Bill would not be any worse off : in fact. pro- bably would be in a better position than if the land was still tied up when they became pos- sessed of it. In fact, this Bill would merely give effect to the policy they all thought so de- sirable, the cutting up and settlement of land. He did not know if his remarks had been suft- ciently clear, but in reply would be glad to answer any questions. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) might say that he should support the passing of this measure. It in no way varied the trust, but it did give power to cut up the land and to let it, and to deal with it to greater advantage, and that in the interest of the beneficiaries and to the benefit of the locality in which the land was situated. He also knew, from what had been stated in the House the other day, that. owing to an alteration in the law by the adoption of rating on unimproved value, this very land would have to pay considerably more. It bad gone up from about $30 to about $280 ; and if it was not cut up, that, of course, meant that the rates would be very heavy upon land that was not producing. If the land was ent up. that would be to the advantage of the district. and to the advantage of those who were to benefit under the trust. He, therefore, thought the House ought to be unanimous in giving the opportunity to the trustees of doing what was asked. There were no objections, and. owing to the altered conditions, the proposal was reason- able, and he would strongly support the Bill. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) said he sympa- thized with the principle of this Bill, seeing that its object was the cutting up of a large landed property contiguous to a populous city ; but he had hoped the honourable member, in introducing the Bill, would have given some reasons why specific legislation was required. 
<page:263>
cation might be made to the Supreme Court under section 3, which, so far as he knew, would effect all the purposes contemplated by this measure, provided the parties interested consented, with the safeguard that the sale would have to be approved by a Judge of the Supreme Court. Now, he maintained that the honourable member ought to have stated to them whether any application had been made to the Court under section 3 of "The Settled Land Act, 1886." Section 3 of that Act was as follows :- " A tenant for life, with the consent of the Court, may sell the settled land or any part thereof, or any easement, right, or privilege of any kind over or in relation to the same." An application could be made to the Supreme Court, and the evidence would have to be sub- mitted to a Judge, and, if a Judge were satisfied that it was in the best interests of the parties, and the public, the sale of the land could be ordered. But there was no recital in this Bill that such an application had been made, and to show why the statute law of the land should not be availed of. He could not understand the position, and the honourable member should explain why it was necessary to require a special statute in the face of the existence of the Settled Land Act. With the very brief opening of the honourable member, no one in the House, with, perhaps, the exception of the Premier, who had probably gone into the matter, understood the necessity for the Bill. Mr. SEDDON .- The matter has been before the Court. Mr. NAPIER said, That fact was not stated in the Bill. Then, if the Court had declined the application they should know why it had de- clined it. There was an important principle involved in this Bill-namely, that of utterly depriving a testator of the right to say how his land should be regulated after his death. He was not in favour of the dead hand as applied to landed estates; but still there was this principle in the Bill, which the Legislature might or might not adopt-namely, the taking away the right of testamentary disposition in this particular case. Was that what the honourable member wished to do? They ought to be informed, further, whether all interested parties were consenting to the general law of the country being interfered with in this patch-work manner. Were all the beneficiaries under the will agreeable to the proposals in this Bill? If it was desired that no person should have the right by his will to say how his estate should be dealt with after his death, let it so be declared. But there should be a general law. Why should a poor person be deprived of the right to have a similar privilege to that which this Bill conferred on wealthy people - the right to deprive the testator of any control of the pro- perty after he has passed away, and the right to override the wishes of beneficiaries? The testator in this particular instance clearly defined what his wishes were in regard to this property, and the Legislature, considering that stringent powers possessed by testators, passed the Act to enable a Judge of the Supreme Court to allow settled land to be sold. And honourable members could see that that Act safeguarded the interests of all persons benefited under the provisions of a will, because the Judge to whom an application was made would investi- gate the matter in a calm and impartial way, and would have the benefit of sworn evidence before him. But they had no evidence before them in this particular case. The honourable gentleman merely said that there was a large property contiguous to the City of Wellington that they would all admit it was desirable that it should be cut up, and that they should therefore let it be cut up. The extracts from the will referred to in the Bill clearly showed the intention of the testator ; but he did not see any recital to the effect that the present legal powers had been exhausted. In principle he was not opposed to the Bill, and he did not wish at this stage to take the responsibility of moving that it be referred back to the Committee ; but it had provisions of an extraordinary character, and they had had no explanation why special legislation was required. He would like to see the estate cut up, and hundreds of smiling home- steads on it in place of one ; but he looked with jealousy on all private Bills which had for their object to override the will of testators without the consent of all the beneficiaries. The general law appeared to work satisfactorily ; he- knew hundreds of instances where applications had been made to the Supreme Court, and had never known one to be refused where evidence had been supplied that it was to the interest of the parties that a sale should take place. He trusted the honourable gentleman would give the House some further explanation on the matter in the course of his reply, and particularly if the guardians of the minors interested in the pro- perty objected to the proposed sale. Mr. PALMER (Ohinemuri) thought the honourable member for Auckland City had raised a storm in a teapot. There was nothing in the Bill to raise a storm about, the Bill was simple, and one the House ought to pass. Who had any interest in the matter? Only the beneficiaries themselves, and if they were all agreeble why should not the Bill pass? An Hon. MEMBER .- It does not say they are all agreeable. Mr. PALMER said, Of course there were minors, but evidently they were agreeable ; and those who had charge of the minors surely ought to have some say in the matter. The honourable member for Auckland City (Mr. Napier) had complained that this was altering the wishes and directions of a testator ; but how often was this thing done in the Supreme Court ? The Bill showed that it was only in consequence of a technicality that it could not be done in this He understood, also, that the Supreme case. Court recommended that this course should be taken, which, if it had been an improper course, the Court would not have made such a recom- mendation. The honourable gentleman, Mr. Napier, said there was no evidence that the 
<page:264>
able gentleman who introduced this Bill to that effect, which was quite enough for him, and should be for the House. When they had the assurance of that honourable gentleman (Mr. Rhodes) that this course had been recommended by the Supreme Court, they should not hesitate to at once give effect to the Judge's suggestion. As to the honourable member's (Mr. Napier's) suggestion that they were treating this Bill too lightly, why if Mr. Napier knew the Standing Orders of this House he would know that a Select Committee for private Bills was set up every session, and when a Bill was before that Select Committee it was submitted to the most searching inquiry. The Bill had been before a Committee set up by another House for inquiry into these class Bills, and it would be before another such Committee set up by this House, and he thought nothing more need be said about it. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) said the honourable member for Auckland City seemed to have been arguing that they should not pass the Bill because the same powers as the Bill provided for had already been given to the Supreme Court. Mr. NAPIER .- Except in the case of the minors. Mr. HERRIES said that was the reason why legislation was necessary. If the honourable gentleman would look at the end of the pre- amble he would see, "Whereas the objects of this Act are not attainable otherwise than by legislation." That being the case, this Bill  proposes to do by legislation exactly the same thing as the section of the statute quoted by the honourable member (Mr. Napier). If, therefore, he approved of the statute, why not     approve of the Bill? This is also the same principle as the law in force in the Old Country, known as Lord Cairns's Act, by which settled lands could be diverted from the in- tention of the man who settled them. An Hon. MEMBER .- The guardians of the minors must consent. Mr. HERRIES said that was the reason this legislation was brought in. At any rate, the measure had to go before the Committee, and, as that Committee would investigate the whole position, he submitted that if honourable mem- bers wished to take any objection to the Bill they should do so when the Bill came back from that Committee. There was one point to which he would like to draw the attention of the Committee which would be set up to consider the Bill. It seemed to him there was no provision in section 5 for any expense of The whole of the cutting up the estate. proceeds had to go to the trustees, to be kept in the terms of the trust ; but he thought only the net proceeds should go to the trustees, and a certain amount should be allowed in the Bill for the expenses of advertising and other matters which would arise during the sale of the estate. Mr. RHODES (Ellesmere) said, If the honour- able member for Auckland City (Mr. Napier) had Mr. Palmer private Bills, and he would not then have com- mitted the error of stating that he would move an amendment when the Bill was in Committee. He would have known that private Bills were referred to a Select Committee, and that they were not dealt with in Committee of the House. He would have known, too, that a private Bill did not pass through the House without in- vestigation. The investigation before the Select Committee was a very thorough investigation indeed. With regard to the objection of the honourable member, that the Bill ought to have cited in the preamble the necessity for the introduction of the Bill, he thought he stated in his opening remarks that the reason the Bill had been brought forward was that certain minors in the case could not give their consent. Mr. NAPIER asked why the guardians of the minors did not consent ? Mr. RHODES said, As far as that went, he might say the Bill was introduced on the sug- gestion of a Judge of the Supreme Court, and the Court had given its approval. The consent of the guardians of the minors would not have been sufficient. Had that consent been suffi- cient there would have been no necessity for putting this Bill through Parliament, and the Judge would not have suggested such a course. As for the objection raised by the honourable member for the Bay of Plenty, he had put the point to the solicitors who had the Bill in hand -Messrs. Moorhouse and Hadfield-and was informed by them that such provision was made under section 3, which said that the powers of sale and leasing should be under "The Leases and Sales of Settled Estates Act, 1865." If the matter were not clear, objection could be taken when the Bill was being investi- gated by the Select Committee. Bill read a second time. # CEMETERY TRUSTEES VALIDATION AND APPOINTMENT BILL. A message was received from His Excellency the Governor transmitting the following new clause in substitution for clause 3 of the Bill : "It shall be lawful for the Governor to appoint the Rotorua Town Council as the trus- tees of the Rotorua Cemetery." Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- I move, That the amendment be agreed to. We find that the land was vested in the Council, but we did not give it power to administer. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) .- I would like to ask whether the Premier intends to ap- point them trustees. Mr. SEDDON .- Yes. Motion agreed to. COAL-MINES: REPORT OF ROYAL COM- MISSION. Mr. McGOWAN ( Minister of Mines) brought up the report of the Roval Commission on Coal-mines, and moved, That it do lie on the table, and be printed. He was unable to lay the evidence taken before the Commission on the table, as it was not yet printed. 
<page:265>
important evidence that was proposed to be sent to the Royal Commission in regard to this matter. Mr. SEDDON asked, Why not do it when the Minister brought down the evidence, which had to be brought down in another paper? These statements could then be placed with the evidence. Mr. GUINNESS said it would perhaps save him taking up the time of the House if, by permission of the House, he was allowed to lay these statements on the table with the report, so that they might be printed as a supple- mentary paper to the evidence. This document contained the evidence of a large number of miners who worked in the Wallsend Mine. They had read in the Press that Mr. Martin Kennedy and another gentleman gave evidence that no coal was to be found in the Wallsend Mine. These workmen wished to have placed on record side by side with that evidence their testimony as to the extent and quality of the coal left in the mine when it was shut down by the company which held the mine. Mr. SEDDON .- Is that taken upon oath ? Mr. GUINNESS said, No, but it was signed. He was sure it made no difference whether a person gave evidence upon oath or not. How- ever, he took it that a very great injustice had been done to the Wallsend Coal-mine in that district by the evidence which was recorded by the Commission at Wellington. The people in the district where the coal-mines exist had no opportunity of cross-examining these witnesses  or of knowing exactly what they said; but immediately they saw it reported in the papers that evidence had been given by these persons, who were interested in the Westport and Grey Valley Coal Companies, to the effect that no coal existed in that mine, they immediately wrote their testimony, as contained in this document, and sent it to the Commission. He was in- formed by the Chairman of the Commission that this document was received a few days after the report was sent to the Government, so he could only take this opportunity of read- ing it, and placing it on record in this way. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) asked if the evidence taken by the Coal-mines Commission was going to be laid on the table. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Mines) said, Yes; the only reason it had not been laid on the table with the report was that there had been delay in printing it. Motion, to lay the report on the table and to print it, agreed to. Mr. GUINNESS (Grey) said he would move, That this statement, which was addressed to the Royal Commission in connection with their report, should now be laid on the table, and be printed. He only wished to draw attention to the following paragraphs in the document :- " We, the undersigned coal-miners, having been employed in the Wallsend Colliery, beg most respectfully to state that we have seen certain statements re the Wallsend Mine, made by Mr. Martin Kennedy and others, to the | ber for the Grey spoke, it seemed to him that that ' the seam thins out on the east side,' and that ' the mine is fault-bound to the west.' To most of these statements we give an emphatic denial. We have looked up the plans published by the Mines Department, as per report on the coalfields of the Grey Valley, by Messrs. H. A. Gordon, F.G.S., Inspecting Engineer, A. McKay, F.G.S., Mining Geologist, and N. D. Cochrane, Inspector of Mines, to the Hon. A. J. Cadman, Minister of Mines, in 1893, and, as we are quite familiar with the workings of the above colliery, these plans are practically correct. We have laid these plans before a qualified surveyor, who has supplied us with an estimate of coal in sight, amounting to 1,250,000 tons. This, we think, is under rather than over the amount. As for quality, the average is equal to any ever produced in the district, and some patches equal to any ever produced in the colony. No attempt has been made to prospect beyond the western fault. The eastern level has been driven a dis- tance of some 16 chains, and the coal at the face was 14 ft. high when the mine ceased work. During the period of over three years, when the mine was in active operation, we were all the time in solid workings. No pillar coal has been taken out. The dip when the mine ceased operations was driven for some 20 chains; good coal for the whole of that distance, and no bords worked ; in position to start at least thirty bords, giving room for 120 miners double-shifted (usual method). Re the stony or dirty quality : During the period this colliery was in active operation the total out- put was 205,539 tons. The quantity of stone or dirt picked out is still lying at the site where the coal was screened, and it could be put into two ordinary railway-trucks. At the Brunner Colliery there is as much as 30 cwt. of stone picked out of an ordinary railway-truck of coal, which will carry some 5 tons. Hence, give Wallsend coal the same method of screening as adopted at Brunner, and they will leave the colliery equal as to stone or dirt. We are of opinion this mine is a most valuable property, as it is close to the Grey-Brunner Railway, and only seven miles from the Port of Greymouth, and in the centre of a large coal-bearing dis- trict." That was the principal part he wished to call attention to. The rest of the document would speak for itself when it was laid on the table and was printed. Captain RUSSELL (Hawke's Bay) hoped the House would not allow this paper, which was a purely ex parte statement, to be laid on the table. If every person who had a grievance as to the nature of the evidence given before a Roval Commission was to be allowed at a sub- sequent date to write a report, which might or might not be absolutely inaccurate, and if such a statement was to be printed by order of the House as part of the proceedings of the Com- mission, then there was no use in setting up Commissions at all. As the honourable mem- 
<page:266>
which was made as far back as 1893. It was a report made to the Minister of Mines of that date, and referred to what the position of some mine was eight years ago ; and, in the case of country which was as faulty as the West Coast country was reported to be, it might be quite possible that the conditions were now absolutely and entirely changed. Mr. GUINNESS said he might be allowed to explain that the honourable member evidently misunderstood the facts in this matter. This particular mine was shut down before 1893, and nothing had been done to it since. Captain RUSSELL said, Of course, it was possible that he did not grasp all the facts of the position. But at the same time he did say that the principle of allowing state- ments to come in after reports had been presented, and such statements to be taken as authoritative, when the persons making them had not been subjected to cross-examination, was most improper. They had reports and opinions forwarded to the Federation Commis- sion to show that certain persons disagreed with the evidence given by other people, but on every such occasion the Commission had decided that, if these persons were not prepared themselves to come before the Commission and have their statements subjected to cross-exami- nation and inquired into by other persons who knew the facts, these statements of theirs could not be received. They were free to come before the Commission and make their statements there. He thought it would be extremely wrong if, by a decision of the House, they  were tacitly to assent to an er parte statement having the same authority as statements made in open inquiry before the Commission. He hoped the House would not agree to that.     Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) altogether dissented from the opinions expressed by the ex-leader of the Opposition. In limine the very argument of the honourable gentleman, that the persons who signed this document had not submitted themselves for cross-examination, was met by the statement of the honourable member for the Grey, who complained that the persons who gave evidence before the Commis- sion were not subjected to cross-examination. The cases were exactly on all-fours. His opinion was that the statements contained in this paper should be treated as the honourable gentleman said they ought to be treated, as purely er parte. To that extent they were of so much value and no more. The honourable gentleman went further than that, and he said, " What right had persons to express opinions now who were afraid to appear before the Com- mission ?" He (Mr. Fisher) had in his mind the course of procedure adopted by the Federation Commission : were the persons who did not appear before that Commission afraid to appear ? They were not afraid to appear, but. as they were not invited, they did not care to impertinently obtrude themselves upon the meetings of the Commission. They had no opportunity of appearing. Persons holding certain opinions were invited to appear ; but Captain Russell present time-more might be said about it on a future occasion. They had noticed from the proceedings of that Commission how the evi- dence was-well, they must not say carefully selected, because that would perhaps be going too far. But it was not exceeding the bounds of prudence to inform the honourable gentleman that there were strong feelings abroad in regard to the proceedings of that Commission, and he would venture to say that those feelings had been much more strongly expressed than was anything the honourable gentleman had said in reference to the proposal to admit this statement in opposition to the findings of the Coal Commission. The honourable gentle- man's objections were altogether untenable. If this statement was ex parte, what fear need there be in giving publicity to an ex parte statement ? It was valuable to that extent and no more. He certainly thought that persons so intimately acquainted with the whole question as these gentlemen who had signed this statement should have some op- portunity to express the opinions they held in regard to what undoubtedly was a very large question as affecting the citizens of the colony. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Mines) said he might perhaps throw a little light on the sub- ject. The position was, he thought. as fol- lows: A Commission had been appointed to take evidence regarding the working of the coal-mines in the colony. It visited all the important coal centres North and South, and took evidence in each place. The position of the present applicants was that they had evi- dently seen some of the evidence as published in reports of the proceedings of the Commission and had sent a statement, and he had been asked if he would include it in the Commission. He had no power to do any such thing. The position the honourable gentleman took up with regard to the paper, was that it should be included with the evidence taken before the Commission. He thought that would be irre- gular ; but he had no objection to the public knowing all about the matter. But all parties had had an opportunity of giving evidence, and this was a statement made by certain people after seeing some of the evidence, in a manner rebutting that evidence, he presumed. The Commission having closed their sittings, there was no power to include this or have it printed with the report. He had no objection to the whole statement being printed and issued if the House wished ; but he submitted it could not form part of the report or evidence before the Commission. Mr. FLATMAN (Geraldine) was glad to hear the Minister had no objection to this paper being laid on the table and printed. He thought it should be. He understood there was no evidence taken in the Brunner district as to the quantity or quality of coal in the Wallsend Mine. An Hon. MEMBER .- Yes, there was. Mr. FLATMAN .- Well, if the honourable member for Caversham would tell him when that evidence was taken he would be much 
<page:267>
case. He had it on very good authority from people in the district, that no evidence had been taken; and it was said none of the pillars had been removed in the mine, and that there were millions of tons of coal yet remaining in the mine. It was only right this document, con- taining the evidence of the miners interested, should be attached to the report ; and if the honourable member for the Grey could see his way to have it attested by the petitioners it might give the statement more weight. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said he did not think any member of the House knew more about the Wallsend Mine than he did. The closing of that mine had always been a mystery to the people on the West Coast, and there could be no doubt the sale to another company which had another mine to work had something to do with it. It had always been known amongst the miners that, although one part of the mine was somewhat faulty, there was any amount of coal. This was what the men in their petition said :- " The dip when the mine ceased operations was driven some 20 chains ; good coal for the whole of that distance, and no bords worked ; in position to start at least thirty bords, giving room for 120 miners double-shifted (usual method)." The report of the evidence taken in 11.30. Wellington was so diametrically op- posed to what these miners alleged to be cor- rect that they endeavoured, in the only way  they could, to be heard, and that was by send- ing a letter to the Commission and asking the Commission that it be put in as evidence. All Commissions did that, and they found in the Federation Commission's report opinions of various gentlemen which had been sent in by letter. Mr. MASSEY .- They went before the Com- mission. Mr. SEDDON said, Yes; but what was the difference? If the Commission had had the opportunity of considering this letter, probably it would have treated it in the same way, and it would have been embodied in the evidence they had taken. Captain RUSSELL .- The Federation Com- mission embodied no letters in their evidence. Mr. SEDDON said, No; but they formed part of the proceedings, and were embodied in the records. This letter could not be received in time, but he could assure honourable mem- bers that the names he found appended to the letter -the first name was that of Robert Russell, who was Mayor of Brunner, and he knew nearly every name that was on the letter, and he believed that those men would be as careful in the matter of putting their names to a document as any member of that House. He spoke from personal knowledge of the men. It was unusual for separate communications to be laid on the table of the House, but this was not an ordinary communication. An Hon. MEMBER .- Do you speak for the lot ? Mr. SEDDON said he knew nearly the whole of them ; and he might say, from his own per- said he knew to be correct. At any rate, it was an unusual circumstance, and the honour- able member for Hawke's Bay was quite right to call attention to it, because members would demur to ordinary communications received by members being laid on the table of the House. The circumstances in this case were special. This letter could not reach the Commission, for, he presumed, the Commission had ceased sitting, and they only asked that some oppor- tunity should be given them. After this had been laid on the table, he would ask that it be referred to the Mines Committee, who would get hold of these men and sift the question as to the closing of these mines, so that they might know once and for all if the public estate was sacrificed, as he believed it undoubtedly was. He would move, after this had been laid on the table, that it and the report of the Royal Commission, if deemed necessary, be also referred to the Mines Committee. ' Mr. GUINNESS (Grey) would like to say a few words in reply to what had been stated by the honourable member for Hawke's Bay, who seemed to say that it was a worthless paper, because the evidence had not been given on oath and the witnesses had not been subjected to cross-examination. The honourable gentle- man had said it appeared to him the Commis- sion had sat in the district, and that the people were afraid to submit themselves to cross- examination. Well, if the honourable gentle- man would look at the names on the petition he would see that the first one was " Russell," and must admit that no one of the name of Russell was likely to be afraid of cross-examina- tion : and the other names would also suggest the same conclusion. When the Commission sat in the district no questions were asked as to why this mine had been shut down, but when the Commission returned to Wellington it examined Mr. Martin Kennedy, a part share- holder, and also Mr. Joachim, the general manager of the Westport Coal Company, which also had a share in this mine, and which com- pany, as honourable members knew, owned the whole of the mines in the Westport district. Now, at this time they were working the mines of the adjoining districts of Grey- mouth and Westport, and for some un- known reason, as the Premier had told them, -- the people of the district never knew why- that mine was shut down. Then, when the Commission got to Wellington the gentlemen named came before them and said that the mine was faulty, that the coal was filled with stones, and that the result was such as not to warrant them going on with the work of the mine. When this evidence was telegraphed to the papers on the West Coast, Mr. Russell, the present Mayor of Brunnerton, who had been one of the overseers in the mine, and others, saw that the statements were incorrect and had been made under some misappre- hension, and they consequently resolved to send this document to the Commissioners. The Royal Commissioners unfortunately had by this time closed their sittings and sent in 
<page:268>
tioners to wait upon the Royal Commissioners and to get the document from the Chairman. This he had done, and that was how the docu- ment had come into his possession. He simply asked the House to lay the document on the table side by side with the evidence and report of the Commission, as the persons who had said the mine was faulty and the coal stony had never been down the mine, which was 600 ft. or 700 ft. deep when it closed down. The docu- ment presented gave the evidence of men who had worked in the mine, and who could speak of what they had seen regarding its condition. When this evidence was considered, honour- able members would be able to tell whether it was in accordance with what the gentlemen mentioned had told the Commission was the cause of the closing-down of the mine, or whether it had been closed down for some ul- terior object. He hoped this document would be received by the House and printed. Motion agreed to, and document referred to the Goldfields and Mines Committee for con- sideration. JOHN FALCONER AND OTHERS. Mr. PALMER (Ohinemuri) brought up the report of the Goldfields and Mines Committee on the petition of John Falconer and others, to the effect that the said petition be referred to the Government, with an expression of opinion that, in view of the decision of his Honour Mr. Justice Williams that there is no appeal from the judgment of the Commissioner of Crown Lands with respect to mining privileges, the law should be altered to permit of such appeals being made, and moved, That the report lie on the table, and be referred to the Government for consideration. Mr. McNAB (Mataura) hoped that the result of this petition would be that the Government would take this matter into their serious con- sideration. He did not think it was the inten- tion of the House, when it gave power to the Commissioner of Crown Lands to grant certain mining privileges, that the position of the Commissioner should be more powerful than the position of the Warden. It had, unfortu- nately for some people, been ascertained by the decision of Mr. Justice Williams that when these mining privileges were granted by Com- missioners of Crown Lands there was no appeal from them, as there was in the case of Wardens' grants. This had put these mining privileges in a very peculiar position indeed, and the petition which was presented to the House asked for, and the report recommended, that legislation be passed to give a right of appeal from the decision of the Commissioner of Crown Lands. He hoped the Minister of Mines, who was fully conversant with this case, would, when he was introducing a Bill dealing with the amendments to the mining law, put the Commissioners of Crown Lands in the same position as the Warden in granting mining privileges -- or, better still, that jurisdiction should be taken out of the hands of the Com- Mr. Guinness Wardens. Motion agreed to. WELLINGTON CITY RECREATION- GROUND BILL. Mr. HUTCHESON (Wellington City). - I have here the memorandum of agreement be- tween the Mayor and City Council of Welling- ton on the one part, and Messrs. Crawford Brothers on the other, containing the condi- tions of sale for the Miramar Estate. This is the paper asked for by the Minister for Public Works when I had the Wellington City Recrea- tion - ground Bill before the House. I have much pleasure in moving, That this document do lie on the table, and be printed. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) .- Of course, there can be no objection to the paper being laid on the table for the information of members of the House ; but this may fairly be said, that this contract, or compact, or whatever it may be called, ought to have been placed before the citizens as a whole before the Bill relating to the purchase of Miramar was introduced to this House. Here, at nearly the last stage of the Bill, the contract is laid on the table of the House. Well, so far as the citizens of Wel- lington are concerned, it might as well not be laid on the table at all, for there is now no time for them to interpose, even should they have any very strong objection to the terms of the contract itself. I observe from the news- papers that a public meeting of the burgesses of the city is to be held to consider the whole question of the proposed purchase of Miramar by the Corporation of Wellington, but it is impossible for them, with the short time now at their disposal, to thoroughly consider the contents of this contract. Of course, even at this late hour, it is better that the terms of the contract should be laid bare, so that its purpose and effect may be fully considered before the Bill passes through Committee. So far as the general body of the burgesses is con- cerned, it is too late, for any useful or effective purpose, to place the contract on the table of the House now. This is the step that ought to have been taken at the initial stage of the pro- posed purchase on behalf of the city. The con- tents of the contract should have been disclosed at some meeting of the City Council or at some public meeting of the burgesses. I will now endeavour to get a copy of the contract, and will produce it at the public meeting which, I understand, is to be held on Wednes- day, so that it may be seen if there is any- thing in it injurious to the interests of the citizens of Wellington. The people themselves ought to be fully seized of all the facts-in fact, the production of the contract at this late hour is itself a justification for the request which perhaps may be made for the further postpon- ing of the Bill, in order that the citizens may have time to analyse not only the contents of this contract, but the whole purpose and aim of the Bill. As I said on the motion for the second reading of the Bill, the people of this city have not had time to consider this proposal in all its 
<page:269>
sails of the opponents of this scheme to produce the contract at the eleventh hour, when there is, in reality, no time for dissecting its terms. Although I am a burgess of this city I have never seen the contract, and I undertake to say that no burgess outside of that select circle of persons who are interested in pushing this pur- chase to a conclusion has seen that contract. It ought to have been open to public inspec- tion by the citizens of Wellington, who are the persons most interested in the proposal ; but no such opportunity has been given them. The fact of laying the contract upon the table at this stage places the opponents of the scheme in no stronger position. As a matter of fact, it rather weakens their position. It certainly can be said that the contract is now on the table ; but who of the burgesses has seen it, or who understands its contents? As I have already said, no burgess, except the select few, has the faintest conception of what is embodied in the contract. I myself, as representing this city, and as a burgess of thirty-one years' standing, ought to have known the contents of that secret contract between the vendors of the estate and the Corporation. I say that no such opportunity has been afforded the people, and on that ground, if on that ground alone, they have a legitimate ground for delaying the passage of this Bill. Mr. FIELD (Otaki) .- I would like to ask the honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Hutcheson) whether this is the original contract that he has put on the table, or whether it is a true copy of the contract. Mr. HUTCHESON .- It is a checked copy of the whole contract. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- I think the House will be pleased to have had the opportunity of inspecting this contract-agreement, and I think it should be printed and circulated. Certainly the people of the City of Wellington have a per- fect right to have this contract placed in their hands. so that they shall know every detail of it. It would appear to me to be unreasonable to ask the people either to vote on the proposal or to ask Parliament to pass a Bill practically vali- dating the transaction in anticipation of the approval of both Parliament and the ratepavers of the city. I question whether a parallel case could be found in the colony, where a local body takes the option of a purchase, and, having secured the option proceeds to take parliamentary authority to carry out the pur- chase and after that proposes to take a poH of the ratepayers. It seems to me to be com- mencing at the wrong end. Why the option should be taken, and why they should wish to force the situation into concrete form by having such a contract as this, I cannot understand. Plainly put, the contract is for $75,000. There is at once to be paid $10,000, which is secured on mortgage at present ; and the balance is to be paid about the year 1905. At that time the sellers have the right to remove everything on the land, which, of course, does not amount to much-about £1,500, according to the schedule. But, as the contract is to be laid on the table, in respect to this property, when it was offered previously at a much lower price, and I would also like to have evidence to show how this property has jumped up from the price at which it was offered a short time ago to the $75,000. It would be interesting to the House, in view of the fact that you are practically legislating for the purchase at $75,000, if this matter was referred to a Committee, which could obtain the land-tax value and the valuation of the pro- perty. I would rather see in your legislation a provision that there shall be no such contract and no such purchase ; but that if the local body wants to take the property they can take it as other properties are taken, under provisions such as are found in the Land for Settlements Act, so that some Court may decide the price. I say that is fair to all concerned, and would remove all suspicion. I have nothing to say on the merits of the case at all. In a large city like Wellington, growing as it is, and looking to the future, there ought to be some provision made for lands for recreation purposes. The city is being gradually hemmed and wedged in, and there is a necessity for doing something, and the longer you leave it the worse it becomes ; but the fact of having such a contract as this, tying the city to buy at a price, is wrong, and I say the Mayor had no right to sign such a document, and the Council had no right to commit the city to such a contract, until some authority had been given to them by the ratepayers. There was not sufficient warrant, in 12.0. my opinion, for entering into a con- tract of this kind; but, having been entered into, we have it now before us, and my own way of dealing with this business is to leave it to the people of Wellington and to the discre- tion of their representatives; but we have no right to bind them to give a price such as this for a given property. If the estate is to be taken for the public, then I say you ought to give open powers to take it, and to see that this is so safeguarded that only the real value is paid for it. That is all I ask for, and it is what I think the House ought to insist upon. I am very pleased that the contract has been laid on the table. Mr. HUTCHESON (Wellington City). - This contract is only the right of refusal within a certain specified time-namely, two months after the close of this session. And the Bill provides for the alternative scheme of taking the land under the Public Works Act ; but the Premier was quite in error when he stated the amount offered for the land was $25,000. It was nothing like it. Mr. SEDDON .- I never mentioned any such sum. Mr. HUTCHESON .- The original proposer of the scheme, Mr. H. D. Bell, says, " I in- tended to offer $50.000, and if that was refused I meant to go under the Public Works Act." But that was years ago, prior to the expendi- ture of very large sums of money on heavy cuttings, roadings, wharves, and all sorts of ad- junets to the property, thereby enhancing its value. Now, the fact of this contract being in 
<page:270>
Parliament led the Premier to suggest that it is committing the citizens to something -- Mr. SEDDON .- It helps to fix the price at $75,000. Mr. HUTCHESON .- That is the point I wish to meet the Premier on. If the intending purchasers did not fix the maximum price that they were prepared to pay before asking the public sanction to the purchase, what chance would they have of treating with the owners of the property after a poll had been taken and the public had sanctioned the taking of the land ? I say that it would prejudice the best interests of the citizens entirely to disclose the provisions of this contract before having sub- mitted the Bill to Parliament. The citizens' interests are absolutely safeguarded in the Bill, and the Bill is simply the machinery to settle the present manner in which the land is to be dealt with ; and this contract indicates one of the conditions upon which the City Fathers propose to treat with the owners of the land ; and they ask for the alternative power of taking the property, as the Premier suggests, under the Public Works Act. Surely there is every conservation of the publlc interest in the Bill, and the reason why I did not lay this agreement on the table when I intro- duced the Bill was that I had not the permis- sion of the promoters of the Bill to do so, and they. on the other hand, had not had the oppor- tunity of doing the owners the courtesy of asking if they had any objection to the agree- ment being produced. That has since been done, and the usual course which has been taken right along in connection with this Bill is still being pursued. I submit that the whole of the proposals are perfectly clear. If the City     Council decide to acquire the land under the contract, then this proposal will be submitted to the citizens at a public meeting, as required by the schedule to " The Municipal Corporations Act, 1900." Whichever means the Corporation decide to employ to acquire the land, the pro- posal under that particular head will be sub- mitted for the consideration of the citizens at a public meeting, and the subsequent machinery required by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1900 will be employed. Mr. SEDDON .-- Would you have any objec- tion to referring this Bill to the Waste Lands Committee ? Mr. HUTCHESON .- I would certainly be willing to bear that suggestion in mind, and to refer it to my principals ; but I might tell the Premier that I would have absolutely declined to touch the paper upon which the Wellington City Recreation Bill was printed if I had not felt perfectly sure in my inmost mind that everything in connection with it was absolutely clean, and in the interests of the City of Wel- lington, and that it was only promoted and safeguarded by men who were absolutely honest in every walk of life, and the very opposite of those who are seeking to obstruct this proposal. Mr. SEDDON said the question was one as to fair value. Mr. Hutcheson Premier that the citizens ought not "to pay too much for their whistle," and if the thing was done in absolute good faith, and there was no sinister motive impelling those who were opposing the Bill. there was not much fear of that. Let them deal with the matter on its merits in an open, fair, and honest way. He would certainly bear the recommendation and suggestion of the Premier to the Mayor of Wel- lington, and, as this was an absolutely fair and square proposal, with only the interests of the city as its main-spring and motive, he would do all things in reason in that direction. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) only wished that everything should be clear and unmistakable in connection with such a matter as this. Unless it were so it would only be entailing very much expense, and, he feared, a protracted debate ; and the time of the House and the con- venience of all concerned would be conserved if the matter were referred to a Committee. He suggested this as a means of removing the dif- ficulties he saw in the way. He only throw it out as a suggestion, and then there would be opportunities for evidence, and plenty of time to make estimates as to values, and as to the necessity, and so forth. At any rate, he threw the suggestion out in order that the honourable gentleman might consider it. Motion agreed to. FINANCIAL STATEMENT. Captain RUSSELL (Hawke's Bay) wished to ask the Colonial Treasurer when he was likely to bring down his Financial Statement. The last time he had the pleasure of asking this question, about a fortnight ago, the right honourable gentleman said it would be brought down in a week or ten days. He hoped on this occasion to receive the answer that it would be brought down this week. Mr. SEDDON (Colonial Treasurer) said this was certainly the week for which he had pro- mised the Financial Statement. He had in- tended and hoped to bring it down as he had promised, but he had been face to face with difficulties that had caused the delay. Captain RUSSELL. -- Not financial, I hope. Mr. SEDDON said, Well, of course, finance was one of the main questions in a Financial Statement, and that was one of the main difi- culties. He had once or twice indicated that they were not so bright as in former years. However, he hoped, if he was not able to bring it down this week, the House would have it probably early next week. # DELAYED QUESTIONS. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) complained that, as the result of the new method of answering questions by grouping in sequence all those addressed to the respective Ministers, the ques- tions addressed to the particular Minister who was put at the end of the list were not answered on the day set down for answering questions. He had himself a question on the Order Paper which had been there for about three weeks and was still unanswered. 
<page:271>
to ? Mr. J. ALLEN said, to the Minister of Lands. It was not answered on the right day, and was passed over then and was not answered at all. Mr. SEDDON thought the honourable mem- ber was absent when it was called on. Mr. J. ALLEN said he was not absent. These questions were never reached, and there were other members in a similar position. Consequently, as they were there, and did not get their questions answered for two or three weeks, he submitted it was a breach of the privileges of the House. MAORI HISTORY AND ART. Captain RUSSELL (Hawke's Bay) asked the Premier, If he will appoint a Select Committee, to sit with any similar Com- mittee which may be appointed by the Legislative Council, to inquire into the ad- visableness and probable cost of forming a national collection illustrating the history of the Maori race? He would be very glad to alter the question in any way to suit the Premier. But the question of providing such a collection had been thought of throughout the colony from one end to the other. He presumed honourable members had seen the charming publication called "Maori Art," which was brought out by Mr. Hamilton, of the Dunedin Museum, which was perpetuating by photogravure illustrations of specimens of Maori art. But he thought it was desirable, before it was too late, that the colony should agree to the establishment of a special central museum wherein specimens of Maori art could be preserved. He had suggested the scheme of a joint Committee, but if the Premier could suggest any better means of dealing with the question he would be happy to fall in with it. Seeing, however, that it would involve a certain amount -probably a considerable amount-of expenditure to get a really good selection, it would be a desirable thing that the two branches of the Legislature should meet and discuss the matter, and make some recom- mendation regarding a scheme, and they might be able to form some sort of idea what the cost of a good collection would be. He hoped the Premier would agree to the principle of his proposal, even if he did not fall in with the idea of a Committee. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said he was pleased that the honourable gentleman had brought this matter directly under the notice of the House. It had not escaped the attention of the Govern- ment. For some considerable time past the Go- vernment had recognised that a large number of Maori art carvings and other works of Maori art, which could not possibly be replaced, were gradually being bought up and taken away from the colony ; and when residents of New Zealand wanted in the future to know any- thing about the colony, and Maori art and science, they would have to go to Germany. That was the position into which we were drifting at present. They thought, first of all, a law should be passed absolutely prohibiting should be the first thing. Secondly, they thought, in regard to Maori lore and art, material should be collated before it was lost. They had already engaged on that work the best man, he thought, in the colony - Nr. Stawell, of Hawera -- who had made it a life study, and who would be able to place the matter before the colony in a way which would reflect credit on himself and carry out fully what was intended. In addition to that, there was another very important matter. In Auckland there had been started a Maori girls' school. Now, he thought, as they would have the later generation of Maoris there, some of the old Maoris should be engaged to teach the younger generation. Going into the back country - the Crewera country, for instance- where civilisation has scarcely touched the Maori, it was found that these works were still being carried on. If, as suggested by the honourable gentleman, a Committee would help the Government, the best course would be to bring in a Bill dealing with the subject, and then that Bill might be referred to a joint Com- mittee of both Houses, and by that means they might help the Government in dealing with the question. He thought it was a duty owing by the colony to future generations that that should be done. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) suggested that the Premier should enlarge the scope of the ques- tion, and then submit it to the Committee. That would be a better way than by bringing in a Bill. He knew the work that Mr. Hamilton was doing, and he knew that a great many of the original records he was putting in his book -canoes, and such like-would very soon be lost altogether, and it would be a great pity if that was so. His work was a great work, and one that they ought to encourage, and he thought the House was in favour of something of the kind being done. He hoped the Premier would set up the Committee, and ask Mr. Hamilton to assist in the work. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) suggested that in setting up the Committee the scope should be so enlarged as to include the isles of Greater New Zealand -- the South Sea Islands lately annexed. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said the Government had taken action in the matter, and they in- tended to proceed. It was not simply on Mr. Hamilton's action that this was being done, but long before Mr. Hamilton went into the matter at all the Government had been work- ing at it. Of course, in the first place, they had to thank the foresight of Sir George Grey. At the same time, he was quite willing to have any assistance they could get ; but Mr. Stawell was on work similar to that which Mr. Hamil- ton was doing, and Mr. Percy Smith was also doing it : and, in respect to the Greater New Zealand Islands, Mr. Percy Smith was going now to the island of Niue, without salary, for three months, for the purpose of becoming acquainted with the natives and all concerning them, and whilst there he would act as Resident Agent for the New Zealand Government. In 
<page:272>
with it in a thorough and complete way, and the first thing they really wanted was legisla- tive power. Parliament, he was sure, would give them the necessary authority and any means they wanted. He would be very happy to have the assistance of Mr. Hamilton, but they already had the assistance of Mr. Percy Smith, Major Gudgeon, and Mr. Stawell. Mr. J. ALLEN said that Mr. Hamilton had been all his life in the work. Mr. SEDDON said, For his own part, he looked upon Mr. Percy Smith as the best living authority at the present time. # THE LICENSING LAWS. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) asked the Government, If they intend to introduce a Bill this session to amend the licensing laws, by repealing or modifying the present confiscatory penalties for minor offences, and removing other anomalies ? He would point out that there was a general consensus of opinion in New Zealand that the present licensing laws were unsatisfac- tory, more especially in the matter of the undue hardships that they imposed very frequently on innocent persons, such as mortgagees of pro- perty and others who, under the existing laws, were liable to have the value of their property very largely diminished without redress through the forfeiture of licenses. There were also several other anomalies, which had been from time to time pointed out, and he thought, with- out introducing any large measure of licensing reform which would cause protracted debate, these minor and necessary amendments might easily be embodied in a short Bill if the Govern- ment did not contemplate introducing a large measure. Though a friend of temperance, he could not regard the existing penalties on inno- cent persons as being in accordance with the principles of justice. He had no sympathy with those who broke the law, but they should take care in their legislation that the innocent should not suffer with the guilty. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) replied that he had said the other day there were difficulties met with in the administration of the present licensing law that made it necessary some amending legislation should be introduced. He would have great pleasure in bringing in a measure dealing with minor questions : but if the opportunity were then taken of introducing larger questions, that would militate to a great extent against getting remedial legislation through that was required. He had no hesita. tion in saying there was much in favour of the English Act with respect to finding people upon licensed premises; and that the removal of licenses, by allowing leases to drop out and putting a licensed house among a people who had not been consulted-shifting the licensed premises perhaps twenty or thirty miles- was an entire evasion of the law. Then, again, in respect to confiscation under the existing law, where there had been practically no fault on the part of the landlord himself, or of the owner of the property - here there ought to be a discretionary power given to the Magistrates. Mr. Seddon and time would determine whether the House would deal with them or not. # ASIATIC RESTRICTION. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton) asked the Premier,-(1.) Whether the Government have noticed the reply of the Imperial Govern- ment to a question asked in the House of Commons, and reported in the Times of 8th June, regarding the vetoing of a Bill passed by the Queensland Legislature prohibiting the employment of Asiatics and other coloured labourers in sugar-mills receiving financial help from the Government ? (2.) Do the Govern- ment accept the dictum apparently laid down that these colonies have no right to legislate against the unlimited influx of Asiatics, and particularly of Japanese? This was an im- portant question, because it had an Imperial bearing. He might point out that in the last session of the Queensland Legislature there were passed four Bills dealing with the construction of railways, each of which con- tained a clause that no aboriginal inhabitant of Asia, Africa, or the Pacific Islands was to be employed upon the railway-works. Strange to say, these four Bills containing that clause were not vetoed by His Excellency Lord Lamington, but there was another Bill, also passed by the Queensland Legislature, providing for the granting of State subsidies with regard to the sugar industry, and this Bill contained a similar clause, that no aboriginal inhabitant of Asia, Africa, or the Pacific Islands should be employed on the sugar mills so subsidised by the Queensland Government. This was re- served for the assent of the Imperial Govern- ment and vetoed. In the Times of the 8th June there was the following report of a ques- tion in the House of Commons :- "Mr. PATRICK O'BRIEN asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies why the Royal sanc- tion had been refused to an Act passed by the Queensland Legislature prohibiting the employ- ment of Asiatics and other coloured labourers in sugar-mills receiving financial help from the Government ? " Mr. CHAMBERLAIN .- His Majesty's Govern- ment have represented to the Queensland Go- vernment that the Bill in question is open to objection on grounds of both principle and policy : first, because it embodies a disqualifi- cation based solely on place of origin, and would therefore exclude British subjects in India and elsewhere, not on account of any moral, edu- cational, or physical deficiency, but solely on difference of race and colour : secondly, that it is offensive to Japan, a friendly Power, inas- much as it not only excludes natives of that country from employment, but also places them in the same category as Asiatics generally, without any consideration being paid to their state of civilisation." It was in regard to the matter in so far as Japan was concerned that his question was chiefly asked. Japan was a country containing a population of between forty-four and forty-five 
<page:273>
land, and within a comparatively short distance of this country. The inhabitants of Japan were progressive, and possessed in a remarkable degree the quality of adaptativeness, so that if the Imperial Government laid it down as a principle that the colonies were not to be al- lowed to restrict the immigration \`of Japanese into these countries, what was to become of the population of New Zealand, which at the present time was much less than one mil- lion, if enormous numbers of Japanese came to make their homes in this colony ? He ventured to say, without introducing argu- able matter, that one of the greatest respon- sibilities that was laid on the colony was to preserve the purity of our race, and if we were to allow a wholesale influx of Japanese into the colony it would alter the whole face of our civilisation, and certainly affect the purity of the race that had been passed down to us by the early settlers of New Zealand. He cer- tainly thought that, in view of the decision of the Imperial Government, vetoing the Act passed, by the Queensland Legislature, this was a most important matter, because, if we were to accept the principle laid down by Mr. Chamberlain we must recognise that the Im- perial Government, for Imperial considerations, were going to insist on the right of the Japanese to enter upon these countries in the same way as European races. If so, good-bye to the purity of our race. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said he did not hold the pessimistic view held by the honourable  member for Riccarton. He was satisfied that if the emergency arose New Zealand would be able to deal with it. If the honourable mem- ber would carry his mind back three or four years he would recollect that the New Zealand Parliament passed the Chinese Restriction Act. That was not consented to, and was therefore practically a dead-letter. Then the question arose, How shall we deal with the matter of this Asiatic influx ? The Secretary of State indicated that there would be no objection to passing a law similar to the law of Natal, and on that the Government introduced " The Immigration Re- striction Act, 1899," which was now law. That Act provided that no person could enter New Zealand unless, when asked to do so by an officer appointed under the Act by the Go- vernor, he was able to write out and sign in the presence of the officer, in any European language, an application in the form of the Second Schedule of the Act, or in some other form that the Colonial Secretary might from time to time direct. Of course, the Asiatics could not read the European language, and therefore that Act was as effectual a bar as the law that was passed by the Queensland Legislature. It was a different thing, however, to pass an Act and apply it to The law of nations then particular nations. applied, and the British Government said that when a friendly nation. was concerned they could not consent to legislation that was specially aimed at that particular nation. VOL. CXVII .- 17. words were, "any aboriginal inhabitants of Asia, Africa, or the Pacific Islands." Mr. SEDDON said, In the first place, that aimed at the Japanese, and it was on account of the Japanese that the Secretary of State advised Her Majesty not to consent to the New Zealand Act of a few years ago. Another ground that was given was that a number of these Asiatics were British subjects. If he remem- bered aright, from his reading of the report, that fact was also mentioned. At any rate, we were already safeguarded in New Zealand under the Act of 1899, which had been ap- proved. Of course, it might be said to him, " But the Japanese will soon learn to write the European language, when they will be able to comply with the test." Then, if they found that to be the case, they had an inherent right to alter the matter. It had been contested- and it had been admitted-within the last three years that, as a matter of State, they could re- fuse or admit any one to our colony. It had to be done by Executive order, and the Govern- ment had to take the responsibility ; but if it was found that any race was coming in such numbers as to militate against the well-being of the colony they had an inherent right to close their doors. That was the position, and, as he had said, it had been admitted. At the same time, in his opinion, it was not wise for colonial Legislatures to pass legislation which might cause difficulties with the Mother- country ; and when they could obtain the same object without doing it -as they in New Zea- land had done-he thought the proper course was to be friendly with all, and at the same time maintain the advantage of race that they already possessed in the colony. If the Imperial authorities attempted to force this colony to say that a race should be admitted here to the disadvantage of our people, and who would be a burden to our people, then they had the in- herent right to step in and meet it ; and, that being the case, he thought there had been a misconception in respect to the answer given by the Secretary of State. In conclusion, he might say, as far as New Zealand was concerned, that they had never had any difficulty whatever with the Colonial Office. The Colonial Office had on every occasion met them reasonably : and, on this very question, with the correspondence that the Government had in its possession, they were very well satisfied with the Colonial Office. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL asked if there were any cases of persons being refused admission to the colony under the provisions of the Act in connection with the educational test. Mr. SEDDON said, Yes; in fact, he might say the Asiatics were treated as Chinese. MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS ACT. Mr. ELL (Christchurch City) asked the Pre- mier, Whether he will introduce an amend- ment to "The Municipal Corporations Act, 1900," to enable 5 per cent. of the ratepavers in adjoining boroughs to demand a poll in their 
<page:274>
mation ? He might point out that the Act of last session provided respecting boroughs that amalgamation' could only be done by special order. In the neighbourhood of Christchurch there were three boroughs, and the burgesses in each district protested against this power being given to the Council. They said they should be consulted in the matter. Provision was made in the Act as to joining a portion of a district to a borough : 25 per cent. of the people by petition might accomplish that ; but, with regard to the amalgamation of two boroughs, that could only be done by special order. The opinion had been freely expressed that they should have the power in the respective dis- triets to determine at a poll whether amalgama- tion should take place or not. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said he believed that every latitude and freedom should be given in respect to obtaining the voice of the ratepayers upon a question of the importance mentioned by the honourable member. But the difficulty would be in bringing in an amending Act this session. He was not sure whether there would be an opportunity to do that. He thought every facility should be given, and he thought these smaller boroughs hovering round the larger bodies meant increased administrative cost, and it might be better if they were amalgamated. # GASWORKS COMPULSORY PUR- CHASING. Mr. ELL (Christchurch City) asked the Premier, If he will this session introduce a Bill giving local authorities compulsory purchasing- power of gasworks, at a price to be fixed by arbitration ? He brought this matter before the special Committee on the Municipal Cor- porations Bill last session, but, in deference to a number of members who thought it was undesir- able to introduce the question, as it would meet with a lot of opposition, he did not propose it when the Bill came before the House. There were a number of boroughs in which the gas- works were owned by companies. No pro- vision was made to purchase those works, and legislation was necessary in each case. That being so, it seemed to him that it would be far better to give the local authorities general compulsory purchasing-powers, and to let the price be fixed by arbitration. In some cases these properties were paying their owners handsomely, and there was a natural reluctance on the part of the companies to part with them. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said that, summed up, the question was muitum in parco : it really asked the Government if they were prepared to pass a measure which would take from the Christchurch Gas Company the posses- sion- Mr. ELL .- No, no : general powers. Mr. SEDDON. - They had already had a fight on the floor of the House about the powers given to gas companies under the old Municipal Cor- porations Act. Those powers could not be al- tered unless bv special legislation. For some years the legislation had been general, and the Mr. Ell taken ; but it was a question as to whether they were prepared to take away by legislation the rights of the old gas companies. There was a good deal to be said on both sides, and at present he was in the middle. # STOKE ORPHANAGE. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) asked the Premier, Whether any report will be presented to Parliament relative to the management of the Stoke Orphanage under the new régime ; and, if so, when? He wished to add three words to the question -"special or separate." The honourable gentleman was, of course, aware that there was a general desire on the part of the great bulk of the people of the colony to learn what the result of the new management of the Stoke Orphanage had been, and he wished to know whether there would be any special or separate report upon the management of the institution. There would probably be, in the annual report of the Minister of Education, some general cursory reference to all the indus- trial schools of the colony ; but, under the very special circumstances, he thought it desirable that a special or separate report upon the Stoke Industrial School should be submitted to Parlia- ment. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) thought the House last session had given quite enough considera- tion to the Stoke Orphanage, and he was very happy to be able to say that there was now no necessity to give special consideration to it. Reforms had been worked there, and, so far as he knew, everything was working very satisfac- torily. He did not know what the object of the honourable gentleman was in calling attention to the institution by means of the question. As the Orphanage was working like all similar institutions, it was the intention of the Gio- vernment to deal with it in the ordinary report ; but, as honourable members had their attention drawn to it so much last session, he could not foretell what the report would be. He had no doubt, however, that it would be satisfactory. # VOLUNTEERS' LOST RIFLES. Mr. McNAB (Mataura) asked the Minister of Defence, Whether, in charging corps with the cost of missing rifles, the present market value is charged, or the cost of the weapons at a time prior to their becoming out of date ? Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said the department simply charged the cost price. Mr. McNAB. - Even if the rifles are out of date ? Mr. SEDDON said No ; he was selling some rifles which originally cost $3 10s. for 10s. # STATE COAL-MINES. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) asked the Premier, Whether the Government intend to nationalise one or more coal-mines to put the country in a condition of preparedness to meet every possible emergency of State, and also to enable the Government to supply coal at a reasonable cost to the poor? He was aware 
<page:275>
ing of Parliament there was contained this paragraph : - " My Ministers desire to bring under your notice the increased prices payable for coal for State requirements. As a way of meeting this difficulty, and to insure a supply of coal for Government purposes at reasonable rates, it is essential that a State coal-mine be established. The great and growing demand for coal, and the inadequacy of the supply from the coal- mines on the west coast of the Middle Island, also render a State coal-mine advisable." The language was a little flowery, but, never- theless, it created a belief in the minds of the people of the colony that a State coal-mine would be established. Indeed, it went further : it buoyed people up with the confident feeling that the Government really did intend to esta- blish a State coal-mine ; and yet no such inten- tion was expressed in the paragraph. Suppose the Government did say in the paragraph that it was their intention, their definite intention, to establish a State coal-mine, even then there would be no guarantee that the Government would establish a State coal-mine ; because it would be most unusual, it would be extra- ordinary, if the Government gave effect to every promise contained in the Governor's Speech. No Government ever gave effect to every promise contained in the Governor's Speech. The honourable gentleman would re- member that in March last, just prior to the Wellington municipal elections, which took place on the 1st April, the newspapers were  deluged with correspondence, with reports of interviews with Ministers, interviews with coal dealers, and interviews with the poor of the city, who were deeply concerned in the question of a cheap coal - supply. It was a burning question, and the people became much impressed with the views of the Premier upon the subject. Several people who took an interest in the great coal agitation of March last, and in the interviews which appeared daily in the newspapers, had brought pressure to bear on him to force the hands of the Govern- ment, in order to ascertain whether they really did intend to carry out their intention to establish a State coal-mine or not. He would not say that there was any want of belief in the minds of the people in regard to what really were the intentions of the Government, but, certainly, he had been asked to put the question in this pointed way, and he now asked the Government whether, in accordance with this paragraph of the Governor's Speech, it was the intention of the Government to establish a State coal-mine ? Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said the fair lady- if he might term the honourable gentleman who represented Wellington so -- put to him the question of whether or not a promise that had been made was to be performed, or whether he was to leave the Governor liable to be brought before the House and the country for a breach of promise. He said there was quite sufficient in what was stated in the Governor's Speech to constitute a breach of promise in that ment to open a State coal-mine. Mr. FISHER .- When ? Mr. SEDDON said, As soon as Parliament gave its authority. The Government intended asking Parliament to give them that authority. Mr. FISHER .- This session. Mr. SEDDON said, Yes, this session. They had already appointed Mr. Gordon, Mr. Mckay, the Government Geologist, and the Inspecting Engineer, Mr. Hayes, to proceed and select a site for a mine for the country. The next course would be to ask Parliament to give them authority, and then for the House to give them an appropriation, and so on. It was their intention to have a State coal-mine, and they hoped to have it in work before next session. The price they were paying now for coal for Government use was such as to warrant. the Parliament dealing with the question at once. He thought they were paying 7s. 6d. or 8s. a ton that could be saved, and, that being the case, they had a right to save it. And in dealing with the Government supply the other question of the price paid for coal for private consumption would come in. His own opinion was that the people were almost blackmailed in connection with the price they had to pay now for coal in this colony. There was a combina- tion, and only the other day he had seen a notice sent by a secretary of a company to a coal dealer in Auckland, saying that because the dealer had sold a lesser quantity of coal than had been agreed on amongst themselves he would get no more coal. Well, if they had got to that state of things in this colony, it was time they liberated themselves, and Parliament would be asked before very long to give legisla- tive authority for the opening-up of a State coal-mine for State purposes. OLD SOLDIERS' AND SAILORS' CLAIMS. Mr. McGUIRE (Hawera) asked the Govern- ment, When they will finally settle the naval and military land claims, so that equity may be done to those old and deserving soldiers and sailors of the Imperial and colonial forces who rendered valuable services in the early days of this country ? This question had been asked and commented upon so often that he would simply ask the question without comment on this occasion in order to save time. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said Parliament had the matter in its own hands. Time after time they had passed legislation stating that it was final ; and, it having been so dealt with, until Parliament changed its mind the Government could not move in the matter. # RIFLE CLUBS. Mr. LETHBRIDGE (Rangitikei) asked the Minister of Defence, When those rifle clubs which have requested to be made Government rifle clubs may expect their request to be com- plied with? He asked this question because one or two rifle clubs in his district had applied to be formally admitted as Government rifle clubs, but they had not received any reply to their applications. He hoped the Minister 
<page:276>
would be dealt with at once. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said a very large number of clubs had applied to be approved by the Government, but they had not stated whether they were within the five-mile limit mentioned in the regulations, and the applications had been returned for further par- ticulars. He might state, however, that the other day he accepted a large number of these clubs. He would like them to be ready for the sumner shooting season, and he had given orders that all the orders should be brought up, and he would agree to them, contingent on the regulations being complied with. If they did not comply with the regulations, of course they would not be in time for the season ; but a large number had already been approved. Mr. RHODES ( Ellesmere) asked if the Pre- mier would give the House a list of those clubs that had been accepted. Mr. SEDDON said, If the honourable gentle- man would mention any one in his own district he would tell him at once what the position in respect to it was. MATAKANUI LANDS FOR SETTLEMENT. Mr. BENNET (Tuapeka) asked the Govern- ment, If they will resume a block of Crown lands in the Matakanui district, with the view of having the same thrown open for close settlement ? He asked this question last ses- sion, and the Minister of Lands premised during the recess to see the land for himself; but doubtless he had not found it convenient to get away on account of the work he required to  do in the North Island. The people of this district had been applying for land for the past twenty-five or thirty years, and as the land in this district was considered fit and suitable for the purpose, and it could be obtained, it was promised that the Minister of Lands should visit the district and inspect the land ; but he believed that had not been done. During the election-time. when he visited the place, the electors asked him if he would endeavour to get land for them. He told them he would see the land, and he did so. He felt thoroughly satis- fied that it was perfectly suitable for the purpose of cutting up for close settlement, and, although it was generally contended that if they took the frontages it would destroy the run, he felt convinced that that would not be the case, as the people asking for the land were prepared to take up the rough portions along with the good, from the frontage to the bound- ary of the run. Had the Minister of Lands found it convenient to have gone to see the land he would have found a number of the settlers waiting on him to explain their wants. There was also a considerable number of old miners down there, who had been in the district for about thirty years, and they were anxious to get a bit of land to settle on, but at present they were not able to get it. He hoped the Minister would give him a favourable answer to the question. He had brought this matter before the Hon. John Mckenzie when he was there, and had told him what had taken place, and Mr. Lethbridge saw the land was suitable for settlement, and they wanted it, they would get it. He (Mr. Bennet ) repeated this last session to the Minis- ter of Lands : but, of course, he had not seen the land. He hoped he would take the earliest opportunity of seeing it. It was Crown land, and there was nothing to pay for it. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said the attention of the Land Purchase Inspector would be directed to the matter mentioned in the ques- tion. # CAMBRIDGE DOMAIN. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) asked the Premier, Whether he intends to act on the re- port of Mr. Northcroft with regard to the Cam- bridge Domain ; and, if not, whether he will take steps to have a further inquiry made ? This question referred to a matter that had been in abevance for some time. The Cambridge Domain Board consisted of five members, and in February last a vacancy was caused by the death of one of the members. The Borough Council recommended one gentleman for ap- pointment and the Domain Board recommended another. Under the circumstances, the Minis- ter of Lands suggested that a public meeting should be held at which a gentleman to fill the vacancy should be selected. The public meet- ing was held, and the gentleman who had been recommended by the Porough Council was se- lected by a majority of four votes only. The Domain Board considered that to be a vote of want of confidence and rosigned in a body. The Minister of Lands was informed that they had resigned, and suggested that a public meeting should be held to consider the whole matter, and also wrote and thanked them for theirservices. A public meeting was held on the 11th April, and it was called together by a requisition signed by 258 people ; and that meeting was thoroughly representative, as far as he understood, and, judging from the names of those who signed the requisition, he was quite certain it was. This meeting recommended that the Board should consist of seven members, and sug- gested the names of members who would form a Board that would give more representation to Cambridge West. which had previously been a bone of contention. These resolutions vere passed unanimously and forwarded to the Go- vernment. The reply of the Minister of Lands was contained in the Gazette of 9th May. in which the Minister cut the Board in half ard appointed two weak Domain Boards, instead of two strong ones. No one that he know of asked for this solution of the difficulty. if difficulty there was. Exception was taken to this division into two Boards, and a telegram was sent by the secretary of the Liberal or- ganization to the Premier, and the Premier promised that Mr. Northcote, the Resident Magistrate there, would go down and report. Mr. Northcote did go down and inspected the books and minutes which he got from the Chairman of the Domain Board, and, he believed, reported. He now asked the Pre- mier whether he would act on that report, or 
<page:277>
matter. The matter should not be left in the state it was at present. The Premier knew perfectly well that the work done by the old Board was for the benefit of the town, and high praise had been given them for it by the Premier himself, and by every Governor and Minister who had visited Cambridge. It was impossible for those improvements, that had made Cambridge one of the prettiest towns in the colony, to go on if the two Boards were divided as they were at present. He thought the people should be informed whether Mr. Northcroft's report would be acted on, whether further inquiries would be made, or whether matters were to be left in the present unsatis- factory state. It was important to the Domain Board to know, as the spring was the proper time for planting, and the majority of their operations were carried on at that time of the year. He trusted the Premier would put an end to this uncertainty by a definite announce- ment. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said there had been repeated and continual squabbhng over this matter, and the Government had cut the gordian knot and changed the administra- tion. The Board resigned, and they did the next best thing, they thought, for the adminis. tration of the domain. There had been jealousy between the Cambridge East and West Boards, and there appeared to be no doubt, from what he could gather, that the Cambridge West people had good cause of complaint. In asking the Stipendiary Magistrate to report, it was his intention that he should take evidence on both sides ; but that gentleman only went and saw the Chairman and one or two members of one body. According to his source of information and the short time he had for investigation his report was quite justified, but he did not think his report had given satisfaction. The Govern- ment had decided to do nothing-to let things simmer and cool down, hoping that time and reflection would bring about a better state of things. When the proper time came the Go- Vernment would deal with the matter, and in the meantime further inquiries would be made. Mr. HERRIES asked if he understood the Premier to say that inquiry would be made. Mr. SEDDON .- Yes. GOVERNMENT AND OCEAN ACCIDENT INSURANCE PREMIUMS. Mr. SYMES (Egmont) asked the Govern- ment, If they will make inquiries into the difference of premium charges between the Government Accident Insurance Company and the Ocean Accident Insurance Company ? Mr. SEDDON said inquiries would be made. CROWN TENANTS' RENT REBATE. Mr. SYMES (Egmont) asked the Premier, When the return asked for on Order Paper No. 1, Notice of Motion No. 5, will be laid on the table ? The return was as follows :- "That there be laid before this House a re- turn showing,-(1) The amount of rebate granted to Crown tenants under 'The Crown Tenants' tenants in each land district to which rebate has been granted, giving the annual rent, and the amount of rebate allowed to each ; and (3) the total amount of rebate in each land dis- trict." Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said instructions had been issued for the preparation of the return. The department had to communicate with all the Land Boards, and as soon as the information was to hand the return would be laid on the table. COOK ISLANDS NATIVE LAND COURT. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) asked the Premier, When he intends to set up a Native Land Court in the Cook Islands Group, as mentioned in his memorandum inclosed in despatch No. 87 from His Excellency the Governor to Her Majesty's Principal Secre- tary of State for the Colonies ? He would read an extract from the memorandum in question : - "It is well known to His Excellency the Governor and to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that it has ever been the desire of the Government of New Zealand to improve the condition of the Polynesian and Papuan races inhabiting the islands in the Pacific ; and by a reference to the Premier's memorandum No. 91, setting forth the conditions on which the boundaries of our colony were to be extended so as to include the Cook and other islands, it will be found, -- (1) That the ownership of the lands in Cook Islands Group be admitted ; (2) that a Court on the same lines as the Native Land Court established in New Zealand, or a Commission, should define the ownership of the particular areas, and to decide as to its sub- division and partition." He wished to know if it was the intention of the Government to set up a Native Land Court as promised. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said the Government would, when the proper time came and the question was raised as between the parties more directly affected, and when they were asked to deal with this matter, comply with this request. As the honourable member knew, they only obtained possession on the 11th June, and there must be some little interregnum before they could possibly deal wholly and fully with the new possessions. In the meantime it was wise not to make too many changes, but to go along slowly and steadily. # HOTEL LICENSES. Mr. LAWRY (Parnell) asked the Premier, If he will, in any Bill introduced this session to amend the Licensing Acts, introduce a pro- vision to the effect that eleven p.m. shall be the hour of closing for licensed houses in all cities and boroughs ? At the present time the affairs in Auckland were extremely disgraceful. In their stupidity, the Committee elected by the people declared for ten o'clock closing, whereas in the district represented by the honourable member for Eden, including the Borough of Devonport, they have eleven o'clock closing, 
<page:278>
closed at ten o'clock, could, by crossing in the ferry to Devonport, get as much drink as they liked up to eleven o'clock. He hoped the honourable gentleman would give him a favour- able reply. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said he was in favour of the closing hours of hotels being universal. POLICE OFFENCES BILL. This Bill, as amended by the Legislative Council, came down by message at half-past seven p.m. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Justice) said, Though this Bill has been altered somewhat, I believe the amendments are an improvement. Subsection (2) has been struck out, but the proviso has been re-enacted in a new clause in the present Bill. There are some words that have been struck out. For instance, in subsection (2) of clause 3 " view or" is struck out, and also "passing therein or residing." I think the Bill will be an improvement on the Police Offences Act, and I am prepared to move that the amendments be agreed to. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) .- I do not get up with the object of opposing the amendments, but to object to the way in which this sort of thing is done, and the business conducted. Over and over again last session, important amendments were made in the Upper House, and when the Bills came down, exactly as has been the case in this instance, honourable members were asked to approve of the amend- ments without knowing what they were. The consequence has been that some of the  measures are now law in a different form from what was intended by this House. I say that in every case the amendments ought to be printed and circulated, so that we may know what we are doing. I would suggest to the Minister of Justice that in this case the amend- ments should be printed and circulated before the question is put. If not, I shall feel it my duty to divide the House on the question. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- We do not want to lay down any precedent that is at all against the proper conduct of business ; and there is no wish or desire to force members to consider at once amendments where they are material ; but sometimes where they are not material there is no object in delay. Where there is any material matter for objection, I am sure my colleague will not press the matter. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton) .- Sir, I was only going to say that this is an important Bill, and it is quite impossible for any honour- able member to follow the amendments that have been made by the Upper House, from the statement of the honourable gentleman in charge. I have not the slightest idea what the explanation given was ; I understand it was of a purely technical character as to the alterations. I certainly hope that before he presses the matter of the acceptance of these amendments he will give the House an opportunity of seeing the amendments by seeing them in print. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) .- I happen to have seen the amendments made in the i Mr. Lawry materially alter the provisions of the Bill. I certainly think they should be reprinted so that honourable members can see them. Nearly every clause is altered, and, as it is only a small Bill of three clauses, one can understand that the changes make considerable alterations. The original clause 2 has been struck out, and the proviso I put in in Committee has been made the new clause. The Bill introduced by the Minister has disappeared almost entirely. I think it is a great improvement, but I think it ought to be reprinted for honourable members to see. I shall vote against the proposal, as a protest against considering amendments that have not been printed for the House to see. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Justice) .- Per- sonally, I have no objection to its being re- printed, but I think there is no necessity. If honourable members had paid attention to the Bill when I explained it they would have under- stood what the amendments were. I pointed out that clause 2 was struck out, and that the proviso had been re-enacted in its place as a new clause. That is the only important altera- tion made, with the exception that in subsec- tion (2) of clause 3, "view or" has been struck out, and the words "passing therein or re- siding " have also been struck out. An Hon. MEMBER .-- What is the effect of that. Mr. McGOWAN. - If the honourable gentle- man had read the Bill, and paid attention to i these things he would have known the effect. Mr. GUINNESS (Grey). - In clause 2 the Minister proposed an amendment of subsec- tion (29) of section 3 of the Police Offences Act by inserting the word "or"-that is, putting " or " between " using insulting language in a public place " and " within hearing of persons passing by." The Legislative Council have struck that clause out. Before the Bill left this Chamber a proviso was added to that clause, on the motion of the honourable mem- ber for the Bay of Plenty, to the effect that the interpretation of the words "public place," as used in Part II. of the Act, should be the interpretation given to the words " public place " in the 3rd section of the Act dealing with this question. That proviso has been re-enacted in place of the clause struck out in another place. That is the real meaning of the amendment. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- Mr. Herries's clause is now the Bill instead of the Minister's clause. Mr. GUINNESS .- That is so. Major STEWARD (Waitaki) .-- I wish to ex- plain the reason why the words "view of" were struck out, as I was on the Statutes Revision Committee when the Bill was con- sidered. The words were struck out because it was pointed out that it was an absurdity to talk about using obscene language " within the view " of any person. Mr. HERRIES .- I would like to ask when the word "reputed " was struck out. Mr. McGOWAN .- It was struck out in the Statutes Revision Committee, and re-inserted by the other Chamber.

ALLEN (Bruce) .- Sir, I have 2.30. a few words more to say before closing my remarks. I had been referring to the speech of the honourable member for Christchurch City (Mr. Ell), and pointing out that the statistics he introduced to the House were not as reliable as one might have expected them to be. from the fact that they were estimates of his own, and not instances from actual experience. The Act has been in force in some districts in New Zealand for some time, and I expected     the honourable gentleman was quoting from actual facts and experiences after the Act had come into operation. We were led to believe, however, from his subsequent remarks that that was not so, and we were also led to that conclu- sion from the fact that he referred to some printed matter which he circulated on the eve of the poll being taken. His facts, therefore, whatever value they may have, have only the value that may be given to estimates. Now, Sir, this Act intends to make rating on unimproved values compulsory, and that is my objection. There is a great deal to be said, as I stated in my open- ing remarks the other evening, for rating on unimproved values in certain districts, and there is a great deal to be said against it ; but there is nothing to be said in favour of making it compulsory, and that is why I object to it. Mr. SEDDON .- Why should it not be ? Mr. J. ALLEN .- Why not? I will ask the honourable gentleman why he has introduced the Act at all? If it is to be compulsory on the one leg, why should it not be on the other? Now, the Act has been brought into operation in thirty-three districts. A poll has been taken in forty. It has been rejected in seven districts, so that only forty of the local bodies in New Zealand have spoken their voices on the matter. I was pointing out that five counties and a hundred boroughs, and I do not know how many Road Boards, and out of that number of 185 only forty have expressed their voices on the matter, and only thirty- three have decided in favour of it. Mr. BOLLARD .- There are nearly five hun- dred local bodies. Mr. J. ALLEN .- Well, at all events, it is sufficient for my purpose to point out that, as far as the boroughs and the counties are con- cerned, there are 185, and that only thirty- three have decided in favour of rating on un- improved values. Now, why is it to be made compulsory ? If out of 185 bodies 120, or some such number, had decided in favour of rating on unimproved values, then the Premier might have had some reason for saying, " I am going to make this rating on unimproved values compulsory all over," because, as he said, he wanted a uniform rate in New Zealand. But, if he wants a uniform rate, this Bill does not give it. The clauses in the Bill omit certain works- waterworks and gasworks --- from the rating on unimproved values, and, instead of the rate being uniform, it will be less uniform. In one district you will have rating on the capi- tal or annual value, and in others on the unim- proved value for some purposes and on the capi- tal value for others. There is no uniformity in the Bill, and it is not a measure that will make rating in New Zealand uniform; and if it were, then I say that all the arguments are in favour of retaining that which is at pre- sent adopted by the majority of the local bodies, and, if there were a necessity for being com- pulsory at all, it ought to be in the direction of rating on the capital or the annual value. Now, with regard to the statistics quoted by the honourable member for Christchurch City (Mr. Ell), I pointed out, with regard to those statistics, that in thirty-three districts the vote had been carried, and that in seven the vote had been lost. But it is interesting to examine the polls. I find that little interest has been taken, even in the very district in which the honourable member has been agitating. Take, for instance, the question as it was decided in the district of the member for Ashley -- the Cheviot County. There are 345 persons on the roll in the Cheviot County, and out of that number only 119 went to the poll. Now, where were the remainder ? Mr. SEDDON .- They are satisfied. The man who stops at home is satisfied to let it go. Mr. J. ALLEN .- I say the man who stops at home is satisfied with what he has got, and therefore stays at home. Then, in Eketahuna there are 600 on the roll, and only 102 went to the poll, and these 102 carried rating on unim- proved values. That is no voice of the rate- payers. If I were to go over the other figures it would show the same result. An Hon. MEMBER. - Look at Sydenham. Mr. J. ALLEN .-- It was carried in Syden- ham ; but, unfortunately, the number of per- sons on the roll is not given in the return. However, I am sure that what applies to other places applies also to Sydenham. In Sydenham 
<page:280>
the proposal. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- There is a popula- tion of twelve thousand. Mr. J. ALLEN. - " There is a population of twelve thousand," and only 546 votes were re- corded. Now, that brings me to the matter of plural voting, and in that respect it is curious to examine this return, because, if I read the return correctly, the voting on unimproved value proposal has been carried in some instances by plural voting. Mr. ELL .- There are no plural votes in Sydenham. Mr. J. ALLEN .- Well, that I cannot tell, because, as I say, the number of persons on the roll is not given. But in other districts one can see what has been the result of plural voting. Take, for instance, the Cheviot County : I do not think the honourable gentleman will say there has not been plural voting there. Although only 119 persons voted, there were 206 votes recorded. Is there plural voting there? I should say there was. And you can go through this re- turn, and I can safely say I believe that in many instances rating on the unimproved value has been carried by the plural vote. Why? Be- cause the man who has got the plural vote -- the big man-knows he is to get off easily. Now, I ask those who wish really to consider this question from the point of view of equity, to decide, in the face of this return, whether it is right to make this thing compulsory. That is the question. There are districts where, I believe, rating on the unimproved value is pre- ferable to the present system. With respect  to the City of Wellington, what would be the result ? I am afraid the honourable member for Christchurch City, in saying what he has, has forgotten one thing. I think he has forgotten in some of the cases he mentioned that the rating was on the annual value, and not on the capital value. Mr. ELL .- No. Mr. J. ALLEN .- The honourable member says "No." I may say that I very nearly fell into the same mistake, because I tried to com- pare rating under the unimproved value in Wellington with what it would have been on the capital value, and I found it would not work out. Why? Because in Wellington- and, I suppose, in other places -- there is no de- finite proportion between the capital and the annual value. The annual value is supposed to be 5 per cent. on the capital value. But that is not so. It is a curious fact that, with respect to the City of Wellington-that is, a few years ago, at any rate-the annual value in certain instances, instead of being 5 per cent. on the capital value, was only 3 per cent., and in another instance it was 10 per cent. I want to know whether that is a fair system of rating : that one man should be assessed for the annual value at 3 per cent. on the capital value, and that another man should be assessed at 10 per cent. ? It destroys, therefore, all comparison, at any rate, with respect to Wellington, bo- cause there is no settled proportion between the annual and the capital value. Now I come Mr. J. Allen wish to say a few words only. I admit that there is a great deal to be said on both sides. I can understand that where a man has very large improvements upon his ground he would wish to be rated on the unimproved value. That is only natural, because he would have to pay less. Wealthy people in many cases will get off by paying less. But I will say this too : that in a suburban district, where a working- man has got a cottage on a piece of land, the land being of small value, and where the pro- portion of improvements-that is to say, the house-is large compared with the land, in that case the working-man will get off with \-- -- paying less. There is no doubt that the man who will get off with paving less is the man who has improvements which are not up to the general ratio of improvements in the locality. Take, for instance, the City of Wellington. The ratio of the improved to the unimproved in the City of Wellington in 1898 was as 1 to 1:56. Therefore all those properties with a ratio of improved to unimproved as 1 to 1.56 will, under the rating on unimproved value, pay exactly the same as at present-that is, if the property originally was rated on the capital value ; but if the proportion of the unimproved land to the improvements increases beyond 1:56, then the owner will have to pay more, and if the proportion falls below 1.56, then he will have to pay less, and as the proportion falls lower he will have to pay less and less. 1 But it is difficult to form any very definite opinion with respect to any particular building in Wellington. I know some banks that will have to pay less, and I know others that will have to pay more. It depends entirely on the ratio of the unimproved value to the improved value. But one can take two specific instances of land of similar value next door to one another -one with improvements to the extent of, say, three to one, and the other with improvements of, say, one to one. In the first instance given the man will have to pay less taxation under the rating on the unimproved value than he did before, and the man next door to him would have to pay more. An Hon. MEMBER .-- Make him put up a better building. Mr. J. ALLEN .- Why should he? If he has a building sufficient for all his purposes and good enough for the community, why should he have to spend an extra $1,000 to put up an extravagant building? You cannot wish a man to put up a better building than is suitable to his surroundings. Now I will take you to the country. Go to a farming district. A man puts up buildings to suit his requirements as a farmer, but his neighbour puts up an elaborate residence and elaborate stables and other build- ings. The latter owner has a fine carriage and horses, and he uses the roads ten times more than his neighbour ; yet he would only pay the same on the unimproved value. Is that fair ? In that instance it is not fair. I say there is no argument, therefore, to make this Bill com- pulsory. Leave it in the hands of the people to say whether they will have it or not. "Trust 
<page:281>
the people in this instance then? I do not think it should be made compulsory. 1 assert again that there are arguments both for and against the principle of the Bill. some instances it is obviously fair that land which is lying unoccupied and unimproved, and which is held for speculative purposes, should bear a higher proportion of taxation than it does now ; but in other instances rating on the unimproved value would not be fair. For instance, there is the case of the property in the country with fine buildings -- residence, stables, et cetera. The owner of that build- ing uses the roads more, he receives more in the way of protection from the police, and in every way, I say, he ought to bear a larger pro- portion of the burdens of the State than his poorer neighbour. The more costly the works are that are being protected the more they should bear their fair share of the cost of pro- tection ; but in such instances the rating on unimproved value would not provide for this. I do not wish to say more about this matter. I have here a report by the Town Clerk of the City of Wellington, which was made some years ago, and his conclusions are very much the same as mine. He says that house property generally would in all proba- bility have to pay a little less, and that, while several of the larger institutions would pay more, some would pay less. I have come to the conclusion that, as a general principle, no conclusion can be drawn from his report or from any other report. The best people to  decide these matters are those living in the particular localities, and who know all the conditions. They are the people to say at the ballot which system of rating would be the most desirable. With regard to uniformity, I hope we shall not adopt a scheme under which we shall have a Road Board having a system of rating on unimproved value and a County Council having another. True, the compulsory scheme would do away with that ; but, after all, it is best to leave the matter to the voice of the people, for they are certainly the best able to decide what system would suit parti- cular localities. Mr. ELL (Christchurch City) .-- Sir, I rise to make a personal explanation. The honourable gentleman said, with regard to the number of proposals that had been rejected, that I had misled the House with respect to the number of polls carried in favour of rating on land- values. I said all the polls had been carried on the voting with the exception of three. Mr. J. ALLEN .- You said three boroughs. Mr. ELL .- I said that in only three districts had the proposal been rejected on the votes, and they were Picton, Timaru, and Woolston. It was carried in all the others on the vote. Mr. J. ALLEN .-- The honourable gentleman, in his supplementary remarks, adds words which make a considerable alteration. He now says, " Rejected on the votes," but in his first remarks he only said " Rejected." I quote the return to prove that I was right : The proposal was first carried ; rejected in Petone Borough, and still rejected ; rejected in the Picton Borough, and still rejected ; rejected in the Raglan County, In and still rejected ; rejected in Stratford, and afterwards carried ; rejected in Sumner Borough, and still rejected ; rejected in Tauranga, and afterwards carried ; rejected in Timaru, and still re ected ; rejected in Waimate Borough, and afterwards carried : rejected in Wairarapa North County, and still rejected ; rejected in Woolston Borough, and still rejected. Mr. TANNER (Avon) .--- I would like to say a few words on this subject, because it is one of considerable interest, and, whether for good or for evil, it will be altogether a ne . departure in fixing the basis upon which local taxation is to be levied. The principle of rating on unim- proved value, as a basic principle, had my sup- port five years ago, and will continue to have my support. I am not, however, in the least degree satisfied with the Bill now before the House, because it proposes to make rating on unimproved value compulsory throughout the colony, without any exemption, without any differentiation, and without any consideration for the different classes of people it will touch. I think it is rather an exaggeration to say that the polls on the subject of adopting the pro- visions of the Act on the statute-book, the results of which have been laid before this House in a recent return, prove that the com- munity at large approves of the principle of the measure generally. If one analyses the polls which have been taken he will see that the adoption of the principle has been carried in many places at lamentably small polls, which we so much deplore when any question is remitted to the public vote. It is, however, the business of the ratepayers in the various localities ; and we may regret, but have no right to blame them if they allow such ques- tions to be settled by small minorities. I have nothing to say with regard to the principle itself; that was adopted by this House five years ago, and it is not for us now to advance arguments either supporting it or detracting from the principle. The only matter which is dealt with in the Bill is, in effect, the question, Shall or shall not rating on the unimproved value be made compulsory throughout the colony? A great many illus- trations have been given, and a good deal has been said about the small cottager, the pro- prietor of a large mansion worth $10,000, or the owner of a large mercantile establishment, all of whom occupy land of equal value in im- mediate contiguity to each other, being rated alike under this Bill, no matter what the value of their total possessions might be. As I listened to speaker after speaker the other night on this Bill, each speaking from his own point of view, I thought that a political kaleidoscope was passing before me. For instance, it seemed to me that the speech of the honourable mem- ber for Manawatu was far more against the present system of valuation in the colony than in support of rating on the unimproved value. 
<page:282>
are utterly fallacious, for they are based on the assumption that the owner of land pays the That is utterly contradictory of our rates. " Rating Act, 1884," which provides, in clause 15, that the occupier shall be primarily responsible for all rates. This throws a great deal of light on the subject, and the matter should be recon- sidered from this point of view, because I hold that the position of the tenant has not been considered in any way. Throughout the debate the other night there rang a tone of exultation from various speakers on the position into which the House has now got the "fat man " ; but the House has not got the " fat man " into a corner in the least. What will be done by passing this Bill in its present bald form is to put the tenant between the upper and the nether millstone, to draw the last drop of blood out of him. I would ask, Why do we have a cry year after year for a Fair Rent Bill from the tenants of rented pro. perties ? And the Government has promised one so often that we do not know whether it intends to deal with the question or not. If rents are too high -- and I hold that they are in the main, and criminally so -and if legislation is necessary, what is the House thinking of in passing a Bill which makes rating on unim- proved values compulsory, and vastly increases the rates which tenants are made legally liable to pay, without any attention being given to the change thus effected? I am not at all against rating on the unimproved value -my support is with the principle. I am speaking against this Bill in its present shape, and its provisions being so imperious and indiscrimi-  nating. Everybody seems to claim the right to quote all manner of instances. Let me give a few. What shall we say as to the position of a small suburban farmer who rents valuable land in that zone which rings-in every town of the colony, and whose land is generally held in small areas for dairy farms and vegetable and market gardens, and nearly always on short- dated leases ? The owner will not give a long lease, owing to the fact that the land is daily in- creasing in value and will soon be required to meet the growing necessities of the town, the very contingency which the owner desires. On most of these lands there are 3.0. practically no improvements worthy of notice. It may be an old cottage thirty or forty years old, or it may be a milking-shed or stable - a few trifling improvements which count for nothing when it comes to the ques- tion of valuation. The bulk of the value is in the unimproved value of the land. By passing this Bill without making any reservation on behalf of these unfortunate tenants, whom the Government are so anxious, or professedly anxious, to help in regard to their exorbitant rents. I must say they are putting a very valuable class of the community in a position which is invidious in the extreme. There are hundreds of small farms of the kind I have mentioned in the colony-dairy farms, market gardens, vegetable gardens-individually of no great extent of land, but always held at the maximum rent which can be extorted. There Mr. Tanner rentals running from £6 upwards per acre, but I can give rentals of suburban holdings within my own knowledge at £7 per acre per annum, and in nearly all the short-dated leases, running for five to six and seven years, there is a stipulation to the effect that the tenants shall be responsible for all local rates. Well, pass this Bill and the result will be that these unfortunate tenants, having made themselves responsible, will for the remainder of their terms be in the position of having to pay rates which will at least be doubled, and in some cases may be even trebled or quadrupled. There is no provision in the Bill by which they can deduct that unexpectedly increased rate from the exorbitant rental which they give to the landlord. Sir, we want a Bill compiled with a better knowledge of the subject than this one shows, or we need the insertion of some clause or other which will relieve the tenant, who at this moment is responsible for everything, from bearing a heavier burden than he is doing at the present time. As to talking about reaching the "fat man" in this way, that is the most ridiculous rubbish I have heard in the House. The "fat man" simply strokes his distended stomach with satisfaction, while the unfortunate tenant has to pay an ad- ditional sum of money extorted from him by the operation of the Bill ; and the " fat man " knows that every day the land is increasing in value without any effort of his, and without the payment of a single penny towards this increased charge. The " fat man " is waiting for the time when he will subdivide the whole farm into small building sections, and pocket the whole of the unearned increment. That is the way this House is getting at the " fat man," by carrving a Bill so seant and bare of detail as this. Major STEWARD (Waitaki) .- Sir, it is my desire also to say a few words before the second reading is put. The Bill which is now before the House practically consists of two pro- One is that the rating on unim- positions. proved values system shall be compulsorily adopted all over the colony, and the other is that it shall be optional to the local governing bodies, when it is so adopted, to make it apply to certain classes of rates which were exempted by section 20 of the original Act. Now, Sir, I doubt very much the wisdom of attempting to force the system of rating on the unimproved value upon every part of the colony alike. As often as we have had attempts to bring within the compass of a clause or two provisions which apply to all parts of the colony alike, so often have we failed ; because, as those of us who are old members of the House know well. the circumstances differ so very widely in different parts of New Zealand that it is almost im- possible to pass an Act having general ap- plication without making it elastic enough to enable it to be stretched to meet the case of particular localities. Now, Sir, if this Act passes-I speak as regards the first proposition-we shall go counter to all our experience in the past, and, notwithstanding the difficulties we have always experienced in 
<page:283>
Zealand alike, we shall insist upon that very thing being done. Now, I ask why that should be so in relation to this particular matter. Surely the provisions of the original Act, read together with the amending Act, are sufficiently easy to enable every part of the colony to adopt the system of rating on the unimproved value if it so thinks fit. As a matter of fact, the honourable member for Bruce has shown what is the fact : that in a very large majority of the instances where polls have been taken this system has been adopted. Well, then, it is therefore evidently probable that, in the course of a very short time a large majority of the local governing districts of New Zealand will have adopted the Act. Then, Sir, I could understand, if, say, three-quarters of New Zea- land were under the operation of the system of rating on the unimproved values, the Go- vernment bringing down a provision to make it compulsory, in order that there should be uniformity, and that the minority should be brought into line with the majority. But, Sir, as matters now stand it is only in a minority of instances that the unimproved value system has been adopted, and there is ample power for every part of the colony to adopt that system if it so desires. Indeed, I believe it will not be very long before a large majority of the local government districts in the colony do so adopt it. Therefore I cannot see that there is any justification for the first proposal of the Bill-that is to say, to override the discre- tion of the people, and to insist upon them,  whether they like it or not, adopting this system. With regard to the second proposal- namely, that when the rating on the unim- proved value system has been by this Act brought into operation all over the colony there shall remain an option to the local governing bodies to bring all classes of rates under it or not-I mean the classes of rates referred to in section 20 of the original Act-I think, Sir, that in this respect the honourable gentleman is inconsistent with himself, that the second is inconsistent with his first proposition. If he desires that the system of rating on the unim- proved values should be compulsorily applied, then, Sir, I think he should have gone the length of making it compulsory as regards every class of rates-that he ought not first of -all to make the system compulsory throughout the c .lony, and then retain the optional clauses in regard to the class of rates mentioned in section 20-namely, gas rates, hospital rates, waterworks rates, electric light rates, sewage rates, chari- table aid rates, and so on. What I think should be done is this: that subsection (1) of clause 1, which proposes to make the system compul- sory throughout New Zealand, should be struck out, and that subsection (2) should be altered, simply to the effect of the repeal of section 20 of the original Act. It would then follow that whenever the system of rating on the unim- proved value was adopted in any district that system would apply to all classes of rates in that district ; and when the ratepayers go to the poll on the question of the adoption of this knowing that they were voting for or against a system which would be applied to all classes of rates in their district. Now, Sir, I wish to allude to one other point, and that is this : that whereas the intention of the rating on the un- improved value system is to discourage the holding of land for speculative purposes, its: operation necessarily is to increase relatively the rating upon unimproved land and unoc- cupied land. Now, that may be all very well,. and, I believe, right within certain boundaries, to the extent that it discourages holding land for speculative purposes; but, while that is so, yet, Sir, this system operates prejudicially in respect to certain other lands which cannot by any possibility be used for building purposes. I allude to such lands as agricultural and pas- toral associations' reserves for showgrounds, racecourses, et cetera. It is impossible to suppose that the intention of the Legislature is to compel lands of that sort to be built upon. These lands would, indeed, be of no use whatever for the special purposes for which they are intended if they were built upon. The same thing applies to cricket- grounds and all grounds used for public recreation purposes ; and how largely the rating on the unimproved value system has increased the rates upon such properties may be instanced by one or two cases in my own district. In fact, my attention has been drawn to this state of things : In the neighbourhood of Waimate there is a reserve held as a showground by the Agricultural and Pastoral Association. On this showground the Association paid, under the old rating system, 18s. per annum, and they are now paying, under the rating on unim- proved value system, which has been adopted in the district, the sum of $4 8s. 7d. per annum. Then, as regards the racecourse, the trustees paid, under the old system, $2 10s. per annum, and they are now called upon to pay no less than $20 10s. 10d. per annum, or nearly ten times as much. An Hon. MEMBER .- Why should they not ? Major STEWARD .- I think it is not at all desirable that they should be called upon to pay so much ; and, moreover, the local governing body does not think so either-in fact, it is, I understand, quite willing to forego the addi- tional rate. I hope that such cases will be adjusted by some such clause as I have given notice of-namely, that where the rating on the unimproved value system is in operation public reserves and lands which are used solely for purposes of public convenience and advantage should be exempt from rating. This would not make much difference to the total rates of the local governing bodies ; and when the Bill is going through Committee I shall endeavour to add a clause to give effect to what I desire. But I think the Government would do well to with- draw that portion of the Bill which proposes to make the system compulsory throughout New Zealand, and to restrict its scope to the making the system operative where the unimproved value system is adopted in respect to rates of every kind. 
<page:284>
give a silent vote on this important matter, and I may say at once that I object to the compul- sory clauses of this Bill. I have been identified for more than thirty years with local govern- ment in New Zealand, and I have been for twenty-eight years consecutively the chairman of a local body. I have studied this question in all its phases, and ever since land-taxation has been in vogue, and I must say that I am a be- liever in the old Act ; and I think we cannot do better than let that Act stand, leaving it per- missive and optional with local bodies whether they wish to apply the unimproved rating system or not. There can be no doubt that in the case of those speculators in land who buy large tracts of unimproved land in different parts of the colony, and hold them until they can get a higher value for them by the process of settle- ment and the making of roads adjoining such blocks, thereby bringing about higher values and enabling them to sell such lands at much advanced prices, it would be a good thing if they could be made to pay heavier local rates on their lands, and I would like to see a law passed to compel such men to pay heavier taxation ; but I consider that it is the duty of this House to legislate in such a way as to do the greatest good to the greatest number, and therefore I am satisfied that in actual working the rating on unimproved value system will be found not to be of the greatest good to the greatest number, and in many cases the Act will be practically inoperative. The honour- able member for Bruce gave instances of a poor man holding an allotment, and who, it is stated, would pay more in rates as compared with what he pays now because his improvements are of more value than the allotment ; and I know plenty of instances where such a man has bought an allotment and he has gone on saving from the results of his labour, so that in a few years hence he will be able to put up a little house, and then that man will pay more than he does now under the old system. In fact, looking at the question from all sides, there is not the slightest doubt but that those who are best able to pay the local taxation will get off, taking them collectively, with less rating. Take, for instance, a local body where the rates amount to $1,000 a year -that is, so-much in the pound on the selling value of the property. Well, if you rate upon the unimproved value you will have to make up that $1,000 somehow. in order to be able to carry on the work of the district, and therefore in some instances the rating on the unimproved value will have to be double and treble what it is now, in order to make up the amount so re- quired. Take the case of a back district where there are a number of struggling settlers, who have only been able to make a limited amount of improvements. In the case of a settler just starting on his land his first consideration is to get that land improved and under cultivation, and a good dwellinghouse and outbuildings are the last things he thinks about. But many of his neighbours who have now reached a good position, and are well-to-do, will, under the refund of rates, or a reduction of rates, while the struggling settler I have referred to will have to pay double the rates he is paying now ; in fact, any one who has studied the whole question from beginning to end must come to this conclusion-that the poor will have to pay the same taxation as the well-to-do, and there- fore I say that, while in some instances it would be beneficial to rate on the unimproved value system, it should be left to the people to say what class of rating would suit them best and what they would prefer. The Premier is continually telling us to "trust the people," and I think that, in regard to the method of taxation the people deshe, the right honourable gentleman and those who support him and speak as he does would be quite right in doing so. Why, Sir, it is only a short time ago that we heard anything at all about the rating on unimproved value system, and therefore until we have had more experience in the working of the system we had better not make the Act compulsory. Let us show, before we ask the colony to adopt this Act in toto and make it compulsory, that there are a large number of local bodies who have adopted the system with beneficial results. Surely we can afford to wait a few years until the people on their own motion have pronounced whether it is a good or a bad principle to apply to local taxation. I intend to vote against the Bill because of the compulsory principle it con- tains, as I am quite satisfied with the matter as it stands at present, the people being allowed to judge for themselves as to the wisdom or otherwise of putting on this form of taxation. and having the power to introduce it if they so desire. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) .- I listened with great attention to the admirable speech of the honourable member for Bruce, which had the effect of convincing me that I ought to vote in favour of the Bill. I say "admirable speech " because it was an admirable speech from the honourable gentleman's point of view. He holds a fixed position in regard to land owner- ship and land taxation, from which neither dynamite nor wild horses will ever shift him. The honourable gentleman holds most pro- nounced views on the land question, and refuses absolutely to see that there are two sides to the question. Now. any man who travels through this country -- and I suppose the honourable member for Bruce travels as much as any of us- must see the injury and injustice caused by the existing form of taxation. I do not suppose the large towns will suffer much in consequence of the change proposed in the Bill, nor do I suppose the country districts will materially suffer, for, as the honourable mem- ber for Christchurch City (Mr. Ell) has shown, there are inequalities in the existing valuation system which the Bill will equalise and render more just all round. In the case of some per- sons their rates will be increased, and in the case of other persons their rates will be corre- spondingly reduced. Now, if one wants to see the evils and the injustice of the present system 
<page:285>
for the purpose of argument, that the southern members know more about their own districts than we do. But I would like to take some of these hide-bound Tories, some of these hard- and-fast gentlemen who hold unmovable ideas on the subject of land-taxation, to some districts in this Island, and I would not take them further than the boundaries of the district represented by the honourable member for Masterton. In the case of one township in that district-and I can mention the cases of two or three townships, including the Township of Waipawa --- can be seen the injurious results of the monopoly of land by the gentlemen whom the honourable member for Avon de- signates " fat men." Mr. TANNER .- I did not give them that name. Mr. FISHER .- At any rate, there you will see one specimen of that kind of monopoly-one person owning one-third of the township, and keeping it back from all possibility of prosperity, or progress, or advancement. Mr. HORNSBY .-- Eketahuna. Mr. FISHER .- It is the very spot I have in my mind's eye. Since the honourable member for Wairarapa has mentioned it, Eketahuna is the very township I mean. As I say, one man owns about one-third of the township. If the people want to lease any of his land he asks an exorbitant rental. His land occupies nearly the whole of one side of Eketahuna, and that is the busiest side of the township. If a person wants to buy, he will not sell on any  terms. And so the township is kept back. Now, there is one illustration. I know of other towns similarly situated - Waipawa being a notable instance-where the operations of this Bill would be beneficial in the interest of those persons who are most concerned in the welfare and progress of the district, as that welfare and progress naturally beneficially affect the larger number of the population who live there. Mr. MASSEY. - Who is the landowner to whom you have referred ? Mr. FISHER. -- There is no need for conceal- ment : the landowner is Mr. T. C. Williams. Well, that is as to the townships. Now, it is only by means of the passing of such a measure as this that you can get at the speculator in a township, and also at the larger speculators who hold large areas of land in the country districts. We have men in this city-large capitalists who invest in country lands waiting for a rise in price --- waiting for the increased increment which is brought about by the labour, the industry, and the enterprise of other men. Mr. MORRISON .- And they have burnt their fingers. Mr. FISHER .- Not very often in the North Island, whatever the experience of the South may be. I said just now that I would not speak of things I did not understand, and so I will not speak of the state of affairs in the South Island. There is no man in the North Island-at least, if the honourable mem- ber for Caversham knows any man, capitalist would like him to mention his name. Mr. MASSEY .- I can mention some. Mr. FISHER .- Oh, I suppose we will get the Piako Swamp and Patetere directly. We know all about that too. Let us, then, take the case of the Piako Swamp and Patetere : did those gentlemen -- An Hon. MEMBER .- And Matamata. Mr. FISHER .- Very well, Matamata too. Put the three of them together. Pardon me one moment. The honourable gentleman has started this argument : let me finish it. We will take Piako, Patetere, and Matamata, and we will take the member for Franklin's re- presentation-I suppose this will be his repre- sentation since he supplied the instances - that these gentlemen took up Patetere, Piako, and Matamata, and deliberately went in for those investments for the purpose of losing money in it. An Hon. MEMBER .- They did not think they would lose it. Mr. FISHER .- I understood the member for Franklin to suggest that their deliberate design in taking up this land was to sink a lot of money in these estates to lose it. They lost their money in the way that others who took up land in the South Island lost theirs. I will mention one or two cases in the South Island. There were two well-known old Can- terbury residents who had one station each, but one station each was not enough for them, The earth-hunger was too strong on them, so they must have two stations each. As a result they both went through the Bankruptcy Court. Was that result not brought about through their grasping greed ? They had not enough land when they were doing well and prospering and enjoying the fat of the land. An Hon. MEMBER .- Who were they ? Mr. FISHER .- They were among the landed aristocracy of Canterbury. I do not want to mention their names. I will mention the son of one, who in this House railed at and de- nounced every man who owned an acre of land. He politely called them "social pests." That was the Hon. W. P. Reeves, the rampant Radical ; but now the Hon. W. P. Reeves owns five thousand acres of his own. Mr. SYMES .- Where does he own it ? Mr. FISHER .- Somewhere about the Mokau country. An Hon. MEMBER .- It is only leased. Mr. FISHER .- Well, that, I believe, is so, but it only shows that these unsuccessful land- grabbers who "bust up " and become howling democrats only become democrats to elevate themselves on a political pedestal by means of the labour-men's votes, when they revert to their original standing as a land-grabbing aris- tocracy. That is the case of the Hon. W. P. Reeves. Now, I think the rating on the unim- proved value would touch up these gentlemen. They are just the men who ought to be touched up. I am content to cast my vote for the second reading of this Bill, and I sincerely hope it will become the law of the land, so as to put

in the case of Eketahuna. Mr. G. J. SMITH (Christchurch 3.30. City) .- Sir, I think the speech we have just listened to affords a very excellent argument in favour of retaining our present legislation. The honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) has pointed out in the case of Eke- tahuna, and two or three other places in the North Island, the desirability of having rating there on the unimproved value. Well, Sir, the process is very simple. All they have to do is to comply with the requirements of the Act of 1896, take a poll of the ratepayers in the dis- triet, and have their rating done on the un- improved value, and if they can convince the required number of ratepayers in the locality that it will be to their interests no doubt they I listened with great will carry the poll. attention to the speech of the honourable mem- ber for Bruce, who put the case very clearly indeed. Any member of the House who takes an interest in the rating question, and goes through the cities, will find that in many streets on one side there will be large and im- posing business premises, while on the other side of the street will be found premises that are not worth, possibly, one-tenth of the value ; and yet under the provisions of this Bill the rating on each side of the street will be practically the same. Now, with such inequali- ties it will be manifestly unfair for this House to pass a Bill which will declare that rating on the unimproved value shall be the law of the land and applicable to every borough, every county, and every road district. Why, take  Christchurch : my colleague Mr. Ell has in- stanced that. I know street after street in Christchurch where, on one side of the street, there are buildings worth thousands of pounds, while on the other side of the street you could buy up the premises wholesale for about a tenth of what the premises opposite would fetch. An Hon. MEMBER. - This Bill would cure that. Mr. G. J. SMITH .- You mean that there would be more buildings put up on the other side of the street, I suppose. But the buildings are not wanted. I am speaking now of what I know. and I say in Christchurch at the present time the premises there are quite large enough for the business that is being done. If you attempt by passing legislation of this sort to force a man to spend money in putting up buildings that are really not wanted, you will depreciate the value of those buildings already erected, and bring about a state of depression that, in Christchurch at any rate, we do not want. Listening to the speech of the honourable member for Avon just now, I thought he also put the case very clearly. All round about the City of Christ- church we have sections of an area of about five acres that have practically no improvements upon them at all worth considering, and yet the owners of these sections under this Bill will have to bear the taxation that is put on the land generally in that locality. Take Woolston, Mr. Fisher member for Lyttelton: I say in that district there are several factories which under this Bill will largely escape taxation, and extra taxation will be thrown upon the small settlers in the locality to make up the deficiency caused by the exemption of improvements. I am as- tonished that the Government should have introduced such a Bill. We have passed a Referendum Bill, and have been talking " refer- endum " in this House for some years past. and yet this Bill is practically to prevent the referring of this question to the ratepayers of the districts interested. My friend the honour- able member for Christchurch City (Mr. Ell) supports the referendum, and vet he votes for a Bill like this, which takes away from the ratepayers the right to say how they shall tax themselves. It is absolutely illogical. and I am astonished that he should take up the attitude he does. Then, we have heard a good deal about the speculators from the honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher), who asserts that the land speculators are the men who have made all the money. Well, there have been some men who have made money out of land speculation, but I say that for every one or two who have made money there have been ten who have lost it. Mr. LAURENSON .- Nonsense. Mr. G. J. SMITH. - I am astonished at the honourable member for Lyttelton-that he should say " Nonsense." I always looked upon the honourable member as a cool, hard- headed Scotchman, who knew what he was talking about. Let the honourable member go to Canterbury, and if he cares to make inquiry he will find that what I am stating is correct. I am not confining my remarks to the specu- lator who goes in for big blocks of land ; be- cause I venture to say that we in New Zealand have all been touched with the land-speculation fever, and I suppose we have all had a little experience, and the majority of us have lost by the speculation we have indulged in. I say to try and get at one or two speculators, and thereby injure the great bulk of the popu- lation, would be as manifestly unfair as it is possible for legislation to be. I hope. when this Bill comes to be voted upon. this House will decide that the present permissive system is the best, is fair and just, and will insist on its being retained on the statute book. With regard to the remarks of the honourabie member for Waitaki, he said he would vote for the second reading although he did not approve of it, and that when the Bill got into Com- mittee he would endeavour to make it more stringent than it is at present. It seems to me that the honourable gentleman requires some ingenuity to make his two positions agree. When I read this Bill, Sir, I came to the con- clusion it had been introduced at the request of some society-that a little pressure had been brought to bear upon the Government, and that the Premier had agreed to introduce the Bill. But, having introduced it, he considers he has fulfilled his promise, and he now hopes the House will kill it. I intend to do in this 
<page:287>
and I shall accordingly vote in the direction of killing the Bill and keeping our present per- missive legislation in force. Mr. W. FRASER (Wakatipu) .- Sir, I shall not detain the House more than a few moments. I feel very pleased at the tone of the debate during this afternoon. The speech of the honourable member for Avon was really concise, to the point, and logical-there is no doubt about it. Very striking examples have been cited as to how this Bill will operate in regard to towns and boroughs. Member after member has risen and pointed out how the Bill will strike at the owners of unoccupied lands in towns and boroughs, but how many have drawn the at- tention of the House to the injustice which this Bill is going to inflict upon a certain class of resi- dents in the country districts? Sir, the honour- able member for Christchurch City (Mr. Ell) ought to know something about the province from which he comes, and I am sure he will bear me out in this : that there are tens of thou- sands of acres in the Province of Canterbury, as well as in other parts of New Zealand, upon which no improvements have been made in the sense usually applied to that term- that is to say, they have not been ploughed. I refer to the shingly plains and terraces. Thou- sands of acres of land of such kind have been ploughed, and it has since been discovered that no greater error was ever made than to so treat such country. It would have been far wiser to have left them as they were. The only way that class of land can be improved at all is by fencing it, subdividing it, and surface-sowing grass upon it. I fear the amount of reduc- tion that would be allowed for improvements of that kind would be very small indeed. Now, #cc-zero in regard to the man owning that class of land, it must be evident that, by so much as his im- provements fall below the average of the im- provements of the district in which it is situated, by so much more will his rates be increased. Why should that be so? I am sure that those honourable gentlemen who advocate this system, while desiring to initiate a system that will be equitable, and remove all inequalities, do not desire to do an injustice in this way. And yet if we pass this Bill and it goes on the statute-book, and thus becomes law, we shall commit an injustice, and a very grievous one, on the holders of land such as I have referred to. Then, again, let me give another instance. To show how extremes meet : The honourable member for Avon referred to the market- gardener of Christchurch. Well, there is at the other end of the pole what is known as the squatter-the pastoral tenant of the Crown. He holds land from the Crown which he cannot improve-nay, more, by law he is not allowed to improve it ; one of the conditions of his lease says he shall not improve it. Instances have occurred over and over again where Land Boards have summoned men for daring to plough their land ; and because these men do not improve their land they are to be penalised . -- that must be the inevitable result. Take the mountainous part of Canterbury and Otago, in- is unimprovable, and the law has said it shall not be improved. Institute the compulsory system of rating on unimproved values in those districts and what must happen? In the counties comprising country of this character the area of the land held under this tenure con- stitutes sometimes a third, sometimes a half, and sometimes two-thirds of the whole area of such county. It must follow that, by the amount you deduct from the improved rateable value of that county-namely, the value of im- provements-by so much you lay a burden on these people, who can neither improve their land nor are allowed by law to do so. Is it de- sired by the House to penalise these people ? I do not believe it is. Yet we are asked to pass a Bill to commit this grave injustice. The honourable member for Avon really touched the crux of the whole matter-that this Bill provides for no differentiation at all. What ground have we to think that, if the Bill goes into Committee, any such differentiation will be allowed? None whatever. If the Bill goes through its second reading, depend on it it will go through in very much the form it is in now. I have very little hope of the House rejecting this measure ; but, knowing as 1 do the injustice that would be done under it, I feel bound to vote against it. because it con- tains the principle of compulsion. We are not asked now to go into the question of rating on unimproved values or on improved values --- that is not before the House. In voting against the" Bill members will not be voting against the general principle of rating on unim- proved values. It is not so. What we are voting against is the compulsory clause, which says that a district, whether it wants it or not, is to be compelled to rate on unimproved values. That is why I cannot support the Bill, and shall record my vote against it. Mr. HOGG (Masterton) .-- I am very pleased to find we have had a good-natured discussion over this measure. It has to me this after- noon been somewhat amusing to listen to the speeches delivered from the side to which I be- long, because I have heard from the lips of professed Liberals as Conservative arguments as I ever heard from the Opposition benches. This is not a question of the " fat man "and the " lean man," nor yet of landlord and tenant. It is simply a question that the whole country can casily understand -- whether we are to re- tain the existing tax on labour and improve- ments, on enterprise and machinery ; whether labour is to continue to wear chains and man- acles at the instance of local bodies, or whether it is to be emancipated. The speech delivered by the honourable member for Avon has been delivered too late; that speech should have been delivered ten or twelve years ago. when the property-tax versus the land - tax was under discussion. It would have been a splendid deliverance from the leader of the Opposition. The honourable member's reason- ing was very cogent and extremely ingenious, and I listened to it with mingled feelings. An extraordinary influence apparently comes over 
<page:288>
power in an Assembly like this. Some honour- ! who hold large areas that they are not able able members are unable to withstand the ! or do not care to cultivate, who are waiting chameleon-like influence of a little power and responsibility. Mr. HORNSBY .- I' is the line of demarca- tion. Mr. HOGG .- There is no doubt about it : it is a very strong line of demarcation. The honourable member talked about the small tenants with short leases and very few improve- ments. Has he ever asked himself the reason why there are so few improvements under those circumstances ? Is it not because the landlord . land, and building houses for their families ? refuses to compensate the tenant for his im- ; provements in the first place, and because the local body subjects him to a penalty the moment ! sheds for their cattle and stock, who put up good he effects them? We have this experience ! fences and employ labour, who suffer? These pretty well all over the country. So long as you have the present system of local taxa- tion prevailing over New Zealand expenditure will be discouraged, and we shall continue to have the small tenants with short leases and very few improvements. An honourable member remarked that in large centres one side of a street is found to be worth double or three times the other. This applies to prin- ciples just as it does to property. There are : provisions of the original Act, in several places, always several sides to a question, and we have heard one side very well argued this afternoon. But I would ask members who have made use ! of certain arguments against the principle in- volved in this Bill to seriously reflect. They will find if they do so that beyond their specious pleas there is another very big side to the ques- i now. tion. We fine a man for breaking the law ; we !  fine a man for drunkenness, if he thrashes his ! wife, if he commits an assault, if he perpetrates robbery, or otherwise breaks the laws of the t will be carried, as it would have been before country : but do we not also fine a man im- i had the law been as it is at the present time. mediately he erects a dwelling, a warehouse, a factory, and introduces machinery ? I ask whether it is just or right to continue to act in this extraordinary manner ? Is there any rea- son, I ask, why we should discourage in centres of population the employment of architects, of bricklayers, of builders, of carpenters, of plumbers, of painters, of glaziers, of workmen : of nearly every description ? And that is what i has received a fair trial, and if it was not a suc- the men who are building in Wellington and the other chief centres are doing at present. i Directly they commence to spend money in this way, what happens ? Does not the local body or the Government send a valuer along. ! and up goes the value of their property, and they are penalised and have to pay a heavy perpetual tine annually for daring to erect a building ? Is that fair? Is it just ? Is it reasonable? I contend that it is not. Why not take the rates off labour and put them : ment has proved the success which, I think, on the land - value ? It is one method of getting a little of the uncarned increment | ment endeavour to make it universal ? What for the benefit of the working community. By the existing process of discouraging enter- prise you force down wages and reduce the pro- fits of labour and capital. You force up rents in the same proportion. Then, Sir, with regard to the farmers : If we take the country and leave the towns altogether, who are the men Mr. Hogg for roads to be made, bridges to be built, and all kinds of improvements to go on all round them -- waiting till the population cries aloud for elbow-room owing to the congestion in the cities, and until the value of the land is enormously forced up? Are these men penalised, or do they escape taxation ? Will it be denied that they escape their fair share of local taxation, or that the men who are penalised are the small farmers who are making improvements, residing on the Is it not men of a kind, generous, and enter- I prising disposition, who build good outhouses and men are penalised in proportion to the amount of money and labour they spend upon their hold- ings. These are the people who are chiedy taxed by the local bodies. There is no novelty about this proposal ; the Bill merely proposes to make the system universal. We have had a trial of it now in New Zealand for several years. It has been optional for the ratepayers to bring it into force : but, unfortunately, owing to the such as Masterton, a borough in part of my electorate, although nearly every one who voted at all voted in favour of it, the number of votes was not sufficient to carry the system into operation. An Hon. MEMBER .- That is not the case Mr. HOGG .- No, it is not the case now ; and I believe in a few days it is intended to have another poll taken, when I have little doubt it An Hon. MEMBER .- Why not make it com- pulsory ? Mr. HOGG .- That is what the Bill proposes. We have had these experiments for a number of years. It has been tried by the local bodies at Eketahuna, at Pahiatua, at Palmerston North. and at Taratahi-Carterton, a district represented by the honourable member for Wairarapa. It \-- cess the ratepayers have had an opportunity of altering it or of expressing their disapproval of it ; but they have not done so in a solitary in- stance, and there is no proposal to revert to the old order of things. I have not heard that in any place where it has been tried there is the slightest disposition on the part of the local authorities or the ratepayers to go back to the : old system of rating. If there is no wish what- ever to do anything of the kind, and the experi- is demonstrated, why should not the Govern- does the proposal amount to, after all ? It is i merely an adjustment of the common burden on equitable principles. I am astonished that labour representatives, such as the honour- able member for Avon, should actually wish to retain the huge weight of local taxation on the back of labour. I have studied this ques- 
<page:289>
land-tax against the property-tax long before I entered this House. I predicted that as long as we had the property-tax in existence New Zealand would never be truly prosperous. As soon as the Government removed that taxation what happened? Have we not been advanc- ing ? Has not New Zealand been increasing in wealth, in prosperity, year by year, simply because the huge burden that was pressing upon enterprise and labour and employed capi- tal has been removed ? But under the existing system of local taxation labour continues to be severely handicapped. It has placed upon its shoulders burdens it is scarcely able to bear ; and yet the honourable member for Avon wishes to keep it in that humiliating posi- tion. Mr. TANNER .- I never said anything of the kind. You are grossly misrepresenting what I did say. Mr. HOGG .- It was a splendid Conservative What I con- speech you made this afternoon tend for is that labour should be emancipated, not merely from Government taxation-that has been done by the abolition of the property- tax and the introduction of the land-tax-but I want to see it emancipated by the local bodies, and the honourable member for Avon says, "No, they do not want it ; the country is not ripe for it." Mr. TANNER .- I never said anything of the kind. Mr. HOGG .- Now, I represent not a city or a large centre of population, but a country dis- trict, and I know how it affects our smaller settlers, especially the tenants of the Crown. What has happened in some parts of my district, where we have a lot of tenants owning from 100 to 300 acres of land under lease in perpetuity? They pay $8 or £12 a year to the Government for rent. and £15 or 120 a year taxation to the local bodies. That is owing to the present system of rating. Some time ago I had a complaint from some of these men, and when I referred the complaint to the Valuer-General, and asked him to enlighten me as to the reason why people who were only paying $3 or £4 a year to the local bodies a few years ago were now, in the course of four or five years, paving double and treble, and in some cases quadruple that amount, the explanation was very simple. These settlers had been working hard during those years ; they had cleared their land, put it in grass, erected fences, built good dwelling- houses for their families ; they had borrowed from the Advances to Settlers Office or from private lenders, and had made substantial im- provements on their holdings. Through their industry and enterprise their holdings were raised in value-in some instances doubled and trebled, and in exact proportion as the value was raised by their labour and the expenditure of borrowed money so were the rates increased. Now, I want to know why thrifty settlers should be penalised to such an extent tha in some cases the rates they pay are higher than the rent paid for the land to the Crown ? These rates have to be paid to the local bodies for the VOL. CXVII .- 18. speculative purposes. How many absentees contrive to get the unearned increment ? How often are sections in town and country practi- cally locked up against occupation or improve- ment, while the settlers around them, by working hard and spending freely, are involuntarily help- ing the owners to realise huge profits. Now, I, for one, am not prepared to offer a premium for idleness, however much the honourable member for Avon and some other members may desire it The taxation of improvements constitutes undoubtedly the offering of a premium for idle- If we are to have a proper system of ness. taxation, we should have taxes that are not liable to large fluctuations from year to year. We should have taxation that, though it may be altered, will be altered by slow degrees. We want as nearly as practicable fixity of taxation, so that people may know exactly the value of their property, the value of their substance. A tax upon buildings and improve- 4.0. ments is a tax that changes from year to year, but a tax upon land-values is a tax that is not subject to these sudden changes. It may increase, but it will be by a gradual process, in proportion as the unearned incre- ment makes the land of more value. It may rise steadily, and it may also go down steadily. But a tax on improvements is one that in- creases by surprising stages. The Crown tenants in my district have been astonished when they suddenly found that they were called upon by the local body to pay, instead of £3 or $4, as much as $15 or nearly 120. Why should the man that works hard and expends his sweat and his money be subject to this kind of penalty ? Is it not often radically unjust, and even indefensible ? The man who sits with folded arms and watches his neighbour doing the whole of the work is a gainer at the present time, but the man who works hard, who digs and plants his orchard and makes a good holding, that man has his taxes increased and doubled by the local body simply because he dares to do it. In another colony I have seen S iss vignerons taking up ten - year - old vines and laying the land down in pasture, because they could not afford to pay the huge taxes placed upon their improvements by the local bodies, while men with huge areas adjacent held as sheep-runs escape virtually scot-free. Directly the local body got hold of the pcor fellow who endeavoured to properly use the soil by planting the vines, for which it was suited, he was penal- ised by the merciless whip of taxation. I have seen vineyards torn up so that the land might be laid down in grass. An Hon. MEMBER .- Disease among the vines. Mr. HOGG .- No, it was not disease among the vines. Disease in the vines was not known then. On the contrary, there was plenty of splendid wine to be had for 2s. a gallon, and it would have paid the vignerons fairly well had it not been for the immense taxation that was immediately instituted by the local bodies when they began to improve their properties. They found it was better to keep sheep than grow vines. 
<page:290>
What I am Shire Councils and Road Boards. telling you is a fact. I have witnessed it with my own eyes. I have seen vineyards torn up simply because the taxes were increased pro- portionate to the way the owners improved their property. I do not want to see that here. Our best settlers are paying an undue amount to local bodies now, and the time has come to release them from their unequal burdens. If it is the proper thing to remove this impost from labour, the State ought to step in and do it. It is only doing the right thing if it removes a draw- back to improvements. I do not think I need say more ; I hope that I have said quite suffi- cient to convince honourable members who are open to conviction that a Bill of this character should be passed. Mr. MORRISON .- The Bill is not wanted. Mr. HOGG .- "The Bill is not wanted," the honourable member for Caversham says. I am astonished to hear him say so. If anything is keeping back the suburbs of Dunedin it is the fact that this rating on the unimproved system has not been brought into operation. There is one thing I wish to point out to honourable members, and it ought to be conclusive, and that is that the system of rating on unim- proved values, or the removing of rates and taxes from labour and the products of labour, is the necessary corollary to our present system of . Government taxation, under which the land- tax and income-tax has taken the place of a property tax. Mr. TANNER (Avon) .- I rise to a matter of personal explanation. I wish to protest against the gross way in which the member for Master- ton has misrepresented my words. I stated clearly enough at the commencement of my speech that I had supported the principle of the Act five years ago, that I supported it now, and that I should support this Bill ; but I asked for consideration for those tenants who paid rates on land which they did not own. I did not use the words that were thrust into my mouth by the honourable member for Masterton, and I can only account for his statements by the sup- position that he was asleep when I spoke. Mr. MILLAR (Dunedin City) .- Sir, I de- sire briefly to say a few words in connection with this Bill, even at the risk of being called "a hide-bound Tory." The honourable member who has just sat down has, perhaps, raised the argument which is in favour of this Bill to my mind, and that is with regard to the man who owns a practically vacant section. But he says that he is surprised at any member representing labour who does not desire this system of taxation. I admit that the honour- able member knows something about the country, and if he desires this Bill for the country, and will confine its working to the country, I am willing to accept it. But, if it is to apply to the centres of population, I am going to be as strong an opponent of it as any honourable member in this House. In my own particular district we have twelve local bodies, and not one of those local bodies have ever prise nine boroughs, the Dunedin City Council, the Taieri County Council, and the Peninsula Road Board. Between them there is a popula- tion of something like seventy-four thousand. To hear some honourable members talk, one would think that that part of the colony was a barren waste, but if they will take the trouble to look up the statistics they will find that the unimproved value of the lands in these places is £2,975,533, whilst the value of the im- provements is £3,691,385, the two combined amounting to six millions and a half of money. Now, Sir, if the taxation is going to be taken off the capital value, as at the present time, and placed on the whole of the unimproved value, then the taxation is to be on the unimproved value of nearly seven millions. Now, let me point out some of the things that have taken place in my own district, and the argument will apply to other large centres. Some years ago, owing to the high rates in town, the workmen were forced out into the suburbs, where there was vacant land, and there they put up buildings according to their means, and which suit them at the present time. But since that time, owing to the increase of wealth among the people of Dunedin, there has been a migration of people of a more fashionable class going on steadily to those suburbs, people able to build eight, nine, and ten-roomed houses, and these have been built in the suburbs side by side with those that were erected by the working-men ; and in the suburbs you will find more of that class of house than you will the cottages of the men who went out there originally. Now, the labourers who went to these outlying dis- tricts said nothing of the hardship of walking two or three miles to their homes, before a large population went to their particular dis- tricts, and now they are to be taxed to the ex- tent of four times the amount of taxation they pay at the present time. Hon. MEMBERS .- Oh, no. Mr. MILLAR .- You can make nothing else of it. If their revenue is $3,000 per annum now on the capital or annual value, whichever they assess on, then under any system of taxa- tion they have to get that sum in. If you take the taxation off the improvements and place it on the unimproved value, then the unimproved value must bring in that sum of $3,000. The honourable gentleman also mentioned the ques- tion of the unearned increment. In what way does the local body get any benefit from the unearned increment? He also spoke about fixity of tenure. Will that affect the land- value? If they fix a low valuation the taxa- tion must be high, and if they make a high one the taxation is low. They must get in a certain amount of revenue. Therefore until I see some stronger argument in favour of making it compulsory I shall support the pre- sent system. It is my opinion that, in this as in other matters, the people will demand the rating on unimproved value when the time is ripe for it; but to say that, because thirty- three bodies have carried a poll to have rating 
<page:291>
other body is to have the same is radically wrong. It is going against the principle we have always advocated of trusting the people. We are afraid to trust them to say what is the best system suitable to their requirements. I think I can speak for the majority of the town members in the House and say that if the honourable member for Masterton wants com- pulsory rating on the unimproved values for the country districts we will help him to get it. The only county we have round about Dunedin is the Taieri County. It is well developed, and there is as much taken out of it as there is out of any county, and I find its unimproved value is $925,259, whereas the value of the im- provements is only $357,259. Now, I leave it to the country members to work out for them- selves how the taxation will affect that county ; and. if that is an instance of what the effect will be elsewhere, it will be seen exactly how the taxation is coming out. I have taken out the figures of all the boroughs round Dunedin, and in not one case does the unimproved value come anywhere near the improved value. These are the figures :- Unimproved Improve- Value. mients. £ Port Chalmers .. 160,463 59,828 West Harbour 61,839 71,430 .. North-East Valley 152,228 104,130 Maori Hill 73,970 99,057 ..

An Hon. MEMBER .- NO. Mr. MILLAR .- It is no use saying "No." What is my own position? I have an eight- roomed house, which is side by side with a five- roomed house. That five-roomed house suits the owner's requirements. He may not require to improve it, and vet under the present pro- posal, he will have to pay the same amount of taxation as I pay. An Hon. MEMBER. - Has he the same size of a section ? Mr. MILLAR .- Yes ; and he will have to pay the same amount as I pay. What will be the result of such a system in the case of a man who holds a vacant section ? He will do better under this system than at the present time, because he will do this: He will find tom- porary work in the labour-market while he puts up a building that will make that land of equal value; but the class of building he will put up will make it five times the value of the building opposite. His taxa- tion is to be reduced for all time, and in that way you are improving that man's position. suburban districts are concerned-and it is there that the bulk of the workers are settled --. they will pay greater taxation under this sys- tem of rating on the unimproved value than they pay under the present system, and there- fore I shall do all I can to oppose it, unless the country members desire that it should be applied to the country, in which case I would support it. Mr. MONK (Waitemata) .- Sir, I intend to vote against this Bill because of its compulsory clause. I could not but listen with a sense of admiration to the speech delivered by the honourable member for Masterton. That honourable gentleman has a few stock phrases with regard to settlement and settlers' improve- ments which he applies to every subject that comes up in the House. He has a remarkable gift that way; and I can only account for the ability with which the honourable gentleman can talk so eloquently, so freely, and so con- tinuously on those subjects, by the words of a writer, who, describing one of his friends, wrote that he was a very nice fellow and very clever, but a faddist, and when he launched forth on his fad he had an art of putting his brains in his pocket and allowing his jaws to take charge. Sir, I do not apply the simile to the honourable gentleman for a moment, but I will say he has a remarkable speciality for talking glibly on this one particular topic with a singular absence of practical intelligence. There are a few members in this House who, I am sure, have got thorough command of the Premier's ear on the subject of taxing on un- improved values, and though I feel certain the honourable gentleman does not believe in it himself for a moment, yet in order to please and amuse them he has brought this Bill forward, so that the House may talk and vote on it. Sir, I know that there are people who have peculiar notions, and there have ever been faddists. I once read a book by. if I remember rightly. Sir Mathew Decker. He died about the year 1749 or 1750. He was in business, a man of eminent ability, and also as a writer obtained as strong possession of the mind of the people in his day as George has in our times. He advocated a theory by which all the revenue was to be raised, with a sinking fund, by taxation on the people's dwellinghouses. It was a theory that took a very strong hold on the public mind at that time, and his writings ran through several editions. But who knows Mathew Decker to-day? And the day is not far distant when George will be put in the same category as Mathew Decker. I intend to be brief in my remarks, Sir, but I know one or two cases which govern my mind as to the manner in which I shall vote on this Bill, and I may mention them to the House. I know of two allotments, each of 50 ft. frontage, side by side in a com- paratively valuable street. The allotments are valued at $20 per foot, or unimproved value, £1,000. One of the allotments has a building on it which is valued at $1,000, making a rateable value of $2,000. The allotment with a building pays in rates £16 13s. 4d., and the 
<page:292>
honourable member for Dunedin City (Mr. Millar), the revenue for the local body must be raised. The two together are paying $25, and the local body will require that that amount should be raised from those allotments by in- creasing the taxation on the unimproved value. At the present time they pay 2d. in the pound ; but if this Bill should become law each of those allotments will have to pay £12 10s., or 3d. in the pound. The unim- proved allotment will pay $4 3s. 4d. more than it does at the present time, and that with the building will pay $4 3s. 4d. less. But this is the position : One piece of ground has a building upon it, and for that building the owner is getting #165 per annum rent. The other allotment, yielding no revenue, belongs to a comparatively poor man, who is trying to save all the money he can in order that he may at some future time put up premises for business purposes upon the land, by which to obtain a livelihood ; but he has not the means to put up the building, and he does not yet care to undertake the responsibility of mortgaging the land in order to erect a build- ing. Sir, is it not unjust and inequitable that the man who is deriving a large income from his property should pay less than the poor man ? Why should the man of straitened means pay this extra taxation for holding that land ? I think anybody will recognise that the system in his case is inequitable, and altogether wanting in that equality of sacrifice of which so much is said about raising revenue  from those best able to bear it. It has been assumed by several members that all vacant allotments are held by rich persons for specula- tive purposes. That is absolutely incorrect in most cases. In this respect this system will abound in anomalies, and will not work well ; and the Bill, instead of bearing harder, as it is in- tended to do, upon land held for speculative pur- poses, will touch such cases but lightly. Iknow instances of right-down hardship which it will inflict on those that are not well able to bear it. Not only is it assumed that all vacant allot- ments are held for speculative purposes, but its supporters go further, and assume that all vacant allotments are being increased by what is called the " unearned increment," whereas we know that the unimproved value has in abounding instances suffered decrement. am surprised to hear honourable members, almost with one voice, assuming that land speculations have been in all cases profitable, whereas it is only a small minority that have been fortunate in dealing with land for such purposes. If a young man came to me and said, " I have got £500 or $600 ; what shall I do in order to use it most profitably and with the best prospects of success ? " I would say to him, "If you have got business knowledge and capacity I would recommend you to go in for trade, but do not speculate in land." The few instances in which high prices have been se- cured for land must not be accepted as the general rule, because it is not the rule, but the Mr. Monk plodder, but is poor material for the speculator. There is another assumption of those who support this Bill -namely, that anybody who owns a vacant allotment can at once sell it, under the pressure of taxation, and make a profit by doing so. I admit that that may be the case in some instances, but it is not by any means a rule. There is another as- sumption by those who are in favour of this Bill : that it is immoral to own a vacant allot- ment. If that is so, what about our future, if all our cities and lands are to have a congested occupation by legislative pressure, rather than wait for the operation of natural laws? I will give another instance which has come under my own personal knowledge in connection with the place where I live, which is pretty well im- proved, and is nearly as profitable, perhaps, as it can be made. If this Bill passes, I, with a few others, will pay less than I do now ; but those of my neighbours who have not made the same amount of improvements will have to pay more. They will then have to pay as high a sum per acre as I shall have to pay, though they have not yet brought their land into the same state of improvement. It must strike honourable members that this is inequitable. My land is in a position which enables me to pay higher rates without hardship, but the Bill will act inequitably with respect to my neigh- bours. Where is there, in this case, the equality of sacrifice which the Liberal party talk so much about ? An Hon. MEMBER .- What about the property- tax ? Mr. MONK .- I did not support the property- tax. Read my speech made about 1888-and there are some here who remember that speech -when I spoke strongly against it. And I will refer honourable members to Professor Schlige- man, one of the foremost authorities on taxa- tion. He denounces the property-tax because of its inequitable operations and the difficulty of properly administering it. The result of this Bill will be to allow men with large reve- nues derived from costly buildings to escape. The member for Masterton spoke a little while ago about the lives of the small farmers, and how this Bill will relieve them. The honourable member knows nothing about the exigences of a farmer's life; how a man may toil for fifteen or twenty years for comparatively little I income, and it is while thus toiling that he feels taxation. When he gets into a compara- tively good position he does not then feel the rates which the local bodies levy upon him. It is during the first five or six years of his work on the land that the rates and other charges press most most beavily upon him. I shall vote against the Bill. Mr. MEREDITH (Ashley) .- Sir, the honour- able member for Dunedin City (Mr. Millar) stated just now that he intended to vote against the second reading of this Bill for the reasons which he advanced -- reasons which must commend themselves to the judgment of mem- bers of this House. The honourable member 
<page:293>
electorates desired this Bill to pass, and if they felt it to be in the best interests of their districts, he would support it. I am utterly opposed to the passage of this Bill, and I claim the member's assistance in voting against the second reading. I cannot understand the position taken up by the honourable member for Waitaki. He denounced the provisions of the Bill from start to finish, but, to my amaze- ment, before he sat down he said he would sup- port the second reading. Sir, I tremble for the passage of the Elective Executive Bill, now in the hands of the member for Waitaki, who appears to have no political backbone. Sir, the member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) said there was a person at Eketahuna who owned about one-third of that township, and he de- nounced him for holding so much land. The honourable member must know that the rate- payers at Eketahuna have the remedy in their own hands. If they are not satisfied with the present condition of things, all they have to do is to take a poll of the ratepayers and rate them- selves under the Act of 1896 on the unimproved values. And if the honourable member 4.30. for Wellington City desires to advance his views let him go to Eketahuna and give the people of that place a lecture on their civic duties, and the provisions of the law on rating on unimproved values. Sir, I was disappointed with the speech of the honourable member for Masterton, Mr. Hogg. As a rule his speeches are characterized by common - sense, but his  speech delivered to-day is the worst I have ever heard. I cannot understand his position. may again refer to the honourable gentleman a little later on. Sir, I believe that distinguished   statesman Sir Robert Stout was the first man in this House to use the phrase " Trust the people," and I have heard that expression time and again echoed by the Premier. I have heard it re-echoed by the members of the Liberal party, and by gentlemen in the Opposi- tion. Yes, trust the people. Now, what does this Bill mean ? It means though we say one thing we mean another. I am prepared to trust the people. I have received my position as a repre- sentative of this House from the people, and, as an exponent of the people's views, I say, " Trust the people." Let the matter be referred to the people. The Act of 1896 is a fair one, and I am prepared to stand by it, as it leaves the matter in the hands of the people who are most con- cerned. The honourable member for the Grey stated there are five hundred local bodies in this colony, and, although the Act has been in operation for five years, it is strange that only thirty-three out of those five hundred local bodies have taken advantage of it and levied local rates on the unimproved value, showing that its provisions are distasteful to the people of the colony generally. We now propose to force a principle upon the people which they have not asked for. I represent three counties -Cheviot, Kaikoura, and Amuri --- eight Road Boards, and one Town Board, not one of which has approached me requesting that an altera- tion be made in the Act of 1806. I cannot this Bill, except because a meeting was held in the Exchange Hall, in this city, some eight or ten days ago, to advocate taxation on the unimproved value of land, when there was an attendance of only some thirty people -- not a large attendance out of a city of forty thousand people. At that meeting certain resolutions were passed and forwarded to the Premier. A coterie of gentlemen who believe in the single-tax waited upon the Premier, with the result that we have this Bill before us this evening. I listened to the speech of the honourable member for Avon. He under- stands the subject. I will go a little further than he went by way of illustration. The Christchurch suburbs extend for about six or seven miles up the Papanui Road, the Lincoln Road, and in the direction of Sumner, New Brighton, and Riccarton. There is a large suburban population. We will assume that an artizan has three acres of land four miles from Christchurch, and that he paid $60 an acre for it. He has a four-roomed cottage on it, and he keeps two cows, a pig or two, and a few fowls. Being intermittently employed outside, he spends his spare time in improving his land. Not far from his cottage is one of those palatial residences that we have heard about, which is occupied by a merchant doing business in Christchurch. The tram or coach takes him there at the expense of a few ponce daily. Under this Bill taxes are to be removed from all improvements in the way of buildings. Wealthy owners -- the owners of buildings cost- I ing thousands of pounds-are to be relieved of taxation, but the owner of that little cottage is to be taxed double. An Hon. MEMBER .- No, no. Mr. MEREDITH .- I say. Yes. The honour- able member for Christchurch City (Mr. Ell) recommends him to subdivide and build houses and therely obtain relief ; but will the honour- able member find him the money? Supposing he could finance the money, could he get tenants for the houses ? We have heard the term " un- improved value," and levying taxes on the un- improved value, but, like the word " Mesopo- tamia,' it sounds well, but, I venture to say, is not understood by half the people. Let me give an illustration of what I mean. Thirty-five years ago in North Canterbury there was a vast raupo swamp, containing flax, niggerheads, and rank vegetation. It remained in that state for years ; nobody had sufficient enterprise to purchase it. It was available to any person for $2 an acre under the land-laws of the Canterbury Provincial Council. At length an enterprising man took it up, and, after spending his capital and labour on it, extending over years, he bad it cut up into forty-, fifty-, and sixty-acre farms, and the market value of those farms to day is about $40 an acre, while the taxable value is about $30 an acre. I would ask the honourable member for Christ- church City (Mr. Ell) if he calls that $30 an acre the unimproved value. Shall we call the unimproved value of that land the £2 which was originally paid to the Provincial Council 
<page:294>
or the taxable value placed on it after a con- siderable expenditure of capital and labour ? It is all moonshine to say that this tax on the unimproved value is not a tax upon labour and capital, and enterprise, and industry of every description. One man labours for years on his farm ; he puts his capital into it. Another puts his capital into a palatial residence, or a factory, and under this Bill is relieved from taxa- tion. On the other hand, it is proposed to tax the man who puts his capital into land. Such men are most certainly the backbone of the country. Sir, I look upon this question of taxing the unimproved value as a myth, and as only advo- cated by visionary politicians. The honourable member for Marsden asked me how I arrive at the unimproved value ? I go back to the original value at which the person bought the land in a state of nature fresh from the hands of the Creator. Now, Sir, what has lately been in operation to bring about the enhanced value of the unimproved value of land ? The valua- tion of land now rests with the Tax Valuation Department in Wellington ; the local bodies have no voice whatever in valuing for local taxation ; and I know, Sir, as a matter of fact that during the past three or four years the screw has been turned again and again to increase the taxable value in the country dis- tricts. I certainly hope the common-sense of the House will show itself by rejecting this Bill. There is not the slightest necessity for the Bill. The local bodies of the colony never asked for it ; and why this Bill should be forced on the people at the point of the bayonet I am at a  loss to understand. Representing ten thousand people in the Ashley electorate I object to the Bill, and I shall vote against the second reading. Let us trust the people, and leave the matter in their hands. Major STEWARD (Waitaki) .- Sir, I rise to make a personal explanation. The honourable gentleman who has just sat down has done me some injustice, and two or three words will clear it up. The honourable gentleman said that, in speaking to this Bill, I had condemned it lock, stock, and barrel, and had then said that I was going to vote for the second reading. The honourable gentleman did not listen care- fully, or he would not have misunderstood me. What I said was this : I disapproved entirely of the proposal to force the system of rating on the unimproved value upon every part of the colony alike; that I preferred retaining the option the people now have, but that I did agree that "The Rating on Unimproved Value Act, 1896," needed amendment, and in this particular way --- namely, that if the system of rating on the unimproved values was adopted in any place, it should apply to all classes of rates. I said I was going to vote for the second reading in order to get that provision in the Bill, instead of the provision which now appears in section 2, making it optional as regards cer- tain kinds of rates. Mr. LANG (Waikato) .-- I have always sup- ported the system of rating on the unimproved value, and I have stated my reason for doing so, Mr. Meredith platform. I have supported the system because it has been permissive. But I have always said that I would not support it if it was made com- pulsory. I believe in cases like this, as in all other cases where it is possible to do so, in leaving the people to decide what form of rating they will adopt. Now, I am surprised that the Government should seek to take away We have this power from the ratepayers. heard a good deal during this debate about " hide-bound Tories," and " Liberals"; and I would ask this House who are the true Liberals ? Are not the " hide-bound Tories" those who seek to take away from the people the power of deciding which form of rating they will adopt ? I am ready to admit that, under certain circum- stances, rating on the unimproved value would be very satisfactory and desirable, and more particularly in newly-settled country districts, where the whole of the country taken up has been alike in quality, probably in moderately small areas, and where the greater portion of the improvements have been made by the hard work of the owners or their families. In such cases I think it is desirable this form of rating on the unimproved value should exist, because under the present system a man is taxed for every improvement put upon his place. But I would also point out that under the present Act, where the people residing in such districts have expressed their wish to bring the Act into force, there is not the slightest difficulty when the people desire it to have a poll carried to bring in the rating on the unimproved values. On the other hand, I think, so far as cities are concerned, it is very doubtful if this system of rating would be satisfactory. I do not think any one will say that it is desirable in a city to have every vacant allotment occupied by a high building. Even supposing the passing of this Act compelled every one who owned an unoccupied section to put a high building upon it, where would you get the people to occupy them ? It would simply mean putting them up and not having sufficient people to occupy all the buildings erected. Now, if the Premier introduced an amendment in the Bill to make it in any way easier for the ratepayers to carry the poll, I should be very glad to support him in that direction ; but I cannot see my way to support him in making the system compulsory throughout the whole colony. It has already been pointed out by many speakers that very few local bodies in the colony have adopted this system of rating on the unimproved values, or even attempted to adopt it. I believe that only forty local authorities out of between 400 and 500 have ever attempted to bring it into force, and of these thirty-three have carried the poll, and it has been lost in the case of seven. Some say it is working successfully in the districts where it has been adopted, and therefore that this is an argument in favour of making it compulsory. But, I would like to point out, this argument is entirely in the opposite direction. If it has worked well where it has been introduced. there should be no difficulty in having it 
<page:295>
making it compulsory. Who has been asking that this compulsory system should be intro- duced? There have been many speakers this afternoon, and they have pointed out that in their districts they have never heard a word about a local body asking that any alteration in the law should be made in this direction. It is true that in some districts there have been applications to bring it into force ; but they are working under the present Act, and if there was any reasonable desire to do so they could have brought it in quite readily. It seems to me a great change has come over the Government and their immediate followers. A few years ago they were the very people who talked much about trusting the people, and now they are the very people who wish to take away from the people this privilege, and make the Act compulsory. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) .- Sir, the Premier in introducing this Bill gave as an argument in support of it that the people of the country were unanimously in favour of rating on the unimproved value ; but, Sir, the discussion on this Bill has shown that whatever may be the case with the people, the representatives of the people are not at all unanimous on the point. In fact, Sir, and I believe that I speak with some knowledge of the subject, I say that a very large majority of the people of the country are satisfied with the present optional or permissive system, which allows a majority of those voting at a poll, to be taken for the purpose, to decide whether any district will rate upon the unim-  proved values, or by the present system of rating upon the capital value. Of course, like the last speaker, I am quite willing to admit that there are districts in the colony the peculiar circumstances and conditions of which render     it desirable that they should rate upon the un- improved values system, and I have no ob- jection to their doing so. But, Sir, when I heard it stated as an argument that because thirty-three districts of the colony have decided upon rating on the unimproved values system, therefore the other districts of the colony must be of the same opinion, I could only think that the argument was utterly fallacious. How many local bodies are there in the colony ? The Year-book of last year tells us that there are ninety-nine boroughs, eighty-five counties, 238 road districts, thirty-eight town districts, or 460 in all, besides a number of drainage dis- tricts and river protection districts and so forth. When such a statement is made in this House that, because thirty-three districts of the colony are in favour of rating on the unimproved value system, the balance of the four hundred and sixty must also be in favour of it, then I cau only say that the statement is as nonsensical at anything I have ever heard. Then, the Premier in his speech went on to tell us that the effect of this Bill becoming law would be to compel property-owners, such as those owning property in Molesworth Street, to erect substantial and expensive buildings on their sections. Well, if that be the effect of the Bill, what is to become of the present occupiers of the second-class buildings in Molesworth Street ? stantial and expensive structures, as the Pre- mier puts it, what are the people who are living in Molesworth Street at the present time to do ? Will it be possible for them to pay in- terest or rent on these expensive buildings ? It will be probably impossible for them to do so, and what are they to do? Of course, I know that the answer will be this: that they must remove to poorer parts of the city where they will not offend the aristocratic residents of Molesworth Street with their cottages or workshops or business premises, as the case may be. Is that what we are coming to? I sincerely hope that it is not, and that that is not what the honourable gentleman intended. Then, we hear a lot about "equality of sacri- fice " in connection with this question, and I cannot understand the people who profess to be in favour of " equality of sacrifice," as it is called, or placing the burden of taxation on the shoul- ders of the people best able to bear it, or of compelling people to contribute to the revenue of the colony in proportion to their ability-I cannot understand men who believe in these principles supporting such a Bill as this. The statistics for last year tell us that the unim- proved value of the land in the colony amounts to £84,401,244, and that the value of improve- ments amounts to £54,190,103, so that the total value of land and improvements amounts to £138,591,347; and now it is proposed to exempt in connection with local taxation improvements to the value of $54,000,000. I cannot under- stand the contention-the object in so doing ; and I say that I have not heard a single good argument in favour of the proposal. We are told, of course, that the passing of the present Bill will discourage land speculation, and encourage the making of improvements ; but will it ? We often hear a lot of people who sympathise with the single-tax movement say, "Tax the land ; increase the taxation on land." But those people evidently forget that land is paying more than its fair share now. Mr. SEDDON .- No. Mr. MASSEY .- The Premier is evidently of that opinion ; but I express my own opinion when I say that land is paying more than its fair share in proportion to accumulated wealth, and the Premier, and those who think with him, forget that the landowner commences by paying land tax, but that is not all- An Hon. MEMBER .-- How many of them ? Mr. MASSEY .- I am not able to tell the honourable gentleman the number, but the Pre- mier knows that there are a great many people in the colony who own land, and who pay the land- tax. All those who own land with an unim- proved value of over $500 pay land-tax, and if of sufficient area or sufficient value they pay the graduated tax. And we have it on very good authority-on the authority of the Pre- mier himself-that he is considering in the near future the question of increasing the graduated tax, and not only increasing the tax, but that he intended to reduce the exemptions. How- ever, I was going to say that landowners have to pay, in addition to the land-tax and the 
<page:296>
great many people whose political creed may be summed up in the words, " Tax the land ; in- crease the land-tax," but I venture to say that, given the opportunity. these people could not make a living out of the land to save their immortal souls. The member for Christchurch City (Mr. Ell), when speaking on this Bill, told us, as an argument in favour of passing it, that one effect of it would be to compel people to ; ceeded to drain the land thoroughly and erect build and to fill up the vacant allotments ; but the honourable gentleman forgets that in every large city, not only in Wellington and Christ. church, but in every large city in the world, there are only a certain number of people re- quiring to be housed ; but, after the demand has been supplied, he did not say what was to be done with the houses which are not wanted. Mr. ELL. I never said that. Mr. MASSEY. . I may not be giving the exact words, but I understood that is what the honourable gentleman meant. He also quoted figures to show that certain people will have to prv more than they do now, and those figures were rather convincing at the time ; but we discovered afterwards that they were only esti- mates of the honourable member's own calcula- tion. Mr. ELL. - On a correct basis. Mr. MASSEY. - That remains to be seen. There is no doubt in my own mind that if this Bill becomes law, the effect in the country districts will be that a wealthy man, who has a certain amount of capital at his disposal, and who is, consequently, able to go in for extensive improvements on his land, will pay less than he pays now ; while the comparatively poor man, who is not so well able to improve his section, would pay   more than he pays now. Take the case of two : coaching firm, who use the roads more than all settlers occupying, sav, 250 acres each, which is about an average farm. The one is a fairly well- to-do man, a man who has got into a good posi- tion, who has brought his land into a high state of cultivation, and who is in every sense of the word a well-to-do settler. The other man is perhaps a comparatively new settler, with most of his land unimproved, and finds a good deal of di heulty in making two ends meet, but who probably looks forward to better times in the future ; yet, according to this Bill, these two men will have to pay exactly the same amount of local taxation. I say the proposal is unfair. Then, what is the position in the suburbs of the large cities? On one section, perhaps a five-acre or ten acre section, you will see the handsome residence of a wealthy man, with, perhaps, grounds beautifully laid out, substantial outbuildings, everything in first- class order; and adjoining this section you will see on another section, of exactly the Same area and unimproved value, the cottage of the mechanic or artisan employed in the city, with perhaps a vegetable garden and other improvements consistent with the means of the owner. Again, on the adjoining section you will probably see a market garden, and very likaly occupied not by the owner, but by a Mr. Massey Bill, these three men will pay exactly the same amount of local taxation. I will now give an instance which came under my notice not very ! long ago. Not very far from where I live, two or three years ago a man who owned a forty- ---- - acre paddock made up his mind to sell it in two 'sections. One section was purchased by a man apparently of considerable wealth, who pro- a handsome residence, with substantial out- buildings, and went on to beautify the grounds generally. The adjoining section was pur- chased by a widow, who manages to make a living from it by keeping a few cows and fowls, and working as only small farmers have to work. Here are two cases which this Bill will apply to; and these two people will. under the Bill, pay exactly the same amount of local taxation. And, Sir, I say again, that the proposal is unjust and absurd. Here is another instance: In the Auckland Provincial District there is a township which was laid out as a military settlement many years ago. Military settlers were placed there, and each of them was given a quarter-acre section in the township for residential purposes. Many of the buildings are there to this day. As time went on, and population increased, some of these sections { changed hands, and are now occupied as busi- ness premises. One of the sections is occupied as the headquarters of a coaching firm. They have a very extensive plant, and a large number of horses. The other sections are mostly occu- pied by working men who are employed on cer- tain industries in the neighbourhood. The point I am coming to is this : that each of these working-men on the quarter-acre sections will pay just as much in local rates and taxes as the the rest of the people in the township put to- gether. There is the fact, and there is no get- ting away from it. Another instance was quoted in this House by Sir Robert Stout -then member for Wellington City-when he was speaking on a similar Bill some years ago. He said : - " Let us take two men- we will suppose, two miners. They have gone into mining, and we will suppose they have sold out their claims to a wealthy syndicate and are now wealthy. They have got, we shall say, $2,000 or $3,000) each, say, £3,000. The one man buys, we shall say, two thousand pounds' worth of land. He puts £1,000 in improvements. He has got two thousand pounds' worth of land. He has got to pay taxation on this two thousand pounds' worth of land. He pays it, first, to the colony, subject to the $500 exemption ; he pays on $1,500 to the colony his 1d. in the pound. Then, in municipal rates, he will have to pay 2d. or 3d. in the pound. In some cases, as much as 5d. in the pound will be paid in municipal taxa tion on the value of the land if this Bill be- comes law. Suppose he only pays 3d. in the pound in municipal rates : he is paying 4d. in the pound in municipal and colonial rates. That is what the one man pays. The other 
<page:297>
which, we will suppose, he gets 3 per cent. in- terest - £90 a year. What taxation does he pay to the colony? Not one halfpenny; he is exempt from all taxation. He is exempt from taxation to the colony ; he is exempt from municipal rates. He does not pay. anything for his capital. Is that fair? Is it a logical Is that not punishing system of taxation ? the man who chooses to be industrious, trying to improve the land, and trying to become a good colonist, and allowing the other man to escape ? And this is to be a logical system of taxation !" Then, just let me say a word or two with regard to the position in the cities. We all know in the large cities -Wellington, for in- stance - there are numbers of buildings, large warehouses, hotels, banking premises, like the premises of the Bank of New Zealand, or like the Government Insurance building ; and I think the Government Insurance building is the type of what I am thinking of. That build- ing, I am given to understand, cost about £40,000, and it stands on a section which is worth not more, at the outside, than .£20,000. Mr. SEDDON .- What ? Mr. MASSEY .- I am simply stating what I am informed, and, I believe, correctly : that the section on which the Government Insur- ance building stands is worth not more than $20,000, while it cost quite $40,000 to put up the building. Now, place the whole of the taxation on the land and it means, of course, that such properties would pay a great deal less  than they are paying now-because there is no escape from the fact that the same amount of revenue would have to be raised-while the burden would fall on the shoulders of the very class of people who are much less able to pay than the owners of these properties I refer to. In fact, instances might be multiplied ; there is no end to them ; but I think I have quoted sufficient to show that the Bill before the House is no improvement on the present system. So far as I am personally concerned, I object to the compulsory rating on the unimproved value, and I object to it because it would press heavily on the owners of poor land, of land incapable of improvement, and on men in straightened cir- cumstances who are not financially able to improve their land, and because the passage of the Bill will bring us just another step nearer to the single-tax. Mr. FLATMAN (Geraldine) .- Sir, from the tone of the various speeches delivered by mem- bers on this Bill, I have come to this conclu- sion : that while the Bill might not be received with satisfaction in one part of the colony, still it is thought that it is necessary legislation to pass in the interest of other parts of the colony, and, consequently, although the Act in force is permissive, I believe that the permissive power begins at the wrong end. I mean this : that if the Premier can see his way to introduce a clause allowing those who object to compulsory rating on unimproved value an opportunity of voting against this measure being put in opera- tion in their district-say, three months prior would meet any opposition. Mr. SEDDON .- I said on the second reading that I would agree to that. Mr. FLATMAN .- Then, certainly I think no right-thinking person can object to the passing of the second reading of the Bill, if that per- missive clause is inserted. An honourable mem- ber says it is permissive now. Yes, it is, but in the wrong way ; it gives the initiative to people who do not generally take an interest in local matters. By the method I suggest it would rest with those who are in a better position to initiate and put in operation the permissive clause. That is my way of looking at the matter, and I think that is the way that an Act should work. Well, Sir, some honourable members may dissent from what I am stating, but still at the same time those who are not in power do not care to initiate these matters without a lead. It is said that this Bill is in the interests of the wealthy. Now, Sir, if it had been in the interests of the wealthy, seeing that it has been in force for the last five years, I would ask why it is that the wealthy have not moved to put the Act into operation ? They have had the opportunity to do that, and I am sure they understand how to vote for their own interest ; and, as I say, the permis- sive clause of the present Act has been in force for the last four or five years, and vet we find the initiative is not coming from the wealthy but from the middle class; and therefore I think that is an argument that the Bill is not in the interests of the wealthy, but in the interests of those to whom justice should not be denied. I would like to instance from my point of view a case of a farmer who has 200 acres of land, and who would probably be obliged to put up buildings to the same extent for working those 200 acres as the man who owns 300 or 400 acres, and the assessment under the present system on the buildings for working the 200 acres will be practically taxed the same as those for working the 400 acres; consequently it must be apparent to honour- able members that the present system of rating is an injustice to the small man. And although my honourable friend the member for Avon speaks of the tenants having to pay the rates imposed on land which they hire in the suburban districts, still I may tell that honourable gentleman if they did not pay the rates imposed they would have to pay an extra rent, for the landlord would look after his own interest when leasing the land. An Hon. MEMBER. - They are not under lease. Mr. FLATMAN .- Perhaps all the holdings are not leaschold ; but some are, and the tenants understand the terms of the agree- ment. They have signed with their eyes open, and know perfectly well they are liable for rates levied on the property. You cannot get at the "fat man " in that way, and the "fat man " will still stroke his corpulent stomach, as the honourable member said ; you cannot get him that way. 
<page:298>
Mr. FLATMAN .- How do you propose to get at the " fat man"? Mr. TANNER .- I did not suggest. Mr. GUINNESS .- He is going to vote for the second reading. Mr. FLATMAN .- Then he is going to vote in the same way as I intend to do, providing the Premier is going to amend the Bill in the direc- tion I suggest. As far as the unoccupied sec- tions of the cities are concerned, I doubt very much whether it would be wisdom on the part of this House to dictate as to whether there will be any speculation in land or not. In some instances these town sections have been offered by the Government, and in other instances by private individuals, to the public, and they have been bought in all good faith that they will be more valuable in the near future. Now, so long as we invite speculation in that direction, why should the law come down upon those people and say, " You must build on your land, or you will be taxed out of existence." I do not think it would be just that the law should compel people to put up buildings that were not required. I think the argument brought forward by the honourable member for Christchurch City (Mr. Smith) was very full on that point. Then, there is another point in regard to rating on unimproved value, and I think the system would be beneficial in many districts. There are some districts in which there are water-races, and which have been declared special districts for that purpose -they have become responsible for a loan to  construct water-races ; but under the pre- sent system a person who is within that district not only contributes to the interest on that loan, but he also pays a special rate, because it is said by the valuers that the construction of these water-races has enhanced the value of the land to the extent of $1 an acre. Now, the injustice of the thing is this : that the rest of the county is not liable for the responsibility of the loan that is raised for that portion set apart as a water-race district ; and, therefore, at the present time in these cases the occupier or owner of land is rated for an improvement on which he pays special interest for a special improvement, constructed by spe- cial loan. Therefore, in many instances, while it would be advisable to rate on the unimproved value in some districts, it might not be bene- ficial in others. If the clause I suggest is added to the Bill I am sure it will be a great improve- ment, and under those conditions I shall have much pleasure in voting for the second reading. Mr. BENNET (Tuapeka). - Sir, I have watched the course of this debate with great care and much interest, but have not got any information that will induce me to vote for the Bill. The honourable member for Christchurch City (Mr. Ell) gave an example of a working- man who was now paying $3 15s. in rates, but who would only pay 15s. if the Bill was passed -only one-fifth of what he is now paying. This ! would necessitate the raising of the rate to five times what it is at the present time, so as to give the local bodies the same revenue as they therefore, be gained by altering the present system of taxation. It would press very heavily on many of the working classes in the outskirts of the boroughs in my district ; in fact, they would be almost rated out of their homes. Many of them have a few sections of land fenced in as paddocks for keeping a horse or a cow, and if they have to pay three or four times the rates they are now doing they will have to sell out and go somewhere else, and those who follow them will be no better off. This Bill will be very detrimental to the whole of my district from a financial point of view. The revenues of the three boroughs in my dis- trict would be affected as follows : Rates under the present system-Lawrence, £278; unim- proved rate, $68; Alexandra South, present rate, £97; unimproved rate, £29 ; Roxburgh, present rate, £82 ; unimproved rate, £10 Ss. And the counties would be similarly affected. The Counties Bill at present before the House only provides for a rate of ?d. in the pound on the capital values, and the local bodies would therefore be put in a very awkward position. I consider the Premier should either withdraw one Bill or the other. He should have allowed the Counties Bill to be disposed of before he brought this measure down. So far as I am concerned, I shall oppose the second reading of the Bill as being detrimental to the interests of the country settlers. Mr. R. MCKENZIE (Motueka) .- There ap- pears to be a considerable misunderstanding in the House as to rating on unimproved values. Personally, I have always supported the prin- ciple : still I am opposed to this Bill. There is not the least doubt that rating on unimproved value is the only fair and equitable system of rating : but I fail to see where is the necessity for this measure at present. Last year we passed a measure giving local authorities power to take a poll on the subject every day in the week, if they liked. There is no reason what- ever why we should not give that measure time to work. I cannot understand why the Premier will force this measure on the House. It re- minds me of an old grandmother who makes a child swellow medicine whether it likes it or not, and when it is likely to be most injurious. Rating on unimproved value is a phase of the single-tax I very much approve of, as being the only fair and impartial method of rating, be cause our present systems are all more or less faulty, partial, and oppressive in their operation. This is the only phase of the gospel preached by the disciples of Henry George that I have any faith in. Most of them seem to me to be cranks, with cracks in their craniums or bees in their bonnets. But they are on the right track in in- troducing and advocating rating on unimproved value. We have had the man with a small section trotted out in this House to an enor- mous extent in this debate ; but we do not hear anything much about the large section-holder. There is an estate in my district containing 89,000 acres, and the rates paid on it amount only to a few pounds a year. An Hon. MEMBERr,-Very poor land. 
<page:299>
land ; and on some of it there is excellent land carrying splendid timber. Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- The local body are evidently not doing their duty. Mr. R. MCKENZIE .- Well, they might want shooting, right enough ; but I undertake to say that if the local body were doing their duty they would adopt rating on unimproved value in that county. But what I object to chiefly is this forcing process, this compulsion, and that the people of the colony are not allowed the opportunity of asking for this compulsory measure. Why should we force it upon them ? The members of local bodies are intelligent men. They have on the average quite as much intelligence as members of this House. An Hon. MEMBER. - More. Mr. R. MCKENZIE .- Well, they may have more, because on local bodies you do not get so much nonsense talked as you do sometimes in this House. At any rate they know what they are doing, and they know their requirements ; and if rating on improved value does not suit a local body, I undertake to say that it will very soon adopt rating on the unimproved value. There is no occasion, no necessity, no call what- ever for ramming and jamming this ill-digested measure down people's throats when they do not want it. The present measure on the statute- book gives them every opportunity of adopting it. There is no necessity to go any further for some time. The principle is working its way gradu- ally, and I am pleased to see it is being adopted. There is no use forcing it. Take the blustering bombastic speech made by the honourable member for Masterton ; was there any rhyme, reason, or sense in the arguments he brought forward ? I venture to say on any local body he would not be listened to for a moment ; but these are the arguments used in support of this grandmotherly legislation we have forced on us. Then, take the arguments used by the honour- able member for Dunedin City. Does he under- stand the question? I undertake to say he does not. If he had, he would have told the House that a poor man alongside of him has just as much use of the streets as he has, and consequently should pay as much for their use and maintenance ; he should also have told the House that the land-grabbing monopolist who owns the vacant section on the other side of him, and which is generally used for a rubbish depot, scarcely pays any rates, but holds on for the unearned increment, and prevents the poor man from getting a bit of ground to build on. They should all pay the same rates towards the making of the street. But, at the same time, they are quite safe to be left to themselves to work out their own salvation in regard to rates. Then, what is the use of putting this on the statute-book when we have a new Counties Bill coming on this session ? I look upon the whole thing as one of the Premier's devices for spending the afternoon ; possibly because he has not got the Financial Statement ready. Mr. SEDDON .- There is plenty of work to do. a kind of which I do not approve. I should have preferred to spend my time to some better pur- pose than listening to the discussion we have had this afternoon. Mr. SEDDON .- A very good discussion. Mr. R. MCKENZIE .- I do not consider it has been very instructive, or very entertaining, or of a very high standard. However, I suppose it has answered its purpose. I recommend the honourable gentleman to reconsider his Bill and bring it down next session. Let us have local government brought in first, and in that Bill a clause might be brought in giving every opportunity required to bring in rating on un- improved value. I do not see my way to sup- port a measure of this kind. Every locality ought to be allowed for a few years to decide for it- self. At present at least 75 or 80 per cent. of the people are against rating on unimproved value, and the Government will do themselves more harm than good if they force it. I shall vote against the Bill. I do not think it likely to pass this year, and I would recommend a post- ponement of its further discussion till we have had the Counties Bill before the House. Mr. LAURENSON (Lyttelton) .- I rise to support the second reading of this Bill, and I do so because it affirms what I believe to be sound principle. I believe that the tendency of democratic taxation generally is now to lessen taxation through the Customs and to put it on to the unimproved land-value -- in other words, in the direction of ceasing for the future to tax thrift ; and this is a sound principle. I was rather struck by an expression which fell from the honourable member for Hawke's Bay in speaking on this Bill. He said we could only tax thrift ; that we could tax nothing else but the products of thrift. Now, where does the bulk of our taxation come from ? It comes from the Customs. The Customs produces about six times the amount produced by the land- tax and income-tax combined. What is thrift ? Thrift is simply economy and saving. Now, the most thriftless or extravagant man who ever lived is the most productive under our system in the way of taxation. If he is a good wage-carner or producer the more he earns the more he spends, and therefore the more he contributes to the State in the way of taxation. Yet we have the member for Hawke's Bay telling us that we can only tax thrift, or the products of thrift. I say that the most un- thrifty persons produce most in the way of taxation. An Hon. MEMBER .- It is the thrift of other persons that enables them to earn. Mr. LAURENSON. - I only admit that to a certain extent ; but it is not those persons who pay the taxes, although they help towards others doing so. If a thrifty man earns 13 a week, and saves out of that #1 10s., and spends €1 10s., we only get taxation on the #1 10s., or a portion of it; whereas a man who earns £3 and spends every cent of it contributes far more to the revenue than the man who is thrifty and saves $1 10s. a week. I would like to draw the honourable member's atten- 
<page:300>
being had ever been able to define to him what the unearned increment is. I will venture to detine what the unearned increment is. We will assume that a man buys a piece of bush land at #2 an acre, and he spends #4 an acre in clearing it and making it fit for cultivation. The value of that land would be $2, plus £4, plus interest on its cost until it begins to return the owner some income. If he sells that land at, sav, $12 an acre, the difference between what he spent on it, plus interest while waiting for a return from it-the differ- ence between that and what he gets for it is the unearned increment. An Hon. MEMBER .- Not at all. Mr. LAURENSON .- That is the unearned increment as defined by every political econo- mist in the world. And it is the unearned increment which the country should get at by way of taxation. We say that this increase in the value does not belong to the owner of the land, but to the State. Then, the honourable member went on to say that the only way to tax land was to tax it on the selling value-in other words, he advocated the principle of the old property-tax. I thought that had been disposed of years ago. The honourable member for Bruce was very severe on my honourable friend the member for Christchurch City (Mr. Ell), because the instances he gave were not concrete cases, but were supposititious cases. say these supposititious cases are just as valuable as concrete cases, because they illustrate the working of the system. However, I am going to lay before the House some half-dozen actual cases in support of my contention with respect to this Bill. I was struck also by what fell from the member for Waitaki. He gave us an illustration of the evil effects of this taxation. He said that the Waimate Jockey Club, which now pays $2 per annum, will under this system pay $20. Sir, what are the facts of the case ? They have got a racecourse practically in the Town of Waimate, and I say that if the Jockey Club choose to establish a racecourse there- An Hon. MEMBER. -- It is not in the town. Mr. LAURENSON -Well, it is alongside the town, and if they demand to have it practi- cally in the town, they are worthy of taxation, and I would tax them up to the hilt, and so would everybody else who has the interest of his fellow beings at heart. I have been struck by one or two arguments of those opposed to this measure. One of the strongest -and it is not a very serious one-was that of the honourable member for Wakatipu, Mr. W. Fraser, who took the exceptional case of the unimprovable land. I admit that this is most difficult to deal with in this connection, be- cause improvements cannot be put on it, and therefore taxation would fall upon land that might not be able to pay it. It is, however, impossible to legislate for exceptional cases like that. My honourable friend, the member for Avon, also instanced the zones of land that lie between the closely populated towns and the country - the places where market-gardeners and others are at work. That also appears to Mr. Laurenson we come to deal with actual instances they are found to be no worse than others. In fact, under this system they are better off. First, 1 will instance the case of a market-gardener in Sydenham. He has three acres and a half of ground, on which he grows cabbages and pota- toes, and for which he paid $125 per acre. Imagine paying £125 per acre for land on which to grow vegetables ! But that was not his ulto- rior motive for buying it. He bought it for speculative purposes. He is now prepared to sell it for $200 an acre ; but until a purchaser comes along, he grows potatoes and cabbages on it to give him some return in the meantime. Then, when taxation on the unimproved value strikes him, he whines about the poor market. gardener, whom you are trying to tread under- foot. Mr. TANNER .- He is the owner; I spoke only of tenants. Mr. LAURENSON .- I admit that he is the owner. Men who hold land like that are not holding it for the purpose of growing vegetables. The end they have in view is to receive a large price from people who want to settle in the zone that lies outside the more populated parts of the towns. A number of honourable mem- bers have dwelt upon the so-called brutality of the idea of making this system of taxation compulsory. I would ask those honourable members if they can tell me of any taxation I system that is not compulsory. The present system is compulsory, but it levies taxation on the fruits of a man's toil. What we want is a system that will put taxation not upon the fruits of a man's toil, but upon the unimproved value of the land he holds. I think I shall be able to prove, by the instances which I am about to give, that the proposed system will inflict hardship upon no one, excepting upon the speculator who is holding the land with the object of making a rise out of the man who wants to buy a home for himself. I know a man who holds large blocks of land near Caversham. Now, in Caversham there are streets only about 30 ft. wide, and in these streets there are a whole lot of poor people living in unhealthy surroundings, while all around them there are these huge blocks of land which specu- lators are holding with the object of some day reaping the unearned increment. I hope, Sir, that some day or other this House will say that those people shall never touch that unearned increment. Sir, I have heard a great deal of talk about the rich man who puts a valuable house upon his section. Now, I have an illus- tration in my mind's eye. There is a gentle- man whom honourable members of this House have heard about, who has just erected a private residence in the immediate neighbourhood of Christchurch. It is said to be the most valuable and expensive private residence in the colony, and it has been estimated to have cost the sum of £18,000. I went into that matter to a certain extent about a month ago, and I found that that man had paid already to the country, through the Customs, on some of the material used in erecting that house, over #1,200 by way 
<page:301>
months. And, Sir, he has not only done that, but what I want to point out to honourable gentlemen is this : that not only had he put a large capital value upon that land, but he had also increased the unimproved value of that land : because as soon as a valuable house of that description goes up in the neighbourhood it at once increases the unimproved value of the land not only on which it stands, but of the land by which it is more immediately surrounded. Now, Sir, since be put that house up not only has he paid an enormous sum to the Customs-surely he has almost paid sufficient to clear him for a lifetime-but he also increased the unimproved value of the land on which the house stood ; so he at once became subject to more extensive taxation than his predecessor did, who lived on that section in a four- or five-roomed cottage. Now, I am going to give one or two concrete examples of the working of the proposed system of rating, and then I will not detain the House any longer. First and foremost, several honourable gentlemen have dwelt on the fact that banks would escape. I will take the case of one bank in Christchurch. Under the system that at present obtains it is rated for local taxation purposes at the letting value of $1,440 per annum. The result is that it has to pay by way of rates to the Christchurch City Council £178 4s. 10d. per annum. The Government valuation of the section on which that bank stands is $15,000, and that section, under the unimproved value system, would pay to the City Council #258, or $80 more than it is paying at present on the letting value. will take another illustration; I will take a hotel, which I need not name, but it is a well- known hostelry in Christchurch. That hotel is rated at a letting value of $269 a year, or a little over $5 per week. It pays the City Coun- cil at present ₺33 6s. 8d. by way of rates. The unimproved value of the section on which it stands is $3,000, and if it was rated on the unimproved value it would pay to the City Council not $33 odd, but $51 15s. Now, I am taking these illustrations because they deal with objections which have been raised by honourable gentlemen-that those places on which a large amount of capital has been expended would escape more lightly under the Bill now before us than under the present system. Now, I will give another illustra tion which shows one of the best effects of the Bill. In the immediate neighbourhood of the hotel which I have just mentioned there lies a vacant section. That section is paying rates at present to the extent of $9 Os. 5d., and the owner is holding it for speculative pur- poses. Under the Bill that is now before the House, instead of paying $9 0s. 5d., it would pay $25 17s. 6d. Now, this is the sort of people we want to get at ; it is on their shoulders we want the taxation to fall. And, Sir, after all, the wise man is the man who so adjusts the burden of taxation as to cast it on the shoulders that are best able to bear it. For in- stance, I may put on a horse's back 5 cwt., ton to drag in such a way that he can drag it along without feeling it. And I say the rating on the unimproved values system would so adjust taxation as to enable the population of this country to haul it along without their ever feeling it; whereas the rating on the capital value is a distinct and gross taxation upon nothing else but industry and the fruits of a man's labour. Now, Sir, I will deal with another set of people whom my honourable friend the member for Avon dealt with, and who, he said, would be burdened under this Bill-that is, the people who live in the zone between town and country. Now, I will take a case in Halswell. Here is a man who holds an acre of ground. On it is a house and fencing worth $100 -not a very valuable place. This is one of the poor men who, it was said, would be ruined under this system. The unimproved value is $47. Under 8.0. the present system he is rated at 9s. 4d., and under the Bill he would be rated at 4s. Take a larger section - a two-acre sec- tion. A man has put upon it a house worth $2 0. 'There is also sixty pounds' worth of fencing on the place. His capital value is $500, and the unimproved value $240- It is a nice, fat, namely, $120 an acre. piece of suburban land. The rates on the capital value are $1 11s. 3d., and on the un- improved value they would be £1 Os. 7d. I believe that if the democratic portion of this House would only carefully consider the pro- visions of the unimproved system there is not a solitary member on this side of the House but 1 would vote for the Bill. Now, here is a ten- acre block, which is valued on the Halswell rate- roll at $640. The unimproved value is $300, and the improvements are valued at .€340. That is not a wealthy man's section. On the capital value system it is rated at $2 a year, and on the unimproved system it will pay $1 5s. 9d. Then, here is a one-hundred-acre farm, valued at $4,000. The unimproved value is $3,500. Here is a man holding a block of land worth $4,000, and he has only got $500 of improve- ments on it, and I say that you ought to tax that man so as to make him put more improve- ments on his place or else make him sell it. Such a man ought to be taxed, and he either ought to cut up the place or make improve- ments. It is in a portion of the neighbour- hood suitable for small sections ranging from five to twenty acres, and where there is a large demand for land ; and, if he is not in a financial position to improve that land, and if he is holding it for speculative pur- poses we ought to tax him, so as to make him cut it up and sell it in smaller sections. That farm is worth €4,000, it is rated under the capital value at #12 10s., while under the un- improved value its rates would be $15 0s. 8d., or an increase in rates on the whole $4.000 block of land of £2 10s. 8d. That is not a very extravagant increase. I am not going to detain the House any longer. These are actual ex- amples, and they show the working of the 
<page:302>
valuable buildings or whether it be applied to almost unimproved sections in the suburbs, and they show in almost every instance, if worked out, to be for the benefit of the bulk of the people. I believe that eventually we will adopt this system. I do not know whether we are going to carry it through to-night or not, but I believe that the rating on unimproved values will actually be the system in vogue all through this colony in a very short period, and I only trust that the perio i may be shorter than some gentlemen who have already spoken seem to wish. Mr. R. THOMPSON (Marsden) .- We have just heard a very interesting speech from the honourable member for Lyttelton, who aspires to be one of the leaders of the single-tax movement in New Zealand, and I believe that we have got to thank that honourable gentle- man and two or three gentlemen in this city for the whole of the time wasted on this Bill. I believe that the honourable member was good enough to form a deputation some time ago to the Premier, urging upon him the necessity of bringing in this Bill ; and, now that his vanity has been a little bit pleased by having had this question discussed for the last twenty-four hours in this House, I think it would be a very good thing if the honourable gentleman would tear himself away from that flourishing Town- ship of Lyttelton and go and take a farm and try and get a living off the land, and then come back and tell the House what he thinks of the single-tax movement, and of land-taxation in general. I would say that there are very few places where the land is more heavily taxed   32106019788246 than in New Zealand, when you come to reckon the load of taxation for various purposes ad- ditional to the land-tax. I have no wish to make a long speech on this question. I have been listening to the whole debate, and I have sometimes asked myself the question why this Bill was brought in at all. Who has asked for the Bill? The honourable member for Lyttelton and two or three of his friends. And then to please these two or three gentlemen who hold extreme views on this question our time is to be wasted in discussing this measure. I fail to see why the Premier should be so anxious to deprive the ratepayers all over the colony of any discretionary power with refer- ence to this question. Every local body in the colony now has it in its power, by a poll of the ratepayers, to say whether their rates shall be levied on the unimproved value or not. Why not leave the people to decide for themselves ? I am not going into the question of whether it would be right or wrong to go in for that principle, because, candidly speaking, I have no objection to the principle of the unimproved value in rating, provided we can get a proper valuation and a proper definition of what is the unimproved value of land. In the large cities I admit it is a very easy matter to settle that question ; because, if a section is not built on, the unimproved value is settled by what it will realise in the open market-what it will sell at. That is all very well in the city ; but go into the country, and Mr. Laurenson Department to-day who can go on a farm and are competent to say what the unimproved value of that farm is? I have not known one officer of the department who can do it. I need only refer to the illustration given by the honourable member for Ashley a short time ago, when he referred to one farmer in his district who some years ago took up a farm on swamp land that had been lying unoccupied for a num- ber of years, which was then valued at 4:2 per acre. He had the pluck and sufficient capital to go in for improving it. He spent probably nearly the whole of his lifetime and probably all the capital he was possessed of in improving that land. He has now got it up to such a high state of productiveness that the capital value is estimated at $30 an acre. Now, who is to decid . what the unimproved value of that land is to-day? Who is to say what assess- ment shall be placed on that land for taxa- tion purposes? Is it to be one of the peram- bulating creatures called land valuers by the Government-men who never owned an acre of land in their lives, and who have been a failure at everything they have tried in their lives ; men who have been dead-beats in every occupation they have been at? Yet these men, having got occupation under the Government as land valuers, go on to a farm and presume to tell the farmer who has worked all his life on the land what the unimproved value of that farm is. And if the farmer does not accept their valuation, these men, having the funds of the Government at their back, can employ as many witnesses as they choose to bring forward, and who will go into Court and swear to any valuation these men may put on the land. That is the position every occupier of the land is put in. Men can be got to go into the As- sessment Court and give any evidence that the valuer wishes them to give-men who have no regard whatever for the sacredness of an oath, and who are quite prepared to swear to any- thing, and I am afraid you can hire them by the dozen for that purpose. And. Sir, they are hired for that purpose. An Hon. MEMBER .- In Whangarei. Mr. R. THOMPSON .- Yes, it has been done in Whangarei, and it is done in other places ; and I say if you pass such a measure as this it is the duty of the House to define what the unimproved value of land is, and how it is to be assessed, and not leave it for inexperienced men and men who really know nothing about the value of land. Now, we will take, for instance, a small borough. There are many of these small boroughs in the colony, perhaps contain- ing two thousand acres of land, while the busi- ness of the borough may probably be centred on ten acres of that land. Within the last few years many of those small boroughs, through the influence of business people, have gone in for loans for draining, water, and various other purposes ; and if you pass such a Bill as this you immediately relieve those who are re- sponsible for the loans of most of their taxa- tion, and you throw nearly the whole burden of those loans on to the small farmers who are 
<page:303>
the position you will find many of the small boroughs in. Sir, the honourable member for Geraldine suggested a short time ago that the second reading of this Bill should be carried, and then a clause should be inserted giving power within a certain time to vote against it. Why, the people now have the power to vote the other way, and why should we pass this Bill and put a clause in giving the people power to vote against it ? Leave the people as they are, and they themselves will decide whether they want the Bill or not. Then, if you bring this Bill into force, how is it going to affect the outlying districts where new settlement is going on? I venture to say, if you pass this Bill making it compulsory all over the colony, every Crown tenant who has gone on the land during the past ten years, and who may go on the land under our present system during the next ten years, will pay at least three times the taxation they are paying at the present time. The old-established settlers who have farms highly improved will be relieved to a large extent from their taxation, and every penny you take off the old-established settlers must go on to the new settlers. I say that nothing more damaging to the new settlers of this colony could be done than was proposed in this Bill. I feel certain that if honourable members will look at the matter seriously they will hesitate before bring- ing such a Bill into operation. I cannot myself understand how the Premier has been led to in- troduce it, and I feel sure that if he had given the matter careful and due consideration he would never have brought the Bill in, seeing that the people themselves have the power to introduce the system in their own districts already. So far as I am concerned, I must vote against the second reading, although I have no objection whatever to the rating on unimproved value. Before we pass a Bill like this, however, we must reorganize the whole of the Valuation Department-we must provide the machinery for proper valuations and define what is the unimproved value of farming pro- perty. Take, for instance, a bush farm. A man fells the bush, grubs and grasses the land, and lives, perhaps, for ten or twelve years upon it. As soon as he thinks the stumps are rotten ho commences building and clearing and putting the land down in grass. I know several in- stances myself where the unimproved values of farms which have been grubbed and ploughed is higher than on the farms where the stumps are still standing. It happens in this way : The valuer, who in nine cases out of ten knows nothing whatever about the cost of farming, comes along and sees a farm with paddocks beautifully grassed and fenced, and the farm, he knows, would, if placed on the market, probably sell at so-many pounds per acre. He allows so much for grassing and fencing, and the balance he calls the unimproved value. Therefore the more a farmer improves his land the more he is taxed. An Hon. MEMBER. - Under the present system. volcanic land which are covered with stones. It is quite a common thing for persons in the Province of Auckland, on a small area near a township, to spend $100 an acre in clearing stony land. The land is little better than a quarry, but year after year they carry the stones off it, and perhaps after half a lifetime they are able to put in a plough. A few years later on a valuer comes in, who knows nothing of the cost of clearing, and he values the grass and the stone walls and fences, and puts down the remaining value as unimproved value. That is the system that is going on throughout the colony. And hitherto I find the farmers -- especially the small farmers-have not troubled themselves in the least about how the valuer allocates the unimproved value and the capital value, for the reason that so long as the unimproved value does not exceed $500 he does not care. But if this Bill is passed, and the whole taxes levied on unimproved value, I venture to say we shall hear a howl amongst the farmers from one end of the colony to the other. Unless the Government are prepared to remodel the whole Valuation Department it will not be wise to pass such a measure as this, and I feel sure, after the Premier has heard the opinions of honourable members, he will see it is in the best interests of the Government and of the colony not to force such a Bill on the ratepayers, but to allow them to bring the Bill in operation if they desire. If they do so they must take the full responsibility. Mr. WILLIS (Wanganui) .- For many years I have held the opinion that rating should be on unimproved value. The time I had the honour of speaking on this measure I urged it very strongly indeed, and I believe I was one of the first in advocating it on the floor of the House something like nine years ago. At that time Government taxation on the unimproved value had only just come into operation in regard to the land-tax. I have never altered my opinion since that time. I am not a single- taxer ; 1 do not go to extremes as many do ; but I think, looking at it from every point of view, rating on the unimproved value is the best and fairest system that can possibly be adopted. Instances have been given of individual hard- ships, and I have no doubt that the institution of every change will show cases of unfairness. But when any system is first introduced you can always pick out cases that can be brought forward on either side to suit different speakers. I instanced then-and it was a strong point, I think-the case of a man with thirty acres of land. He went to large expense ; ploughed, and fenced, and laid out a valuable orchard. As year after year went on, however, he received no return, but his taxation increased as his improvements increased, and it was five or six years before he got any return whatever for the money he spent. This I con- sider a very hard case. But under the system of rating on unimproved values such a case would not occur. What I attach more import- ance to than anything else is that it will do 
<page:304>
difficulty in the way of speculating and holding land idle for increased value that speculators will seriously consider before they resolve to hold land idle for a rise. Take the case of town lands. People with capital now invest in land, and then leave it for a long period perfectly idle, being satisfied that in the natural order of things the land is going to increase in value, because other men will spend money in im- proving and in putting buildings upon their property, and thus, while these are doing good to their fellow - men by giving employ- ment, they will also benefit those who hold for speculative purposes, and who do not deserve it. These progressive men are now heavily taxed, while the others who have done nothing go nearly scot-free, and their lands are improved at the expense of the men who use their money to raise up a business or to in- prove the land. I consider that is not a fair system. I think if any one should be en- couraged it is the man who makes improve- ments, not the man who holds his lands idle, it may be for years, in order to get a larger price for them. Now we come to the case cited by an honourable member-the case of a poor man who is driven out of the city where land is dear to find land for a home. Such a man goes a few miles out where land is cheap, takes up a section, and puts a house upon it ; and then in the course of time, settlement takes place around him, and large houses follow. It is said he would be in a pitiful condition under such a system, as he would  have to pay much higher rates for his land because it has been permanently increased in value. Well, do you think a man in that position deserves our pity? Does he deserve our sympathy because his land has been trebled, or perhaps increased tenfold, in value ? I think, instead of pitying, we ought to con- gratulate him. So far from requiring sympathy, he should be regarded as being extremely lucky, as he is able to get a good deal more for his land because of the handsome residences that have gathered round it, and if the man chooses he can again go afield ; but the difference would be that if he so went to seek a place of residence he would be able to sell his small place at per- haps ten times the value he had paid for it. I think it is not a case for pity where a man finds his property thus improved-it is not a case of hardship where a man is so fortunate as to find his property so materially increased in value. The number of boroughs that have tried the system go to prove that it has been a success. I do not know a single case in which there has been dissatisfaction when the rate has been levied in this way. Surely if there had been any want of success in these experiments we would have heard of it. But there has never been a single complaint of the non-success of this rating on the unimproved value. An Hon. MEMBER .- Have you carried it in Wanganui ? Mr. WILLIS .- I hope it will be carried there Mr. Willis a poor man his rates will be increased through the local body not being able to rate on the buildings of his richer neighbour under the un- improved system. But, Sir, the richer neigh- bour will have the rateable value of his land raised as well. The same amount of revenue will require to be raised, and the proportion of the rich man's land will be increased in value the same as the poor man's land. The unim- proved value will have to produce the same amount as is produced under the present system. Sir, I am rather surprised to find members of this House, who profess to be in favour of an advanced system of legislation that will be for the benefit of the people of this colony, opposing the Bill. I consider that the system we are proposing will be one of the most advanced kinds of legislation we have had, and I believe also it will be a benefit to all classes of the community. I will only ask, If the system has not been successful, how is it there is no discontent with the present system of rating on the unimproved value for the Government land- tax ? At the present time, no matter how pa- latial the residences, those buildings and im- provements are not taxed by the Government. Well, Sir, I consider if this system has an- swered with the Government land-tax it will be equally successful with local bodies, and I think it is extremely unfair that one man who spends large sums of money on improving his place should have to bear heavy taxation, while his neighbour, who has done nothing, escapes scot-free. I will say nothing further on the subject, but I deemed it right to express my opinion on the fairness of the measure. When I hear honourable members say they hope this Bill will not pass its second reading I can only say I hope it will, and if honour- able members have induced the Premier to bring down this Bill so much more honour to them. I did not know the Bill was coming down until I saw it on the Order Paper. I can only say that a Bill of this kind will have my most hearty assistance, and I shall be pleased indeed to help in placing it on to the statute- book of the colony. Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister for Public Works). - Sir, I beg to move the adjournment of the debate. The reason for doing so will be given by the Right Hon. the Premier. Debate adjourned. DEATH OF SIR JOHN MCKENZIE. Mr. SEDDON ( Premier). - Sir, the reason why the debate has been adjourned arises, I regret to state, from the fact that I have just received the following communication :- " FATHER just passed away at half-past seven. His end was peace. " T. J. MCKENZIE." I move, Sir, That the House do now adjourn, and to-morrow I will move a further adjourn- ment, so as to enable members, who so desire, to pay a last mark of respect to our old friend and colleague. The House adjourned at half - past eight o'clock p.m.

Wednesday, 7th August, 1901. Death of the Dowager Empress of Germany-Death of Sir John Mckenzie. The Hon. the SPEAKER took the chair at half- past two o'clock. PRAYERS. DEATH OF THE DOWAGER EMPRESS OF GERMANY. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- On this extraordinary occasion I wish to claim the indulgence of the Council while I move a motion expressive of our deep regret at the deaths of distinguished personages. We have had two in one day, and the motion I now beg to move is as follows : That the following Address of condolence be presented to His Most Gracious Majesty the King on the death of Her Imperial Majesty the Dowager Empress Frede- rick of Germany :- "We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Legislative Council of New Zealand, in Parliament assembled, humbly submit to your Majesty the expression of our sincere condolence for the loss which your Majesty has sustained by the death of Her Imperial Majesty the Empress Frederick of Germany. "We humbly beg to assure your Majesty that our feelings of devoted loyalty to your Majesty's throne, and of affectionate attach- ment to your Majesty's person, lead us to feel deep interest in all that concerns your Majesty's domestic relations, and to pray earnestly for the happiness of your Majesty and your Majesty's family." Sir, I do not think it requires many words from me to emphasize the feelings of the Coun- cil in this matter. The late Empress Dowager of Germany and Princess Royal of Great Britain was born within the recollection of many of us, and was the first-born child of Her late Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria. Her life was followed with interest by all Her late Majesty's subjects. Her great accomplishments and her many charms which endeared her to the Eng- lish nation were expected to have good results in her future married life. We all know that it was a happy married life, and it was one of the regrets of us all when her late distinguished husband passed away after a comparatively short reign. She has had to endure the solitude of many years of widowhood, and now that she has gone to her rest, I feel quite sure that we, like all the King's subjects, deeply regret her demise. I beg, Sir, to move the resolution. The Hon. Captain BAILLIE .- I rise, Sir, to second the resolution which my honourable friend has proposed, and in doing so I cannot add very much to what my honourable friend has said. We all know that the illustrious lady who has just departed this life was the first- born of our late illustrious Queen, who has only recently closed her long and glorious reign. This lady was, I believe, most highly educated, VOL. CXVII .- 19. in all the great political questions of the day, and had considerable influence with him in the various questions of continental European polity. I am sure, Sir, that all the honourable members present deeply sympathize with our illustrious King in the bereavement which has just hap- pened to England and the other European Powers. Motion agreed to. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- Sir, I desire to move, That an address be presented to His Excellency the Governor, forwarding the above address, and praying him to transmit the same to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, to be laid at the foot of the throne. Motion agreed to. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- Sir, I desire also to move, That a respectjul address be pre- sented to His Excellency the Governor, requesting His Excellency to convey to His Majesty s Prin cipal Secretary of State for the Colonies, for presentation to the German Government, the expression of the deep sympathy of the Legisla- tive Council with the Emperor and the Royal Family of Germany, and the German people, on the occasion of the death of the Dowager Empress Frederick of Germany. I think, Sir, that the sentiments that have already been ex- pressed as regards the address to the King may be applied very forcibly to this motion. The Royal Families of England and Germany have been closely allied for many generations- per- haps none more closely than the present genera- tion-and I believe that, with a thorough understanding of each other's good qualities, and a reasonable amount of consideration for the national defects of each country, it is only due to ourselves on an occasion of this kind to endeavour to show that we feel for any sorrows, national or Imperial, that may happen to the country. Sir, I beg to move, That this resolu- tion be agreed to. Motion agreed to. DEATH OF SIR JOHN MCKENZIE. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- Sir, I beg also to move a resolution with reference to the lamented death of our late friend Sir John Mckenzie. His memory has not only got claims on us as an old public servant and an old Minister, but his memory can also appeal to us and to our sympathies as he had been appointed to our body, and only illness prevented him from taking his seat. I am certain that when he was appointed to this Chamber every one hoped-certainly his late colleagues did -- that Providence would give him many years of use- fulness as a member of this Chamber. But the inevitable had to be faced. The decree had gone out, his days have been numbered, and we have now to mourn our loss. It is difficult for any one who has in the past had much private intercourse with a gentleman of so much capacity and with such sociable characteristics- it is difficult for an old friend-to say very much upon an occasion of this kind. I believe there are none of us in this Chamber who have not. 
<page:306>
capacities, and the more we knew of him the more we esteemed him. I knew him when he first came to Parliament in 1880, but I am quite certain that no one who met him then would have ever dreamt that his life was one of those which would be cut short. Certainly when I first joined Parliament in 1884 I never dreamt that his life was going to be shorter than the ordi- narily allotted span of life, and, if anything is to be said on that subject, I have no hesitation in stating that the late honourable gentleman's devotion to duty and the sacrifice of his health and comfort shortened his days. He was a most extraordinary worker, and after he became a Minister never spared himself night or day to get through his work, and, coming perhaps after many years of open-air work, this devotion to desk-work very likely undermined his health ; so that really we may look upon the honourable gentleman's premature death as being the result of his devotion to duty. However, quite apart from that, the honourable gentleman's life-work in the politics of this country has been written in letters that will always live. I can hardly imagine but that for generations to come the late Sir John Mckenzie's name will be con- nected with the administration of our lands -- not only to-day, but also for some time to come ; and the time he took up that portfolio will be looked upon as the time when the turning- point in the history of land-administration was arrived at in this country. Then, Sir, he was a good friend. Some people might say he was a man who knew his enemies and had animosi- ties. Well, I deny that absolutely. He was a man who believed in principles, and he worked on broad principles. But I deny that Sir John Mckenzie ever carried private animosities into   public life. In fact, from my own knowledge, he was the most generous administrator I ever knew, in a department where generosity is appealed to very often. I need only recall to the Council that measure giving relief to the sheep-farmers of the South Island, when they were overwhelmed by the snow disaster a few years ago. I am pretty certain that if he had been an administrator who sought simply to relieve his personal or poli- tical friends he would never have lifted a single finger to help those people. I believe his mind was of a very much broader character. He knew what the pastoral interests were, and be- cause he thought it was a measure of national importance, whether those gentlemen were his personal and political friends or not, he intro- duced that measure and got Parliament to pass it because he thought it was right. I have every reason to know that he was one of the most generous-minded men who ever lived, and I feel quite certain that many people in this colony were really his friends, although poli- tically they differed from him. I trust that the Council will pass the resolution, which I will now read : That this Council desires to place on record its high sense of the faithful and distinguished services rendered to the colony by the late Sir John Mc Kenzie, K.C. M.G., and of the serious loss the colony has sustained by Hon. Mr. W. C. Walker Mckenzie and her family the assurance of its sincere sympathy with them in their bereave- ment. The Hon. Mr. MONTGOMERY .- Sir, I re- spectfully beg to second the motion, and in doing so I wish to say that I also agree with everything that has been stated by the Hon. the Minister with regard to the motion. Sir, we. all agree that in the death of Sir John Mckenzie the colony has suffered a heavy loss. As a friend he was warm-hearted and true. He was a very able administrator, a man of unwearled energy, firmness of purpose, and unswerving integrity. The settlement of the people on the land was to him a passion ever present in his thoughts, and from his purpose he never swerved. He had a great opportunity, which he in a great measure created himself, and he rose to the occasion, and during a long course of administration his enthusiasm never abated. A really great Minister has passed away, but his work lives. His devotion to the great office which he held for so many years will long be remembered, and gratefully remembered, I am quite sure, by the people of this colony. I sin- cerely regret his loss as a public man and as a private friend. The Hon. Mr. T. KELLY .- Sir, it is with great regret that I rise to support this motion, because I have known the late John Mckenzie from the time he first entered the House of Representatives. I was then a member of that Chamber, and I believe there are now only five or six members present in that House who were there when the late statesman took his seat for the first time in 1882. I have known him for twenty years, and have worked with him both in the House and in Committee for years. It is in Committee you can see the nature of a man, in the line of action he takes with regard to public affairs, and I can say that Sir John Mckenzie always knew what he wanted, and if he thought his action was in the interest of the public at large he fought for it until he secured it. Something has been said about the strength of his personal feelings. I always found him a generous opponent. He never treated a man unfairly, and, with regard to his public services, I can say he was a strong and steadfast advocate of giving land to the landless on fair terms, and he will be gratefully remembered by a very large section of the community. It is a matter of sad regret to see a statesman cut off at an age when he is just as well able to do good public work as ever he was. It has been the fate of us all to have seen great statesmen from both sides of the House taken away in the prime of life, when they could still have done good service for their country. We are consoled, however, with the reflection that the name of Sir John Mckenzie will not willingly be allowed to die out of public recollection. The Hon. Mr. JONES .- Sir, the long-expected has come at last. No one who had seen the honourable gentleman who has lately departed this life since his serious indisposition could come to any other conclusion than that he could 
<page:307>
and somewhat anomalous that we should be here to-day to pass encomiums on such a man as Sir John Mckenzie. He was one of those men who write their names on the scroll of fame. Throughout the whole of New Zealand he has erected tangible and practical monu- ments to his memory. But, Sir, it is pleasant to dwell upon the virtues of a departed friend. It is pleasant and profitable too, I think, to look upon those virtues, to glance at what the man was, and to try to live up to the high standard which he set up. Sir John Mckenzie's cha- racter and his attributes were peculiar. There have been very few men who have lived in New Zealand and moved on our political stage possessing similar attributes. He had a strong mind and a strong hand. What he deemed to be right he was resolved to see car- ried out so far as in him lay. When he had a conviction he was uncompromising. There was no surrender, no compounding with evil, in order to attain his object. He was no oppor- tunist. Everybody who has had any association with the honourable gentleman will be aware of these facts. He was, as it were, our political Kitchener, and as I once before said in this Council-I wish to emphasize it now -- there is in the field of our politics as much heroism and indomitable pluck displayed as have ever been shown on the field of battle. As the people's champion, just at a very important juncture in the colony's history, Sir John Mckenzie came forward and promulgated his land policy. At the outset he was met with bitter opposition. Things were said and written of him which the utterers and writers have since regretted, because he has lived down all opposition and silenced all his enemies; and the honourable gentleman would have this consolation on his death-bed : there was nothing left but admiration for his principles and for the way in which he carried them out in the interests of the colony. More than that, there was a time in the history of our advanced Liberalism when things were just trembling in the balance. There was just a chance that the great policy which had been set up by Sir John Mckenzie might fail. Sir, there was just the possibility, indeed, that the Liberal Government might fail ; but he not only saved the cause of those who were carrying out the principles of that cause, but he raised to a high pinnacle its popularity. Sir John Mc- Kenzie's name will last as long as the principles he professed and practised will be admired ; and I do think, Sir, that the world is growing better, and that in the history of the human race we shall yet find that those principles are more and more admired as the years roll along. Sir, though unyielding, the deceased gentleman was never unjust, and beneath a rough exterior he carried a genuinely kind heart. We must all regret having lost such a man, but we should feel grateful that we ever had him amongst us. The Hon. Mr. A. LEE SMITH .- I should not like, as an old friend of the late Sir John Mckenzie, to let this occasion pass without availing myself of the opportunity of making some contribution to the well-merited eulogies honourable gentleman. By the sad event which has occurred I think this Council has been de- prived of services which have been very con- spicuous, and which, to my mind, would have added very much to the value of our delibera- tions. Sir, he has gone. The varied experi- ence of his public life enabled him to render effective those natural qualities which he pos- sessed in forming and guiding the policy of a new country. Brought up as a humble son of the soil, he very quickly came to the front against all opposition, and he became a great authority on all matters connected with agri- cultural life. And what evidence has he left behind him of what he has done ? Take the reform of our system of land tenure, and his land - for - settlements policy, and I think it may be said that he has left behind him almost a peaceful and unintentional revolu- tion. At any rate, I think I may say that in carrying on his work he was first of all inspired by high ideals, and his work has been done with great perseverance and with great skill, and always with a transparent honesty of pur- pose. As a private friend I have known him for many years. I have visited him and been visited by him, and I have always recognised that he had the true qualities of a good, kind, and generous friend, and I shall always appre- ciate his memory in that respect. I saw him only a week before I came up to the Council, and was pleased indeed to find that his health had made so much progress, and he then shared with me the hope that within a few weeks he would make his appearance here. But, Sir, that was not to be, and I am quite certain the Coun- cil will join with me in regretting that is not so. Sir, I take a wider view of the loss we have sus- tained by the death of the late statesman. I feel quite sure that the colony has lost one of its best servants, and that his memory will always be cherished and kept green by those who regard honesty, true patriotism, and devotion to duty as the finest attributes that can be attached to men taking part on life's stage. Motion agreed to. The Council adjourned at a quarter-past three o'clock p.m., until Tuesday, 13th August. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. Wednesday, 7th August, 1901.

DEATH OF THE DOWAGER EMPRESS OF GERMANY. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- Mr. Speaker, I rise to propose the following resolution :

That the following address of condolence be presented to His Most Gracious Majesty the King on the death of Her Imperial Majesty the Dowager Empress Frederick of Germany :- " We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the House of Representatives of New Zealand, in Parliament assembled, humbly sub- mit to your Majesty the expression of our sincere condolence for the loss which your Majesty has sustained by the death of Her Imperial Majesty the Dowager Empress Frederick of Germany. "We humbly beg to assure your Majesty that our feelings of devoted loyalty to your Majesty's throne, and of affectionate attach- ment to your Majesty's person, lead us to feel deep interest in all that concerns your Majesty's domestic relations, and to pray earnestly for the happiness of your Majesty and your Majesty's family." Sir, ere the wounds are closed, caused by the death of a beloved mother, our good and gracious Queen Victoria, of blessed memory, this further bereavement has overtaken our Gracious Sovereign and the Royal Family. It is sad in the extreme, and our Sovereign must have keenly felt not being able to be with his dear sister in her last moments. It will to some extent, I feel sure, comfort and console him to know that those, though far distant in this colony, through their representatives, take the occasion of conveying to His Majesty our sin- cere and heartfelt sympathy and condolence. I feel sure, Sir, that one and all present feel deeply  the loss that the German nation has sustained, and also the loss our nation has sustained by the death of the Dowager Empress Frederick of Germany, and better known by us as the Princess Royal. I move, Sir, the resolution. Captain RUSSELL (Hawke's Bay) .- I rise to second the resolution moved by the Right Hon. the Premier. When I cast my mind back for many years, I can remember the Princess Royal of England, before she became the wife of Prince Frederick William of Prussia, joining in good work, and by her artistic skill adding con- siderably to the patriotic fund for the benefit of the English soldiers, or, rather, for the widows and children of those who died in the Crimean war. Sir, if one considers the memory of Her late Imperial Majesty the Empress of Germany, one cannot but realise how, though she left Eng- land a young girl, scarcely a woman, she con- tinued always devoted to her native country, and how great her influence has been in foster. ing, I may say perpetuating, the feeling of good- will between the Imperial family of Germany and that of England. Although she became by marriage and by life-long residence rather, per- haps, a German than an Englishwoman, yet in her heart she never forgot the land of her birth. Of the people of contemporaneous history it is more than possible that her influence for good has tended most to perpetuate the friendship between the great branches of the Saxon races- the German and the English people - which is so conducive to the peace of the world. Though, of course, not one of the most remarkable examples in history, she has been known for Mr. Seddon sound judgment more than, perhaps, we can realise, for at times of strained relations between Germany and England her influence has always been in favour of the country-not in favour of, but favourable towards the country in which she was born ; and, though it is said in these days that the alliances of Royal families do not affect the destinies and policies of nations, yet it is incredible that they do not in some degree tend to harmony amongst the rulers of empires ; and I, at any rate, cannot but feel that in the death of Her Imperial Highness the Dowager Empress of Germany England has lost a power which has always been friendly and for peace in the world. Motion agreed to. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- I now move, That an address be presented to His Excellency the Governor, forwarding the above address, and praying him to transmit the same to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies to be laid at the foot of the Throne. Motion agreed to. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- Sir, I now desire to move the following : " That a respectful address be presented to His Excellency the Governor, requesting His Excellency to convey to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, for presentation to the German Go- vernment, the expression of the deep sympathy of the House of Representatives with the Emperor and Royal Family of Germany, and the German people, on the occasion of the death of Her Imperial Majesty the Dowager Empress Fre- derick of Germany." To-day, Sir, two great nations are mourning the loss of one who in life has done great ser- vice to both. There can be no doubt whatever that during her life, if we are to credit what has been written, to some extent Her Imperial Highness suffered because of the work which she did in assisting to promote the good-will of both nations, and in seeing that the interests of our nation did not suffer. I feel sure to-day that both nations tender to the German Em- peror on the loss of a beloved mother their sincere sympathy ; and towards our Sovereign on the loss of a dear sister there is only one feeling, and that is heartfelt sympathy and condolence. The work done in life will not end now. I feel sure that this sad occurrence will bring both nations closely together. It is in the interests of the - orld, it is for the promotion of peace, that Germany and Great Britain should be on the most friendly terms. And we in this colony sympathize with those German colonists who are with us, and of whose great help and assistance we can speak. Wecan also speak of how on each and every occasion they have sympathized with us when loss has overtaken us. To them to-day we heartily re- ciprocate-nay, we are bound together, for we are both mourners ; and I repeat this will help, in my opinion, to bring us closer together. In moving this resolution, and asking members to support it, I can only say that we deeply de- plore the sad ending of the Dowager Empress Frederick of Germany. We cannot forget the courage, the fortitude, the devotion of the wife 
<page:309>
mate death of the late Emperor ; and that devotion evoked universal admiration. As the Princess Royal, her good work in .he Mother- country is well known ; and I feel satisfied her views, her aspirations, and her only desire has been to do good and to improve that which was for the benefit of both nations. I move the resolution. Motion agreed to. DEATH OF SIR JOHN MCKENZIE. Mr. SEDDON (Premier). - Sir, I rise to move, That this House desires to place on record its high sense of the faithful and distinguished ser- vices rendered to New Zealand by the late Sir John Mckenzie, K.C.M.G .. and of the serious loss the colony has sustained by his death, and respectfully tenders to Lady Mckenzie and her family the assurance of its sincere sympathy with them in their bereavement. I feel sure that members will sympathize with me on this occasion, because my heart is too full to permit me to be able to do justice to the memory and to the services of my late esteemed colleague and friend, Sir John Mckenzie. We spent years together in this House as private members in the Liberal party, having feelings in common, and it is struggling under adversity which brings out the truest characteristics. Subsequently we were for many years col- leaques together, having great responsibilities, and the tie of friendship was further strengthened until nothing but death could sever it. Sir,  I might perhaps refer to one incident that is now almost forgotten. On one occasion, and in the small hours of the morning, the Waihemo County Bill, which had been introduced by Mr. Mckenzie, was brought on during his absence. It came on suddenly, and the Bill was in dan- ger. Taking up the matter, and almost alone, I fought for an hour, time was gained, and then I well remember his figure coming into the House, and looking round as much as to say, " Who dared to take advantage of my ab- sence ? " And it was not long, Sir, ere the whole scene was changed, the Waihemo County Bill was passed, not rejected; and my distin- guished colleague was the first County Chair- man. It is well on occasions of this kind, sad as it is, that we should, as it were, place on record for all time the valuable public services rendered by those who have been called away. The younger generation of this colony-nay, all those from the Mother-country as well- might well copy his example, and endeavour, if possible, to emulate and to succeed as our late comrade so well succeeded. Born in Ard- ross, in Rosshire, in 1838, he had only reached mature manhood, and that makes our regret all the greater, because had it not been for the sad affliction that overtook him we might have hoped for, as we should indeed have succeeded in having from him, years of faithful service to the colony. Leaving his father's farm in 1860, and arriving in Otago, we find him first commencing his duties as a shepherd. Then, we find he succeeded so well that he was made manager of the station upon from that we find him able, owing to his thrift and care and energy, to acquire a small farm for himself in Shag Valley. We then find him, as many others in our Par- liament, commencing at the lower rung of the ladder as a member of a Road Board- the Bushy Road Board; and in that, as in all else in life, he succeeded. He also devoted some portion of his time to school matters, and was secretary to the local School Committee, show- ing a deep interest in the rising generation, and endeavouring to secure for them that which had been denied to him in his younger days. In 1868 he unsuccessfully contested an 3.0. election for a seat in the Provincial Council, but in 1871 he was returned, and held that position until the provinces were abolished. There are still those among us who met him in the Provincial Council, and I have learnt from his colleagues in that Council that while there he more particularly interested himself in land administration, and the laws affecting the lands of Otago, and that he was ever liberal in the extreme, and ever desirous of putting the people upon the land. A few years later he was elected as a member of the Waikouaiti County Council, and was also appointed Property-tax Assessor for the same district. In 1882 he was successful in having the Waihemo County created, and he was elected the first Chair- man of its Council. In 1881 he was elected a member of the House of Representatives for the Moeraki constituency, and from that time until the beginning of last session, when illness caused him to resign, it may be said he ever represented the one interest and the one people. We all feel for them, because they recognise that by his death they have lost a true friend, a true resident, and one whose interests and theirs were inseparably bound together. I may also say that in 1883 he secured a seat on the Otago Education Board, which he held for nine years. For many years he also occupied a seat on the Otago Land Board. The positions that he held in the Parliament of this colony are well known. I mentioned his first connection with the Liberal party, and how he laboured well and faithfully for what he conceived to be in the best interests of the people. What I have just mentioned to honourable members will show them how well equipped and how well fitted was the late Sir John Mckenzie for the position of Minister of the Crown. First there was his practical know- ledge of farming, and pastoral pursuits; then his knowledge of valuing, and the nature of lands ; then his training on the local bodies- all these qualifications well equipped him for a more responsible position in the government of the country. Then, there was his training in the Provincial Council, the Education Board, and even on the School Committee. I say, Sir, it has fallen to the lot of few to have had so complete and so general a training as had our late worthy comrade, and my friend and col- league, Sir John Mckenzie. The measures with which his name is connected I cannot refer to as I would like, for time will not permit of my doing so, nor would the occasion be a 
<page:310>
brought before Parliament and was so success- ful in having placed on the statute-book. Suffice it to say that first in order we have the consolidation of the land laws of the colony in "The Land Act, 1892." Prior to that time our laws dealing with this question had been for some time fragmentary, and there was difficulty in dealing with the subject ; but he, by the passing of that measure, assisted Parliament and assisted the country in having a concise and consolidated law bearing upon land and land-administration. Then we had the Water-supply Act, and all will admit the very great benefits that have been derived from that legislation. Then, so far back as 1892, we had the Dairy Industry Act. When we look back on the position of affairs, at the dairy in- dustry at that time, and realise the magnitude of the industry to-day, and the great boon it has been to the people of our colony, one and all must admit that a great deal of the credit for the success must be given to the late Sir John Mckenzie. Sir, that credit will not now stintingly be given. Sometimes during life there are those who do not feel called upon or who hang back in paying due tribute to the merits of those who have helped to do good for their fellows, and to promote the well-being of the country. But in this respect I say he did noble work ; and, proceeding from the time of the passing of " The Dairy Industry Act, 1892," we have had in succession grading and cool-storing, and in each and every detail there was no better friend to those engaged in  this industry than the one who has passed away, and whose loss we so deeply deplore. Then we had also " The Stock Act, 1893," and "The Cheviot Disposition Act, 1893," and I can speak in respect to the latter with autho- rity, because I know what occurred at the time, and that any hesitancy in respect to the Cheviot Estate would have caused serious loss to this colony. I say that the name of our late friend will ever be connected with that action, which he fully supported, and which has led to the success of that settlement. Then, there is "The Land for Settlements Act, 1894." There were those who differed then, and who to-day conscien- tiously differ, more especially in respect to the details of that measure ; although I think I may say that, in respect to the policy of plac- ing people on the land, that policy is generally and universally indorsed. But there can be no doubt of this fact : that there are many now who enjoy homes, there have been many who have been lifted from anxiety and almost from want, who will ever respect the memory of him who helped in a great measure to give them their life's opportunity. I leave the question of the Land for Settlements Act, and I come to the Land Improvement and Native Land Ac- quisition Act. All these measures had the one object in view - namely, the desire to place the people upon the lands of our country ; and he lived to note and to see the success and the fruits of his labours. It will be, Sir, in connection with our land legislation, and the Mr. Seddon upon the land of our country that the name of our respected comrade, my friend and colleague, will be remembered. I, Sir, know that one and all present feel that we can never do full justice to his memory in this respect ; but I feel also sure, Sir, that one and all will endea- vour, even though he has passed away, to still further promote that great object which he had in view, and for which he made the greatest sacrifice that man can make-namely, the greatest of God's blessings, good health ; because there can be little doubt that his unstinted ser- vices to the country, his faithful discharge of duty, his leaving, as it were, and neglecting health for the carrying-out of the objects he had so much at heart, has shortened his days. Feeling that to be the case, one and all of us now will do all that lies in our power, and we can do something, to comfort those who have been left behind to mourn the loss of a loving husband and affectionate and kind father. Our minds to-day will be with the bereaved family group at Heathfield. His home and family life was perfect, and worthy of emulation, and bright in the extreme. I can only say, as a late colleague, that in counsel he was of incalculable assistance to me. He was a kind and true friend. He could always give good and sound reasons for his every action, and all will admit that to be the case. Although you might differ, you could only come to one conclusion - namely, that our comrade who has just passed away was sincere, that his honesty of purpose could never be questioned, and that he was upright in all his dealings, public or private. He was one of those men with a strong personality, and though you differed from him you would always respect him. He was respected in life, and in death his memory will ever be kept green in this country, and there are those thousands to-day and thousands to come hereafter who will bless the name of John Mckenzie. Captain RUSSELL (Hawke's Bay). - The House has listened to a description of the ser- vices which have been rendered to the colony by the late Sir John Mckenzie. It never was my good fortune to sit on the same side of the House that that honourable gentleman did; but I trust that, though many of us may have been in antagonism to him in political life, there is scarcely a man - - I think I may say there was no single man-who was other than a friend to him in a personal capacity. A great personality passed from life to history at the death of Sir John Mckenzie. Time will enable a truer esti- mate of his career to be drawn than his con- temporaries can sketch. His was a remark- able figure. Bold, though rugged in out - line, fashioned in grand proportions of the best Scotch granite. In a political world much deteriorated by a vigilant opportunism his uncompromising adherence to his con- victions was worthy of all admiration, even by those who sometimes doubted the wisdom of his methods. Those who may have thought his view was sometimes narrow admitted that his path was always straight. Concentration of 
<page:311>
vision is almost essential to a clear appreciation of an end to be attained. There was in his temperament that mixture of practical and poetic strains so constantly to be found in the mountaineer, and I can conceive that the guiding principles of Sir John Mckenzie's land legislation may have been based on Robert Burns's celebrated dirge, " Man was made to mourn." One can figure himself as the young man apostrophized by the hoary octogenarian wanderer ;- See yonder poor, o'erlaboured wight, So abject, mean, and vile, Who begs a brother of the earth To give him leave to toil; And see his lordly fellow-worm The poor petition spurD, Unmindful, though a weeping wife And helpless offspring mourn. One could understand Sir John McKenzie determining to devote his mature life to re- medying the wrongs that he witnessed in his youth. And how pathetic and pitiful his end. Though mourned by his fellow-colonists and decorated by his Sovereign, he could not be saved from years of almost unceasing anguish. With patience and submission that impatient and unsubmissive man bore all his sufferings- an object-lesson to men of smaller souls. And as his earlier life may have been stimulated by the earlier lines of Robert Burns's poem, so his last hours may have been solaced by its last verse : O, Death, the poor man's dearest friend- The kindest and the best ! Welcome the hour my aged limbs Are laid with thee at rest. The great, the wealthy, fear thy blow, From pomp and pleasure torn ; But, oh ! a blest relief to those That weary laden mourn ! I second the motion. Major STEWARD (Waitaki). - Sir, having been for nearly thirty years the intimate friend and for nearly a quarter of a century the poli- tical comrade of the late Sir John McKenzie, I desire to add a few words of tribute to his memory. Those who knew him best loved him most, and the better he was known the more highly he was esteemed. Rugged and firm as the hills under whose shadow his childhood was passed, his faults-and they were few -- were those of an essentially strong man ; and the en- vironment of his youth not only helped to mould his character, but was destined to have an in- fluence for good on these far-away islands which became his manhood's home ; for the brave, strong man that came to us in the early sixties brought with him a knowledge of the evils of a . pitiless landlordism, and a determination that no such evils as afflicted the crofters of his be- loved Highlands should curse, if he could help it, the land of his adoption. And to him in due course came the opportunity to pass and adminis- ter liberal land-laws, to help his fellow-men to establish themselves on the soil in comfort and happiness, and well and nobly he fulfilled the task-nay, not a task, for to him it was always a labour of love. Of him, as of Sir Christopher Wren, it may be written " Si monu- mentum requiris, circumspice !"; though in his case the testimony to his successful work is not bounded by the walls of any one building, but is borne by thousands upon thousands of fertile acres and hundreds upon hundreds of happy homes. We can ill spare him, and we shall feel his loss for many and many a year. But, though he be dead he yet speaketh ; he speaks by a patriotic devotion which we may all well imitate, for while he "rests from his labours his works do follow him." We mourn his loss, we sorrow for his loved ones, but we sorrow not for him, for "after life's fitful fever he sleeps well." He has exchanged its storm and strife for the peace of God, which passeth all understanding. It is well with him; and it remains only for the country he served so well to do honour to his memory. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) .- Sir, it is now over twenty years since I had the fortune to make Sir John McKenzie's first acquaint- ance, and very soon after that we were con- nected in politics, being elected at the same election-1881-he for Moeraki and I for Wai- taki. In those days there were very few who represented the farmers in this House, and I think previous to our advent they were fewer still. In 1882, when Mr. Rolleston passed his Land Bill, had it not been for the assist- ance of Sir John Mckenzie and myself his own supporters at that time would not have carried the Bill, and the division-list will show that. So that no matter from what side im- provement in land-settlement came-whether in opposition or whether he was on the side that brought it forward-he supported measures that were for the good of the people of this colony. I suppose I was more intimately con- nected with Sir John Mckenzie than many even of his colleagues, after he joined the Ministry ; he often consulted me about matters, and there were very few questions he brought up in the House on which he did not obtain my opinion to see if it coincided with his own. I may say that had he been a less strong man, had he been a waverer or a man easily turned aside from his object at the time when he started the land legislation of the Government of which he was a member, there would have been very little progress made, and none of the great reforms we have now would have been brought about. It was his indomitable will and the courage of his convictions that impressed the House, and many a time he got votes through this from some who had doubts in the matter ; the earnestness and conviction he showed convinced them that, at any rate, he was determined to do what was right, and they gave him the benefit of the doubt, even when they had great doubts of the wisdom of the measures he brought up. So that a less strong man would have made very little progress. And as has been truly stated by the Premier and the leader of the Opposition, and by my friend Major Steward, he always and at every time had the welfare of the masses of the people at heart. Coming as he did, as has been stated previously, from the Highlands of Scotland, and seeing the devastation that was made 
<page:312>
soil, and made it really worth having, owing to the labour they had spent on it-land that was in many instances valueless-and seeing these people ruthlessly cleared away to make room for deer for the pastime and sport of a few wealthy men, impressions were made on the strong individual mind of John McKenzie that were never effaced from it. They never could be. The idea of preventing similar things in New Zealand was always before his mind, be- cause he has said to me time and again, " If ever I have the opportunity you will see that I will do all that I can so that the lands of New Zealand will be for the people." And he stuck to that from the day he entered Parliament until sickness overtook him and laid him aside. Then, he was a kind man; although rugged in politics, and to the Opposition generally he was of a very different disposition, yet he was more kind by far than many people would give him credit for. And when he had a friend he was one of those men who would stick to that friend until he was convinced that he was a fraud or an impostor. Nothing short of that would shake his friendship. He was a true friend and a true legislator for the people, and one that could be very ill spared. I cannot say any more, only that I deplore with others the loss the colony has sustained, and that I desire to support this motion that a vote of condo- lence be forwarded to his family. In that I heartily join. Mr. GILFEDDER (Wallace) .- Sir, as one of the younger members of the House, and as the representative of a district in which the deceased gentleman had many warm friends and many political admirers, I wish to add my tribute of respect to the memory of the states- man who has done so much to mould the destinies of this colony. By his strict integ- rity, honesty of purpose, and indomitable per- severance in promoting the welfare of this country, and in endeavouring to advance the best interests of his fellow - men, Sir John Mckenzie has earned the good-will, the esteem, and approbation of every right-thinking man and woman in New Zealand. His career has been an honourable one, and by his unswerv- ing adherence to political principle, as well as by the success that has attended his legislative enactments, his name has become a household word, and he has made for himself a reputation which I venture to say will never pass away. Well might he exclaim towards the close of his political career, " Exegi monumentum ære perennius "-" I have com- pleted a monument which will be more lasting than brass." "The path of glory leads 3.30. but to the grave," and, although Sir John Mckenzie has passed away, his good works remain as a monument of his sterling qualities and of his undoubted ability. They reflect the highest credit upon himself and upon the Administration of which he was a worthy member and at the same time a tower of strength. Though he has left us, his memory will not be forgotten, and so long as the spark- ling waters of the Shag River flow down that Mr. Duncan memory of Sir John Mckenzie be remembered and revered by the people of this colony. Mr. T. MACKENZIE (Waihemo) .- As suc- cessor to the late Sir John Mckenzie in the electorate of Waihemo I desire to say a few words on this occasion. On behalf of his late constituents I wish to express the great grief they have experienced through the loss of so able a man-a man who has been stricken down in the vigour of his manhood. He has been stricken down at a time when this House was justified in expecting important legislation and most valuable assistance from him. I can tes- tify to the grief and regret of that important con- stituency ; but it would be out of place for me to say more on this occasion, for his career has been ably dealt with by older and abler members than myself. Mr. MEREDITH (Ashley). - Sir, I cannot refrain from saying a few words on this solemn occasion, although I can scarcely trust myself, so strong are my emotions. When the Premier read the telegram last evening the biblical quo- tation flashed through my mind, " A great man has fallen this day in Israel." This quota- tion becomes the occasion in its application to the late Sir John Mckenzie. The deceased statesman was a son of the soil. Born in Scot- land, he came out to Otago in 1860, and is there- fore a colonist of forty-one years' standing. He possessed a splendid physique, a strong will, an inflexible constancy of purpose, honesty of intention, heroic courage, and a kindly heart. These are some of the qualities that enter into the composition of great men. He was neither an adventurer nor an opportunist. He was an honest man, which is "the noblest work of God." In all his actions he was actuated by the highest principles of statesmanship. He was a manly opponent, worthy of a foeman's steel; he neither cherished revenge nor brooded over defeat. He has died prematurely. Those who knew him best know that he prac- tically sacrificed himself upon the altar to his country. His memory will live in the hearts of the people of this colony ; and, after all, the noblest shrine that a man can have is the con- sciousness within himself that he has tried to do his duty to the best of his ability, and that he lives in the hearts of the people whom he has served. Sir, I cannot do better than close these few remarks by quoting some lines from one of Emerson's poems :- Life is too short to waste In critic peep or cynic bark, Quarrel or reprimand. 'Twill soon be dark ; Up! Mind thine own aim, and God speed the mark. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) .- I only have a few words to say. Sir John Mckenzie's persever- ance, and his high purpose, and his success are undoubtedly an example to all New Zealand poli- ticians and politicians elsewhere ; and no doubt he will be remembered in New Zealand very largely, and perhaps mostly, by his successful political career. But there is another side to his character-the side that, to my mind, touches an even sweeter chord-that part of his nature 
<page:313>
in his own home before I came into politics, and I have known him there since, and I think I can safely say that all the rugged side of his character disappeared within the walls of his own home. He was blessed with a sweet and noble wife, and, Sir, they lived a sweet and noble life together. I know that Lady Mckenzie will mourn his loss even more than the country will. But, Sir, that side of his character, coupled with the other more rugged side which we are more closely connected with, formed a cha- racter in the whole which I feel certain will go down in New Zealand history. Sir, I think those who have lived with him in politics, and those who have known him in his own home, will have received a benefit which, I feel sure, will be lasting. Mr. WITHEFORD (Auckland City) .- Sir, I am sure, on behalf of the people living in the extreme North, I can join with the people in the extreme South in expressing our deep and solemn sympathy at the death of a fellow-man and fellow - worker in political life. We all acknowledge the great force of character of the late statesman who was the Macandrew of the South Island ; and, just as Macandrew was the great power in southern railway-construction, so Sir John McKenzie was the great power in land matters. I am sure the people in the South Island will ever reverence his name, and whatever my constituency may think as regards his land policy, which is perhaps not exactly in accord with their sentiments, at the same time they join in the reverential expression of regret at the death of Sir John McKenzie. Motion agreed to. #cc-zero Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- A very large num- ber of members desire to pay their last re- spects to our late comrade, and the arrange- ments are that the Government steamer leaves at midnight and will proceed to Oamaru, and from there a train will take members to Palmerston, where, so far as I know at the present time, the interment is to take place. Others will probably go by the afternoon's steamer ; but, whichever way they go, there will be a special train leaving Palmerston for Lyttelton in time to catch the steamer " Hine- moa " for the North. Members will there- fore be enabled to reach Wellington again about midday on Saturday. This being so, I feel sure I shall be consulting the wishes of members and paying respect to the memory of our late comrade, and the visitation to our Empire by the death of Her Imperial High- ness the Dowager Empress of Germany, by moving, That the House do adjourn until Tues- day next, at half-past two o'clock in the after- noon. Motion agreed to. The House adjourned at twenty minutes to four o'clock p.m. Tuesday, 13th August, 1901. Death of the Dowager Empress of Germany-Govern- ment Arch-Land- and Survey Report -Cemetery Trustees Validation and Appointment B.Il -- Stare-school Children Drill Bill - The Wellington Harbour Board Act 1879 Amendment Bill- Election of Chairman of Committees. The Hon. the SPEAKER took the chair at half- past two o'clock. PRAYERS. DEATH OF THE DOWAGER EMPRESS OF GERMANY. The Hon. the SPEAKER read the following messages from His Excellency the Governor :- "To the Honourable the Speaker and Honour- able Members of the Legislative Council --- " I have received the resolutions passed by the Legislative Council, the one to the King's Most Excellent Majesty, the second requesting me to convey, through His Majesty's Principal Secre- tary of State for the Colonies, to the Emperor and Roval Family of Germany the expression of the deep sympathy of the Legislative Council on the occasion of the death of Her Imperial Majesty the Dowager Empress. " I have forwarded them both by telegraph for submission. "RANFURLY. " Government House, Wellington, 8th August, 1901." "Napier, 12th August, 1901. "To the Honourable the Speaker and Honour- able Members of the Legislative Council,- " The Governor has received through the Secretary of State for the Colonies the com- mand of His Majesty the King to convey his grateful thanks to the Legislative Council for their address and condolence on the death of Her Imperial Majesty the Empress Frederick. RANFURLY." On the motion of the Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER, it was ordered that these Messages be entered on the Journals of the Council. # GOVERNMENT ARCH. The Hon. Mr. ARKWRIGHT asked the Minister of Education, When the Government intend to have the arch near the Government Buildings removed ? Perhaps he might be allowed to explain why he put the question. It was rumoured that the Public Works ofti- cials were so pleased with their work that they were thinking of erecting something perma- nent. He hoped that the honourable gentle- man would be able to tell them that the arch would soon be pulled down. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER said the Wel- lington public required a good deal of education in regard to "architectural beauty," and no doubt that was the reason why the arch had been left so long standing. However, he could assure the honourable gentleman that the arch would soon be removed. 
<page:314>
The Hon. Mr. ORMOND asked the Minister of Education, When the annual report of the Department of Lands and Survey, and the report on the working of " The Land for Settle- ments Act, 1894," will be laid on the table of the Council ? The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER said he was informed that the report would be down as soon as possible. There had been a heavy amount of work in the Printing Office, and consequently this and other work had unfortunately been delayed longer than the Government liked. # CEMETERY TRUSTEES VALIDATION AND APPOINTMENT BILL. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- Sir, I move That the amendment proposed by His Excel. lency the Governor, namely : To omit clause 3 of this Bill, and insert in lieu therefore the fol- lowing, "It shall be lawful for the Governor to appoint the Rotorua Town Council as the Trustees of the Rotorua Cemetery," be agreed to. It will be seen that it is simply substitut- ing the same thing, but in different words, as was passed by the Council before. Motion agreed to. STATE-SCHOOL CHILDREN DRILL BILL. The Hon. Mr. KERR .- Sir, I beg to move the second reading of the Bill. When this Bill originated in another place it contained pro- vision for compulsory military drill ; but these provisions were struck out. In the original Act of 1877 it was provided that there should be military drill for boys in public schools ; and this Bill simply provides that physical drill for both sexes shall be compulsory, which is not so provided in the original Act. Clause 2 of the Bill says :- "It shall be the duty of the Board of Education in each district constituted under ' The Education Act, 1877,' to cause physical drill to be taught to all boys and girls over the age of eight years attending the public schools in the school district." Clause 4 provides,- " Every Education Board shall furnish a quarterly report to the Minister of Education showing that the requirements of this Act and the regulations made thereunder are being com- plied with." Clause 6 gives power to the teacher to exempt any boy or girl whom he considers unfit to undergo physical drill. There can be no doubt but that this will be of great benefit to some of the children attending our State schools. It will teach them deportment, obedience, exercise their physical powers, and do away with that slovenly gait that many of our school children have - dragging their legs along in a most slovenly way, with their faces towards the ground and their shoulders up. I think that if for nothing else but to develop their physical powers this Bill should be passed. There is nothing whatever drastic in it, and I trust the Council will pass the Bill. not wish to speak disrespectfully of this Bill, but it is a very insufficient Bill to carry out any object whatever. In the first place, it is very clumsily drafted, and, in the next place, it undertakes to effect that which is already given effect to in the principal Act. I do not know why it relates to physical drill only, because any one taking up the principal Act will see that not only is physical drill enjoined in our schools but military drill also. The Education Act of 1877 enjoins that, in our public schools "pro-  vision shall be made for the instruction in military drill of all boys, and, in such of the schools as the Board shall from time to time direct, provision shall also be made for physical training, and whenever practicable there shall be attached to each school a play-ground of at least a quarter of an acre." Well, I think any one who goes about the schools, as I dare say most of us do-of course, it is my duty when going about the different parts of the country to visit the schools to see how things are going on. But. Sir, quite apart from official duties, I am quite certain most of us, when we go to different parts of the colony, attend these different schools and see what is going on from the pleasure it gives. I am quite certain most of us attend these schools, to see how the rising generation is coming on, with a great deal of pleasure. I think the mover spoke about the slovenly gait of our children. Well, upon my word, I will not take that as a real allegation against our school-children as a whole. I think our boys and girls may be frank, and blunt, and not afraid of anybody. If you speak to them they will speak to you, and they will answer you from the bottom of their hearts in the manner in which you address them. But I will not admit for one minute that our children are slovenly, or slouching, or anything of the sort. They are the boys and girls who are going to make the right sort of men and women when they grow up. They are not afraid of any one so long as they have not a care on their minds, or anything they need be ashamed of. Perhaps this is going away from the question at issue, which is this Bill. It is a harmless Bill. My honourable friend on the left says, " What is the use of it ? " I cannot say; but I main- tain that we have got just as much provision as we want in the Education Act of 1877 to enforce the teaching of drill to the boys, and also physical training to every scholar in the schools of the colony. And, more than that, I maintain that if you go to the schools you will find that drill to the boys, and physical drill to the girls, is being afforded in nearly every school in the country. Of course the drafting of this Bill is very extraordinary. It is called, in the first place, "The State- school Children Drill Bill." What is a State school? It is a form of nomenclature which I never saw before, and which applies to nothing in this colony. I know what a public school is, but I do not know what a State school is. And so on throughout the Bill. It will have to be amended clause by clause, so as to bring it into conformity with the circumstances of the 
<page:315>
am not prepared to say whether it is to be of any use or not, but it simply is affirming a principle already on the statute-book. I do not want to vote against it, because I do not want to say that the necessity of drill should not be emphasized ; but I hardly like to do it, be- cause it seems to me that in passing this Bill we are simply emphasizing what already exists. I have just laid on the table to-day a paper giving the report of the organization of the cadets at the Royal review at Christchurch, and I am certain that any one there must have felt quite satisfied at the work that is going on in the colony at the present time with respect to the cadets. They were got together under great difficulties ; for although the cadets are trained in each school, and armed by the Education Department, still they have not the organiza- tion necessary to go into battalions and into brigades. Yet, with the necessary officers placed over them, these boys were brought on the parade-ground in a manner that did the heart of every one who saw them good. To my mind they were immensely superior in appearance and drill even to what we saw in Melbourne, where the expense of the cadet organization is very heavy indeed. They made real soldiers of them there ; whilst ours simply were school-boys who had mastered the drill, and walked past the flag like little heroes. Therefore I do not know As I said what the necessity for this Bill is. before, I do not like to object to a Bill which evi- dently has got a good intention behind it, but I do not think the intention is well expressed. The Hon. Mr. T. KELLY .- With respect to this Bill I am in a similar position to my honourable friend. I highly approve of phy- sical drill in schools ; but, as he says, that is already provided for by "The Education Act, 1877." I must say that the Education Boards throughout the colony in the larger schools have put it into operation, but, unless the colony intends to subsidise the Boards with more funds, it is absolutely impossible for them to carry this out in every school. It means the appointment of a drill-master, who must be paid to go round the schools, giving instruc- tions in drill. If the colony is going to supple- ment the funds of the Boards for this, well and good ; but if that is not to be done, then it simply means that this Bill will be a dead- letter. It is want of funds that prevents the Education Boards of the colony carrying this out in the way intended by the Education Act of 1877. To my mind, the better way to deal with this Bill - the object of which we all sympathize with, but it is duplicating legisla- tion -- is to refer it to the Statutes Revision Committee, and see whether anything can be done to supplement the existing laws. I do not like to vote against the Bill, the object of the mover being to make physical and military drill more general throughout the colony. This Bill, however, does not provide means to do that ; but leaves matters as they are at pre- sent. I think if the honourable member will allow the matter to go to the Statutes Revision Committee something might be done. inclined to vote against the Bill, because I am strongly in favour of any move which would tend to strengthen the physique of our children. It seems, however, from what the Minister of Education told us, that practically all that is provided for in this Bill is provided for in the principal Act, and, if that be so, then this Bill is not required. If what is provided for in this Bill is not provided for in the principal Act, then I think it is the duty of the (Government to bring down an amendment of that Act, and to see that the children throughout the whole of the colony are systematically drilled, as is in- tended in this measure. Whatever may be said as to military and physical drill being given to the youth of the colony, I do not think it goes far enough, judging from the gait and deport- ment of some of our children. When a man becomes old, naturally enough we expect him to stoop, but we do not like to see children stoop- ing, and if they stoop when they are young they will not get any better as they grow older ; and I think the bigger the chests of our men or women are, the better able are they to go through the world, to fight the battles of life, and do their duty as citizens. Now, it strikes me that, although in many of the schools great care is exercised to see that the children shall keep themselves straight, and observe decent deportment, yet there are some schools in which that is not done. I have seen child- ren stooping at their desks in school, and I have pitied them, because I have felt that they are being injured for life. Children often crouch down over their books, bringing their eyes close to their lessons, and the result is that they are contracting their chests and hurting their eye- sight. I say more care should be observed in these matters, and that Inspectors should be instructed to see that that is not done. The objection raised by the Hon. Mr. Kelly that, if this drill is made compulsory, additional drill- instructors would have to be provided, seems to me not to be warranted. The teacher, whether male or female, could surely give such instruc- tion wherever necessary. If the Bill which is now brought forward by the Hon. Mr. Kerr should have no other effect than to call atten- tion to the fact-for I say it is a fact that child- ren are often kept crouching over their lessons too long and too severely-then it will have effected a good purpose. Hon. Captain BAILLIE .- Sir, as one of those who have had some experience in edu- cational matters for the past twenty years, and having taken notice of what has been done in many of the schools, I can see that there are great difficulties in the way of carry- ing out a measure of this nature. Many of the teachers would have to be taught physical drill themselves, before they could instruct their pupils. You would require to send drill- sergeants all over the colony ; and, as there are so many small schools of not more than twenty or twenty-five pupils in out-of-the-way places, it would take a good many men all their time to go round visiting these schools. and instructing the teachers. I would also. 
<page:316>
there are already cadet corps. I have had some acquaintance with most of them when they have been under my command in various camps, and I can say that generally the boys of these cadet corps are the best drilled in the camp. I have seen them at Wanganui, Nelson, Christchurch, Wellington, Taranaki, and other places. The boys are well set up, and capable of doing any amount of physical work. The last camp I attended at Nelson I saw physical drill performed by the cadets, and also by the men, that was quite a treat to witness, and the instructors deserve every credit for their work. It is almost impossible not to sympathize with my honourable friend who has introduced this Bill, but the honourable member does not seem to see the difficulty. The Education Boards have not the funds to provide the necessary instruction, and, therefore, I think the Bill, if placed on the statute-book, will be only so much waste-paper. The Hon. Colonel PITT .- Sir, if I thought the Bill before us was only so much waste-paper I should vote against it, because, as honourable members know, I am one of those who hold a strong opinion against an unnecessary number of statutes being passed by Parliament. But, with all respect, I think the Hon. the Minister of Education did not quite state the whole case when he referred to this Bill being unnecessary, because he said the same provision was made in section 85 of the Education Act of 1877. If the honourable member refers to that section he will see that it only mentions military training for boys. This Bill provides for physical train- ing for boys and girls. Now, I think the phy- sical training of young girls is quite as import- ant as the physical training of boys.   The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- That is covered by section 85. The Hon. Colonel PITT .- I am not so sure of that. I think if section 85 is correctly in- terpreted, it will be found that girls are not included in it, and that it is confined to the boys. At all events, this Bill makes it per- fectly clear that the girls are to be instructed in physical drill as well as the boys ; and I am one of those who think that it is a very good thing indeed. These girls are to be the mothers of the future, and it is important that their physique should be developed quite as well as that of the boys. Now, as to the expense, which my honourable and gallant friend Colonel Baillie says would be incurred by the employment of hosts of drill-sergeants: That is quite unnecessary. My honourable friend knows that the present Volunteer regulations provide for that. The Commanding Officer of the district is required to allow the services of his staff sergeants to be available for the in- struction of boys attending the public schools, when it does not interfere with the other military duties of these sergeants. These in structors could teach at least one of the teachers at each school, and then the teacher in turn would be able to impart physical drill to the scholars. But, Sir, the physi- cal drill is so very simple that any teacher Hon. Captain Baillie without instruction from a drill - sergeant at all, and therefore I think that this Bill should, at all events, be read a second time, so that we may affirm the principle that physical drill is necessary. Let us emphasize it. I see that this Bill also provides for physical drill being imparted to children over eight years of age attending the Maori schools. Well, I do not think that provision is contained in the principal Act, though it is a provision of which we all can approve. But there is one provision in this Bill-the last one - of which I most decidedly approve. It says this Act shall not come into operation until the first day of January, 1902. A similar provision to that used to be contained in most of our statutes- that is to say, they did not come into operation until some months after they had passed. We have now got into the habit of making statutes come into operation on the day they pass, and the consequence is that very few people know anything about them. I think the Go- vernment might take a hint from this provi- sion, and, in the case of most of our important statutes, unless there is something which makes it inadvisable, postpone the date of their coming into operation for a few months. I shall sup- port the second reading of the Bill. The Hon. Mr. SCOTLAND. - Sir, I have listened to the honourable gentleman who has just spoken, advocating the passing of this Bill, and from his speech and the speeches of other honourable members in its favour one would imagine that there is no provision already ex- isting for developing the bodies of boys and girls attending the public schools of the colony. I hold, Sir, that the proper physical drill is to be found in the play-ground ; and I believe that the boys and girls of this colony will compare favourably with the boys and girls at the Go- vernment schools in any other part of the world. I have myself two boys at school, and I think I am not egotistical in saying you will not find boys better set-up in the colony. They are a great deal straighter in the back than I am, or ever was, for the simple reason that I had not their opportunities, when I was at a public school, of going into a play-ground and of strengthening my body at out-door games. I think the play-ground affords the very best of physical drill ; but if we introduce the system of quasi-military drill that this Bill provides for in our schools, in addition to the ordinary time passed in the play-ground, I think too much time will be taken from the schoolroom and from the studies of the boys and girls. I can- not help thinking, if I may be allowed to say so of a Bill which comes to us from another place, that this Bill ought not to have been introduced by a private member. It should have been left to the Government to determine whether such a measure was actually necessary for the physi- cal development of the boys and girls of the colony. I think it is not. The Hon. Mr. KERR .- I would like to say a few words in reply before the question is put. I scarcely think the Minister of Education has rightly read section 85 of the principal Act. If 
<page:317>
provision whatever made for the physical train- ing of girls. This Bill, therefore, makes special provision for the physical training of girls, and the Education Boards have to report to the Minister of Education that the requirements of the Act are being complied with. As re- gards expense, I quite agree with the Hon. Colonel Pitt when he says that physical drill can be taught without any heavy expense. am indebted to that honourable gentleman for the manner in which he has interpreted clause 85, and also for his support of the Bill. The Minister of Education probably thinks that this Bill should have emanated from himself. I can only say that it passed the other House, and that I was asked by the honourable member who introduced it there to take charge of it in this Council ; and surely the other House must have seen some virtues in it, otherwise they would not have passed it. When a Bill has been passed in another place, I do not think that it is reasonable to come to the conclusion all at once that it should be thrown aside here. I do not approve of work being performed in that way. I think every Bill sent to this Council ought to have the fullest consideration. As I said before, I quite agree with the Hon. Colonel Pitt, that if this Bill is passed great good will result to the girls of our public schools in the matter of deport- What is not provided for ment and discipline. in the original Act is provided for in this Bill. Clause 6 states, " Upon the principal teacher of any school being satisfied that any boy or girl is unfit to undergo physical drill, such boy or girl shall be exempted from being instructed in such drill." I hope honourable gentlemen will vote for the second reading of the Bill. Bill read the second time. THE WELLINGTON HARBOUR BOARD ACT 1879 AMENDMENT BILL. The Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON .- This Bill origi- nated in another place, and is promoted by the Wellington Harbour Board for the purpose of restoring representation to those districts which at one time formed part of the County of Wai- rarapa North and the Hutt County. It also proposes, by the addition of one member, to give representation to the counties in the Manawatu district, which they did not enjoy under the principal Act ; and, further, by clause 7, it is proposed to alter the date of the annual ac- counts from December to September, Decem- ber being found to be a very inconvenient time, both on account of holidays and the press of work at that period. I beg to move the second reading of the Bill. The Hon. Mr. JENKINSON .- I do not want it to be thought that I am showing captious opposition to this Bill when I point out that there is a clause in it amending " The Harbours Act, 1878," while the measure itself is called "The Wellington Harbour Board Act 1879 Amendment Bill." This may not be thought to be very important, but it is one of those things that give rise to the suspicion that Bills emanating from the Wellington Harbour Board watched in both Houses of the Legislature. This happened in reference to a Bill that was passed two years ago called "The Wellington City Reclamation and Public Baths Bill." It was a very harmless little measure when it passed through the Council. It gave power to the Harbour Board to grant permission to the Wellington City Corporation to build a reclama- tion wall some distance along Clyde Quay, and I also to build baths, the cost of which the Har- bour Board, I think, was to share to the extent of one noiety. Some time before a vote of the ratepayers was taken regarding the borrowing of money for this work, and the proposals as put before the ratepayers were, along with other works, the widening of Clyde Quay to a distance of 100 ft., building a retaining wall for some quarter of a mile along the front of it, and to build baths. Now, these proposals went to the ratepayers, and the result was that the ratepayers gave permission for the money to be borrowed, and the work was gone on with. Several hundred feet of the wall had been built, and some reclamation done, when, a few weeks ago, a paragraph appeared in the Evening Post to the effect that after the wall was finished it was intended by the Harbour Board to enclose about five acres of water, by building another wall, or rather two walls, overlapping at the ends, some 250 ft. outside the wall now being built, to serve as a breakwater, and to put up boat-sheds against the inner wall, and also on the skids on the inner side of the outer break- water. When the plans came before the Local Bills Committee in 1898 dealing with the recla- mation and public baths, there was absolutely nothing to show that a boat-harbour was going to be formed, or that boat-sheds were going to be built outside this wall. I venture to say, if such a project had been shown, the Bill would not have passed through this Chamber without alteration, and this objectionable proposal elimi- nated. And I am quite sure that, when the proposal was put before the ratepayers, there was not one ratepayer in a hundred who bad any idea that the Harbour Board or the Cor- poration had any intention that these boat- sheds were to be placed outside the walls. The ratepayers understood, and the general citizens of Wellington also understood, that it was to be a promenade -- an esplanade, such as exists at Thorndon-and that it would form one of the very few walks in Wellington. They are now startled with the proposal that im- mediately outside the wall these boat-sheds are going to be built. If the ratepavers had known of this ridiculous proposal they would, I am sure, have never given their sanction for the work to be done. When the Corporation was approached on the matter, a few days ago, they got out of the question very quietly by saying that the Harbour Board was well within its rights in building the boat-sheds, and that the roofs of the sheds were not to extend more than 4 ft. above the top of the wall. Well, the top of the wall is about 3 ft. 6 in. above the level of the road, so that another 4 ft. makes it 7 ft. 6 in., which will absolutely prevent any view of the 
<page:318>
very object for which it was intended is lost. And, not only that, but a great number of boat- owners have already built sheds in different parts of the harbour, and they themselves are totally against the boat-sheds being placed on this wall, being of the opinion that it is unsuitable. It is not as though they were cramped for space in Wellington Harbour; there are numerous other places and better positions for boat-sheds. This particular complaint may not be quite analogous to the Bill now before the Council, but it points to the fact that Bills as introduced by, at least, Wellington public bodies, and passed by the House, sometimes have ulterior objects which the members of the House do not see, not being acquainted with the circumstances of the case ; and the plans showing the ultimate alterations that are to be made are not put before the House. There is one great saving clause in the matter of these boat-sheds, inas- much as this Harbour Board, or any Harbour Board, is not empowered to build without permission from the Minister of Marine .. understand that permission has not yet been given by the Minister of Marine in this case, and, I trust, will not be given. I also under- stand that numerous petitions are being got up asking the Minister to withhold his consent to allow the Wellington Harbour Board to put up these sheds. Sir, I called attention to the fact that this Bill amends two Acts. It deals with and purports by its title to amend " The Wellington Harbour Board Act, 1879," but it also deals with "The Harbours Act, 1878." The latter is not a very important amendment, I admit, but it is these little things connected with these local Bills which, as I said before, arouse suspicion and cause reports to go about   that Bills dealing with Wellington in any way whatever have to be watched very closely by the Houses of the Legislature. The Hon. Mr. T. KELLY .- Sir, I move the adjournment of the debate on this Bill. I have just seen the Bill for the first time, having been absent from Wellington, and it seems to me it requires a little inquiry on my part to satisfy myself that the Bill is a fair one and does no injury in any way. It deals with the con- stitution of the Board, I understand, very materially, and I should like to know if the local bodies who are interested have had their opinions asked in regard to the alteration. I know that the public bodies as a rule have no conscience; if they want a thing they strive to get it, without regard to the public interest generally ; and therefore it is the duty of the Council to protect the public interest. The remarks made by my honourable friend who has just sat down throw some suspicion over the dealings of the Wellington Harbour Board in other matters. Of course, the interests of the public at large are supposed to be guarded by the Government under the general Har- bours Act of 1878. No Harbour Board can infringe the public rights on the foreshore with- out the consent of the Governor in Council. That power ought to be ample, but sometimes we find that local importunity and local repre- Hon. Mr. Jenkinson things that he ought not to do. The Governor in Council is sometimes so weak as to submit to local pressure, and then the public interests are sacrificed. I think the best thing to do with the Bill is to adjourn the debate until members have had time to look over it and satisfy their minds that the Bill is a right one and in the public interests. The Hon. Mr. W. C. SMITH .- I do not think it is necessary to adjourn this debate. The Council must remember that this Bill has been before the Local Bills Committee, and that there it must have been carefully looked into. It has also been before another Chamber, and no doubt fairly dealt with there. I have looked into the Bill and can see nothing unfair in it. It is an ordinary Bill, dealing with the matter of the constitution of the Board, and a Bill which has been brought in by a number of otber Harbour Boards. I think the second reading can be taken now, and there will be sufficient time to make further inquiries before the Bill goes into Committee. The Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON. - I hope the Hon. Mr. T. Kelly will not press his motion. There is really no need to adjourn the debate. The Bill simply proposes to increase the repre- sentation of the country districts on the Board, a step which I think the honourable gentleman entirely approves of. The Hon. Mr. T. KELLY .- When do you propose to commit the Bill ? The Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON .- There is no hurry, and I will move for its committal to-morrow week. The Hon.' Mr. T. KELLY .- Then, Sir, I would like to withdraw my motion. Motion for adjournment, by leave, with- drawn. Bill read the second time. # ELECTION OF CHAIRMAN OF COM- MITTEES. ADJOURNED DEBATE. The Hon. Mr. W. C. SMITH .- I would just like to say that I do not think there is any neces- sity for this resolution. A certain procedure has taken place in this Chamber and in another place ever since the Constitution was drawn up, and I do not see what advantage would be gained by making an alteration. If we do make an alteration, and if we go to the ballot, let us put it on a fair and reasonable basis. The present position, if we go to a ballot. is the worst possible. We have to vote for three per- sons, and that means that members of the Council have to vote for two persons who they do not wish to vote for. I know of no place where, when a ballot is taken, persons are made to vote for persons they do not want to vote for. The result is that in nearly every case the lowest one voted for on the first ballot will, in the end, have a majority, and will be elected to the position. One member of the Council gets, say, fourteen votes, another mem- ber twelve votes, and another member four or five votes in the first ballot. There would then bo three names that would be voted for. 
<page:319>
ballot the supporters of the members who got fourteen votes and twelve votes would not vote for one another. They would be watching one another, and naturally say, " We will not assist an opponent," and then cast their second vote for the man who got five votes. In the second ballot, most likely, the man who originally got fourteen votes would go out, and then, in the final ballot, the supporters of the man who got fourteen votes would go for the man who only got five votes, and he would be returned. A worse system of electing by ballot than that used here it would be hard to conceive. If we are to have election by ballot, let us have it pure and simple. Let nominations be made on a certain day to be fixed, and on those names nominated let a straight vote of the Council be taken, and the majority return whoever they wish. Under the present system there are quite a number of informal ballot-papers. I hope, at all events, if we do make a change, it will be in a fair and reasonable direction, so that we shall have a proper ballot, and not a ballot by which we shall have to vote for persons we do not want to vote for. No such form of ballot, under the same circumstances, is used in any other part of this colony. Forty odd names are put before members, and we do not know whether any of those gentlemen wish to stand, and they have to cast a vote for two members they do not wish to vote for. I hope, if the Council alter the system, they will put it in a proper way. I shall vote against the resolution because I can see no need for the change. At  present, any member has a right to move to strike out the name of the person nominated, and insert another name. That is proper and straight-out voting. Surely the Council, who have no constituents, are not afraid to show how they vote on a simple question of this kind. If we are afraid to vote openly in this Chamber, and the other Chamber is not afraid, .then it shows the Council is going backward and not forward. I shall oppose the resolution for the reasons I have given. The Hon. Mr. REEVES .- My reply will be very short. The honourable gentleman who has just sat down has given us a bit of a lecture on how we ought to vote for Chairman of Committees. I have no doubt that, to a certain extent, the honourable gentleman is right ; but this motion simply says : "And it be an instruction to the Standing Orders Com- mittee to prepare the necessary new order." I presume it will be in the power of the Standing Orders Committee to bring in such a form of voting as they may think necessary. That is all I have to say on the matter, excepting this : that we have seen, on more than one occasion in this Council, when a gentleman has been put forward who has not been particularly with the Council, that the result has been that we have had to go to the ballot. If we have it laid down in the Standing Orders that a ballot must be taken, it will do away with that diffi- culty. That is all I have to say in the matter. The Hon. Mr. W. C. SMITH .- As a matter of personal explanation, I wish to say that I a reflection on me. I say that he himself wished to be a candidate, and therefore I was personally unpopular to him. The Hon. Mr. REEVES .- I must take ex ception to the remarks made by the honourable- gentleman. I never was a candidate for the position of Chairman of Committees, and I never even mentioned a word about it. But I reiterate what I said before : that it will do away with what we have had on former occa- sions if we carry this motion. The Council divided. AYES, 15.

Mr. SPEAKER read the following message from His Excellency the Governor :- " To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives,- " I have received the resolutions passed by the House of Representatives, the one to the King's Most Excellent Majesty, the second requesting me to convey through His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, to the Emperor and Royal Family of Germany, the expression of the deep sympathy of the House of Representatives on the occasion of the death of Her Imperial Majesty the Dowager Empress. " I have forwarded them both by telegraph for submission. " RANFURLY. " Government House, Wellington, 8th August, 1901." On the motion of Mr. SEDDON (Premier), it was ordered, That the message be entered on the Journals of the House. Mr. SPEAKER read the following further message from His Excellency the Governor :- "Napier, 12th August, 1901. "To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives,- "The Governor has received through the Secretary of State for the Colonies the com- mand of His Majesty the King to convey his grateful thanks to the House of Representa- tives for their address and condolence on the death of Her Imperial Majesty the Empress Frederick. "RANFURLY." On motion of Mr. SEDDON (Premier), it was ordered, That the message be entered on the Journals of the House. FIJI. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- I desire to lay on the table a copy of a letter from the Rev. W. Slade, with further reference to the situation in Fiji, and I move, That it be laid on the table and printed. Motion agreed to. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) .- 3.0. Sir, in connection with this letter from the Rev. Mr. Slade, which contains a further reference to the position in Fiji, may I ask the Premier whether the letter of Mr. Chamberlain, in which he refers to Sir George O'Brien's action in Fiji, and to the newspaper comments upon those acts, has been laid on the table ? 
<page:321>
sent by the Hon. Mr. Chamberlain to Sir George O'Brien has been ordered to be laid on the table. The newspaper comments have not been laid on the table, nor is it usual to lay newspaper comments on the table. Mr. MASSEY .- We have nothing to do with newspaper comments. Mr. FISHER .- Sir, I did not ask that the newspaper comments should be laid on the table. I merely said that Mr. Chamberlain, in the letter to which I referred, had expressed a very decided opinion in regard to the news- paper comments upon Sir George O'Brien's action in Fiji. # LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL COM- MITTEE. Mr. McNAB (Mataura) brought up an interim report from the Local Government Bill Com- mittee, recommending that the House should meet on Tuesdays and Fridays at such an hour as would enable the Local (Government Com- mittee to sit during the forenoon of those days, and complete its labours. He moved. That the report do lie on the table, and be referred to the Government for consideration. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) might say that he would think over the matter, and would per- sonally take the opinion of honourable members on the question. If he allowed the motion now before the House to pass, it might be taken that he acquiesced in it. The motion was passed by the Counties Bill Committee in his absence that morning. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston) would like to point out that, according to the rate of pro- gress the Committee was making with the Bill, it would be entirely unnecessary to take away the morning sittings to facilitate the passing of the measure. He thought that one meeting a week for the next three weeks would finish the Bill, and, under the circumstances, it seemed unfair that they should trench on the morning sittings, which so far had been a great success. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) would like to say, in reply to the last speaker, that so far the Com- mittee had not dealt with any debatable matter in the Bill. The Committee were unanimously of opinion that leave should be granted to sit on Tuesdays and Fridays. Owing to the number of Committees sitting on Wednesdays and Thursdays those mornings were fully occupied, and it was almost impossible for the Counties Committee to do any work on those days. The work of this Committee was at present just as important as the business of the House, and he hoped that some arrangement such as had been aggested would be made. Mr. W. FRASER (Wakatipu) said that so many Committees sat on Wednesdays and Thursdays it was almost impossible for the Local Government Committee to meet. The general feeling of members was that they should not do Committee work on Saturdays and Mondays. Therefore, if the Committee was to make due progress with the Bill, it would be ! in reply, said that instructions had been given VOL. CXVII .- 20. Fridays. Mr. McNAB (Mataura) said the Committee thought they should have an opportunity of meeting on Tuesdays and Fridays, because on Wednesdays and Thursdays so many Commit- tees sat that the members of this very large Committee could not be got together. Motion agreed to. UNAUTHORISED EXPENDITURE. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) asked as a matter of urgency, When the Colonial Treasurer intended to lay on the table the return of unauthorised expenditure for the year ending 31st March last. According to the Public Revenues Act this re- turn should have been laid before Parliament within ten days from the commencement of the session. Last year it was laid on the table on the 29th June. This was the 13th August, and the House had not seen the return yet. Mr. SEDDON (Colonial Treasurer) thought the matter referred to might with advantage stand over for a notice of motion. HEALTH OFFICER FOR WAIMATE. Major STEWARD (Waitaki) asked the Minister of Public Health,-(1.) When the Health Officer will be appointed for the Town and District of Waimate? (2.) When the de- partment will be able to comply with the re- quest of the Waimate County Council, con- veyed in a letter dated the 1st July, that a thorough examination be made of the surround- ings, water-supply, et cetera, at a locality known as Princes Street, outside of the boundary of Waimate Borough, cases of typhoid having recently occurred there ? The Waimato County Council, in a communication to him, had raised this question of the appointment of a Health Officer. On the 19th June they wrote to the department asking who had been appointed Health Officer for the district ; and they received a reply on the 26th June, to the effect that, owing to unavoidable cir- cumstances, all the local Health Officers had not been appointed, but that an ap- pointment would be made at an early date. On the 1st July the Council wrote again, notifying that they had been apprised of the occurrence of two cases of typhoid in a certain locality, and urging the necessity of a proper medical inspection of that portion of the dis- trict by the Health Department. A reply was received on the 14th July to the effect that the department hoped to have the inspection made at an early date. Something like two months had elapsed since the request was made, and the object of the question was to point out the ineffectiveness of a system which failed to pro- vide for an examination in a case where the presence of infectious disease had been reported, although a period of something like two months had elapsed, and he thought the Minister would therefore see that there was justification for the question which he now put. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister of Public Health). 
<page:322>
Canterbury, to proceed as soon as possible to Waimate, and report on the matters referred to. The other question, of the appointment of a Health Officer, he was looking into, but he could not give a definite answer respecting it at present. # COPYRIGHT ACT. Major STEWARD (Waitaki) asked the Colo- nial Secretary, -- (1.) If the Government will consider the advisableness of amending the Copyright Act with a view to providing further protection to authors, dramatists, and musical composers against the piracy of their plays or works ? (2.) Whether, in any proposed amend- ment of the existing law, a provision will be included making such piracy an offence punish- able by imprisonment, with or without option of fine ? The reason for this question was this : There were persons who paid large sums of money for the copyright of plays, et cetera ; and there was a case the other day in which it was reported that $4,500 had been paid for such a copyright, and the proprietor's interests in the matter having been infringed, the only remedy he had was by way of injunction, which was sometimes a cumbersome and expensive process. It occasionally happened that there were persons, who were practically men of straw, who were willing to run the risk of a fine because there was no option of imprison- ment, and further, because they had the chance of making money by their piracy to an amount sufficient to make it worth their while to run the risk of a fine, as they could pay it out of the proceeds. It was, therefore, desirable that a discretion should be given to the Court, which would enable it to hold offenders in terrorem - namely, of imposing imprisonment as the alter- native of a fine, or, in its discretion, without option of fine. Sir J. G. WARD (Colonial Secretary) said there were now before the Imperial Parlament Bills amending the Copyright Act, with regard to, he believed, literature and dramatic works. These Bills had been under the consideration of a Commission of Law Lords, and, as soon as any legislation was passed in the Old Country on the subject, the working of the Copyright Act in New Zealand would be considered. CARRIAGE OF ARTIFICIAL MANURES. Mr. LANG (Waikato) asked the Minister for Railways, If he will take the necessary steps to have bone-dust and other artificial manures carried free on the Government railways? Last year he asked a similar question, and he then pointed out that the free carriage of lime had been the means of doing a large amount of good in some parts of the country : but there were some districts where lime was of little or no value for agricultural purposes, and where it was of far more importance to the farmers that bone-dust and artificial manures should be carried free. By doing so, the railways would benefit ultimately by the increased amount of produce that would be produced, and that would have to be carried over the Bir J. G. Ward that the manures in question could be carried free, he still hoped that the Minister would be able to reduce the freight on artificial manures, and that at an early period he would be able to carry bone-dust entirely free. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) was sorry he could not give the honourable member an affirmative reply, for the simple reason that he did not think the railways ought to be used for the carriage of anything free -- not even for the free carriage of lime. He did not think that anything should be carried over the railways free that required necessarily an initial cost to be provided for by the department to enable that article to be so carried. If the principle were applied to one article it ought to be applied to many more ; but he quite agreed with the honourable member in his desire that manures should be carried at as low a rate as possible, and he personally strongly favoured this. He might say the question of the reduction of the freight on manures was now under considera- tion. # ENCOURAGEMENT TO LOCAL INDUSTRIES. Mr. WITHEFORD (Auckland City) asked the Government, If they will consider the ques- tion of giving special encouragement to the wine industry of New Zealand, the manufac- ture of white-lead, and other colonial industries not now being supported by the Government, but requiring support ? He would like to see the Goverment paying some attention to the internal wants of the people, such as providing employment for the returned members of the contingents, and in a practical manner aiding the development of many of the industries which, in the future, were going to make the Colony of New Zealand. There was one in. dustry - the wine industry - in the North Island which was capable of great extension. The district of Auckland was capable of pro- ducing wine in great abundance, and it would be far better for the people to drink good wine than bad whiskey. Another industry that ought to be encouraged was the manu- facture of white-lead. There was a firm in Auckland who, if a bonus were granted, were quite prepared to undertake the manufacture of that article. All these industries would absorb labour, and if the Government would take into consideration the question of offering facilities for and encouragement to the establishment of industries of this nature. there would be no difficulty in finding employment for the re- turned contingent troopers, who, under present. circumstances, it was said, could not get work because the official avenues were all filled up. and there would be no difficulty in a country Co rich in natural resources as New Zealand in finding employment for the whole of the British Army in South Africa if they came to New Zealand. He hoped the Government 3.29. would drop all experimental legislation for a time, and set to work and consider the resources of the colony and the requirements of its people, many of whom were wanting 
<page:323>
the colony would progress to a greater extent than any other British colony. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) said one could not but admire the optimism of his honourable friend-a characteristic which it would be a good thing for a great many people in the colony if they possessed. In suggesting that bonuses should be given for the building-up of industries in the colony, his honourable friend, however, was asking for the initiation of a policy which he thought was undesirable, if not impracticable. If industries required to be built up in that way, it was only a matter . of time when they would end disastrously through the withdrawal of the bonus. The proper way to build up industries was by a broader and more natural system, and he thought the fairest way of all was through the Customs duties, and under them they could be built up. If the honourable gentleman asked in what direction the Government could encourage the wine industry, and the manu- facture of white-lead, he must reply that while he would be pleased to see them legitimately furthered in every way, they must be allowed to grow up in the natural order of things under the existing Customs tariff protection. # PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS. Mr. COLLINS (Christchurch City) asked the Government, Whether they will consider the advisability of granting societies for the pre- vention of cruelty to animals subsidies of, say, £1 for #1, thus assisting them in their laudable and necessary work? Speaking from his own knowledge, he could say that a great amount of extremely useful work was done by these societies in the community, and they prevented a great amount of cruelty. He was further quite sure that they saved the police a very con- siderable amount of work. Taking all these things into consideration, he thought the move- ment deserved, more than others, consideration at the hands of the Government. He was not wedded to the amount of the subsidy, but so far all the funds available had been raised by volun- tary contributions, and he thought the time had now come when the Government ought to assist in some degree. If the Government could not give £1 for $1. perhaps the honour- able gentlemen would say how much they would be prepared to give. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) said one could not but admire the laudable work carried out by these societies ; but at the same time he had always regarded it - and, no doubt, others did -as a labour of love, and the outcome of a desire on the part of well-disposed people to prevent cruelty to defenceless animals. He did not think it was advisable, however, that these societies, which had for so many years carried on this good work. should be supported by sub- sidies from the Government. There was, he was assured, no very heavy expenditure en- tailed, and, so far as he knew, no representa- tions had reached the Government showing that these societies were so financially weak as work. He hoped the societies would continue their good work in the future without asking assistance from the Government. Mr. COLLINS said he knew in many cases the power for good of these societies was greatly curtailed owing to want of funds, and their work was not supported by the public as it should be ; they as a rule did the work and contributed the money too, and, that being so, he thought they were deserving of some help from the Government. Sir J. G. WARD pointed out that it was the duty of the police throughout the colony to prevent cruelty to animals: and if private societies were to receive Government aid for doing the same thing, it would be better for the Government to set up a department to do the whole business. # RAILWAY CHARGES. Mr. HOUSTON (Bay of Islands) asked the Minister for Railways, If he will reduce the charges on the Opua-Kawakawa and on the Dargaville-Kaihu lines to bring them into con- formity with other lines in the colony ? A great injustice was being done to the settlers on these small lines, one of which was seven miles long and the other about sixteen. A first-class fare on the Opua-Kawakawa line was 3s. for a dis- tance of seven miles, and the second-class fare was 2s. ; the freight per ton measurement was 10s .; and there was not another line in the colony that could show such exorbitant charges. Then, on the Dargaville-Kaihu line the freight was 11s. 4d., while on other lines it was 3s. 4d. The freight on gum on this line was 11s. 4d. and on other lines 9s. 6d. He felt satisfied if the Minister considered the matter he would see the injustice of this, and endeavour to have it rectified. He would point out also that while concessions had been granted on the other lines of the colony no concession had been made in these instances. He hoped to get a favour- able answer, and that the reproach of neglect- ing the far North would be removed. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) said this was not a case of neglecting the far North. The difficulty was that these lines did not pay. The working of the Opua-Kawakawa line last year resulted in a loss of €185. The matter was a difficult one. No member of the Govern- ment was desirous of seeing differential rates in operation in any part of the colony. Mr. HOUSTON .- The railway system is a complete system in itself, and one individual railway should not be separated from it. Sir J. G. WARD said, At the same time it would never do, where the traffic on a line was inadequate to give a reasonable return. to charge the same rates as in the case of lines which were assisting to pay their cost. In regard to the Dargaville Kaihu line the ques- tion of rates there were now under the considera- tion of the Government, with a view to seeing whether relief could be given. Mr. HOUSTON said the reason why the traffic was not paying was because owing to 
<page:324>
of Kerikeri. Sir J. G. WARD said he was afraid that was not the actual cause, but he was prepared to look into the honourable gentleman's represen- tations. SOUTHBRIDGE BRANCH TRAINS. Mr. RHODES (Ellesmere) asked the Minis- ter of Railways, If he will make provision for the construction of a turn-table at the terminus of the Southbridge line, so as to enable more powerful engines to be employed, and thereby increase the speed of the trains running on that branch ? It was a matter of very great com- plaint amongst those who travelled by this line that the trains between Christchurch and Southbridge were remarkable not only for their slowness, but also for their unpunctuality. The trains were frequently late, and almost always on market days; so much so, that per- sons living in the neighborhood of Greenpark, Lincoln, and Springston preferred to drive rather than go by train, and were then able to get into town before the train, even when start- ing at the same time. There was a 'bus leaving Lincoln a few minutes before the train which was able to land its passengers in Christchurch at the same time as the passengers by train. The Minister ought to be able to run the trains so as to compete successfully with the road. Therefore, he asked the Minister for Railways if he could give them a more powerful engine on this line, so as to increase the rate of speed, or give them a passenger and a goods train throughout the year. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) might say, in reply, that if the difficulty could be got over in the way suggested by the honour-   able member, he would be very glad to give effect to the suggestion ; but it would not get over the difficulty. The reason of this was, that there were fourteen intermediate stopping- places in a journey of thirty-one miles. Nine of these were separated by a distance of only a mile and a half each. Now, when trains were stopped at such short distances, in any part of the world, it necessarily took time ; and the inevitable result was that, if they wished to give railway facilities to people a mile and a half distant from each other, they must take a longer time over the journey. The construction of a turn-table at the Southbridge end of the line, and the placing of a more powerful engine on the line, would not affect the matter whatever. The only thing that would be of any use was the complete separation of the passenger and goods traffic, and the running of passenger trains -through trains which would require to pass a number of the stations, the next train passing those the first one stopped at, and calling at the other stations-in other words, stopping at the stations alternately. The solution of the question was difficult. There were an unusual number of stopping- places close together, and the trouble was that the body of the traffic did not warrant a com- plete separation of the goods and passenger traffic. That being so, he was afraid they must Mr. Houston the duty of the department to do its best to carry on the mixed traffic, and he could assure the honourable gentleman that would be done. INFANT MORTALITY : POPULATION. Major STEWARD (Waimate) asked the Minister of Public Health, - (1.) Whether, in view of the fact that a considerable pro- portion of the infant mortality arises from ignorance on the part of parents, he will cause the Chief Health Officer to prepare a leaflet or pamphlet for free public circulation, contain- ing simple rules for the proper care and feeding of infants and young children ? (2.) Whether he will give consideration to the expediency and practicability of providing cheap maternity attendance for the poor ? (3.) Whether he will further consider the expediency of introducing legislation with a view to restricting the sale of certain medicaments known as " preventives" ? As the wealth of a country consisted more in its population than in its products, it was not surprising to find a reference which bore on this question in the Speech from the Throne, with which His Excellency had opened the present session. The falling-off in the birth- rate was a matter of national concern : but as the third part of his question, dealing with this matter, had already been provided for by the introduction, since he had given notice of the question, of a Bill by the Govern- ment, he need not enlarge upon that point. With regard to the other two branches of the question, he might point out that if it was desirable a country should increase by accre- tions from within by natural increase, as well as by accretions from without. it was equally important that those born in the country should live and grow up to manhood and womanhood. There were some very startling figures to which he wished to draw the honour- able gentleman's attention - figures connected with the death-rate. He found from the last report that the deaths of children under five years of age represented about one-fourth of the total deaths in the whole population. That was to say, out of 7,000 deaths, 2,000-using round figures-were those of children under five years of age. The exact figures were 1,898 deaths of children under five, as against 7,198 deaths of all ages. Then, if the honourable gentleman would turn to the figures given in the report, he would further find that they show that the deaths of those under one year of age, as contrasted with the births, was 9.6 per cent. In other words, of the children born in the colony, nearly 10 per cent. died before at- taining the age of twelve months. That was to say that, out of every ten children born in the colony, one died before it was twelve months old. Now, as we have one of the most healthy climates in the world, that must be very largely the result of ignorance on the part of the parents. There were many young people who were married and had children born to them who were quite ignorant of the laws of health as affecting child-life. The Agricultural Department very properly issued leaflets in- 
<page:325>
saving and of bringing up stock ; and it had occurred to him that, as there was now a Health Department, it would be a very useful thing to prepare and circulate leaflets or pamphlets teaching young parents how best to preserve the lives of their children. He there- fore hoped the honourable gontleman would be able to give him a favourable answer. With regard to the third branch of the question, " Whether he will give consideration to the expediency and practicability of providing cheap maternity attendance for the poor ? " he would say that he believed a number of deaths resulted from want of proper attention at the time of birth, and, as there were those who could not afford to pay for proper attendance, he thought it was a very desirable thing that the necessary assistance should be provided. This also was a subject to which he hoped the honourable gentleman's attention would be directed. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister of Public Health) might say in reply, with reference to the pub- lication of a pamphlet containing rules for the proper care and feeding of infants, such instruc- tions had been prepared in the office, and would be printed and circulated at an early date. He might also state that a lady lecturer had been appointed a week or so ago, who would also visit outlying places, and give instruction in this and kindred subjects. She had been ap- pointed for six months, and he hoped that her services would be of very considerable value in reference to these matters. Respecting the  second part of the honourable member's ques- tion, there were difficulties in connection with it. In Great Britain there was an officer termed the Poor Law Medical Officer in every district ; but in this colony the only officer of the kind was appointed by the Charitable Aid Boards, and his duties consisted principally in attending people in the Charitable Aid Institutions. The honourable gentleman would see that, if the Government were favourable to appointing such officers it would mean the appointment of a great many ; for to meet the necessities of the poor in all parts of the colony would re- quire a great number of medical officers, and this was more than the colony could under- take. He might state, however, that medical officers generally throughout the colony were by no means indifferent as to the require- ments of the needy. In fact, there was no medical man of standing who would not give his advice gratis to the poor if required, or even attend them at times of maternity. He was glad to say that that was the character of the medical practitioners throughout the colony ; but he was afraid it was too large an order for the country to establish a system of what might be termed poor-la w medical officers. To do this would require the appointment of a great many, and he was afraid the difficulty in the way of expense was so great that it could not be overcome. Mr. BOLLARD said the Charitable Aid Medical Officers did this in Auckland. Sir J. G. WARD was glad to hear that was so ; he knew that medical practitioners through- services gratuitously, and they did a large amount of good for which they received no remuneration whatever. As to the latter part of the question, as the honourable gentleman knew, that had been met by the Bill which had been introduced by the Government. HEALTH OFFICER, HAWKE'S BAY. Mr. HALL (Waipawa) asked the Colonial Secretary, When the Health Officer for the district of Hawke's Bay will be appointed ? He believed that all the Health Officers had been appointed excepting the one for Hawke's Bay, and the people there were very desirous that- such an officer should be appointed, so that a responsible person should report upon the con- dition of the several townships. He believed that already reports had been made by officers who were not to be the permanent Health Officers of the district ; but reports from a permanent officer should be made as soon as possible. He would therefore ask the honour- able gentleman to kindly say when he in- tended to appoint a Health Officer for Hawke's Bay. Sir J. G. WARD (Colonial Secretary) might say that the question of the appointment of a Health Officer for Hawke's Bay was now before the Cabinet, and that he hoped a decision would be arrived at at an early date. If a Health Officer was appointed, it would be Dr. De Lisle, who had been strongly recommended. There was one condition necessary, and that he understood Dr. De Lisle was willing to comply with. A diploma of Public Health was required which would probably necessitate a visit by him to the Old Country. All the other qualifica- tions required were possessed by Dr. De Lisle, and when the other requisite condition was fulfilled by the doctor obtaining the D.P.H. degree, he would be recommended for final appointment to the position. RAILWAY SLEEPERS. Mr. GUINNESS (Grey) asked the Minister for Railways, Whether it is true that the Govern- ment have imported half a million sleepers from Australia ; and, if so, does the Government in- tend to continue the importation of sleepers ? He might state that he had no official or actual information as to quantities, but it was stated by some that it amounted to half a million. In travelling along the railways of the colony, members must have seen lying alongside the railway lines at various parts large quantities of sleepers of Australian wood that had been im- ported. He need hardly point out to the Minis- ter that there was any quantity of New Zealand timbers that were quite fit for sleepers, and which rendered it unnecessary to go outside the colony for supplies. He would be very glad to hear a statement as to the facts with regard to this matter, and a favourable expression of opinion from the Minister to the effect that the Government did not intend, if they had trans- gressed in this matter, to transgress again by going outside the colony for railway sleepers. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) 
<page:326>
tion, that probably the honourable member got his information from the man in the street, as to the Government having imported half a million of sleepers from outside the colony. Mr. GUINNESS asked how many had they imported ? Sir J. G. WARD would be very happy to give the information that had been asked for. The department had been importing sleepers from Australia for many years, as far back as 1880, and in some years over 20,000 had been used. Altogether, to the end of last financial year, they had used 172,664. Of late years the im- portations had increased, due to the necessity of providing a better class of sleeper than was obtainable in the colony, and to the fact that the sleeper supply in New Zealand was not equal to requirements. Notwithstanding the fact that the price paid for silver-pine sleepers had been gradually increased from 2s. 4d., the amount originally paid, up to 3s. 3d., the class of sleeper had deteriorated, and the number required had not been offered. As he had stated before in the House, and would repeat now, they required to go abroad for supplies of a certain class of hardwood sleepers that were necessary on the New Zea- land railways at particular portions where there were curves in the line, and, for this kind of work, excepting the best of the known woods in New Zealand, of which they unfortunately could not get sufficient, the woods of this colony were not considered to be perfectly safe. Those members who were anxious to make much of this matter had not the serious responsibility resting on their shoulders that the Minister for Railways had, and if he authorised the using of sleepers of unsuitable New Zealand woods for   carrying heavy trains containing human beings around the curves, and other portions of our lines which the responsible officers reported required timber of exceptional strength, he would be guilty of doing a very improper thing, and more especially when it was borne in mind that the General Manager and the Chief Engi- neer, and their other responsible officers whose advice had to guide them in these matters, had advised that it was not safe for the class of sleepers obtainable in this colony to be used in certain places. The responsibility rested on them to adopt every precaution to safeguard the lives of the hundreds of thousands of passen- gers who used our railways. That being so, it was clearly their bounden duty to do all in their power to insure the safety of the tracks, and he would be no party to sacrificing this for any senti- mental consideration, however great the pres- sure. At the same time, he wished to say that the Government gave preference to New Zea- land woods wherever it was possible to do it. They tried to get New Zealand sleepers all over the colony, and found they could not get as many as they wanted. Moreover, he might state that the price for silver-pine sleepers had risen gradually from 2s. 4d. to 3s. 3d. per sleeper, and puriri at 3s. Od. and 4s. 3d., and even at this enhanced price they were not able to get a sufficient quantity of New Zealand sleepers. Sir J. G. Ward large contractors had asked that the conditions should be abrogated altogether; and, whereas the Railway Department had to depend upon a certain number of sleepers being supplied every year, it was obvious that unless they could depend on a certain number of the sleepers coming in, they could not possibly carry out the railway requirements of the colony, and there would, if this matter was dealt with in a slipshod way, be a considerable risk of the traffic on their lines being dis- organized, or even in part stuck-up at various places. He might say that the department advised him as follows :- "Silver-pine and totara sleepers cannot be used exclusively owing to the fact that the class of engine now running on our lines (weighing upwards of 64 tons), and the increased speed of trains, necessitate the department using the strongest timber. Preference is, however, given to New Zealand timber whenever it is practi- cable to do so without affecting the stability of the road." He might tell the honourable member again, that while the Government were anxious to have, and were in fact, asking for supplies of New Zealand sleepers all over the colony, they had been under the greatest difficulty in getting the people of the colony to supply them with sufficient sleepers even at the price he had named-3s. 3d. for silver-pine and 3s. 9d. and 4s. 3d. for puriri. So he said again, and it was idle to disguise the fact, that we must have a cer- tain number of imported sleepers of the hardest quality it was possible to get for carrying heavy engines and trains with safety round railway curves. In different parts of the colony, many of these engines were 64 tons weight, and drew many carriages filled with human beings be- hind them ; and instead of honourable members trying to force the hands of the Government- by asking them to do away with using hard- wood sleepers, and by their advocacy trying to create the impression that in a particular district or districts the Government were not favouring the use of the local article, when as a matter of fact they were doing so in every instance where they could do so with safety-they should rather strive to assist the Government, and especially the Minister for Railways, in seeing that all the materials used on our railways was of the very best quality procurable, so as to render the risk of accidents to human beings as remote as possible in a colony such as this, where the railways were so freely used by our people. He was just as anxious as the honourable member who asked this question to have nothing but New Zealand woods if they could be used with safety ; but as Minister for Railways he had of necessity to give the utmost consideration to the advice of the responsible officers of the department, and where he was advised that for various railway curves a par- ticular class of wood-the hardest we could obtain-must for safety purposes be used, sooner than take the responsibility upon himself of ignoring that advice in a matter of such moment, and thereby imperiling the lives of railway 
<page:327>
Mr. MASSEY asked, Could not the honour- able gentleman obtain puriri sleepers for the curves ? Sir J. G. WARD said his answer to the honourable member was that they had invited tenders from all over the colony at different times, and if the people in the district repre- sented by the honourable member for Franklin could provide a sufficient supply of sleepers of the class of wood which the department could use, why did they not send in their tenders ? They were prepared to take New Zealand wood of proper quality where it was possible to use it, but they were not prepared to take for par- ticular purposes a class of wood that might contribute materially to the danger of the people who daily travelled over our lines. # VARNISH INDUSTRY. Mr. WITHEFORD (Auckland City) asked the Government. If they will give a bonus to encourage the varnish industry ? He was very pleased indeed to note the energy displayed by the Minister for Railways, and in certain questions in particular showing he was quite up-to-date. As for himself, he did not think the Government would be quite up-to-date until as a Labour Government they could find pro- titable work for every able-bodied man in the colony who required it. The Minister for Rail- ways, in reply to the last question. had said that he was prepared to use New Zealand wood wherever it was right to do so. This being so, he wished now to know if the Government were prepared to take New Zealand varnish as well ; and in this connection he would remark that, when it came to a question of bonus, they said they would not give a bonus to the local article. But what were the Government doing in using the imported article? Were they not paying a bonus to the foreign producer in buying his goods? That was why he asked why, in a country like this, where there was such an abundance of raw material for the manufacture of excellent var- nish, something should not be done to en- courage the varnish industry. In this case it was not a question of the safety of the pas- sengers by railway-trains. It was only a question whether we were to keep in the colony the money expended upon varnish ; whether we should employ our own labouring men in the manufacture of this product, or send away the raw material and the money to build factories and employ the labouring people in other countries. That was why he asked the Government, Would they give a bonus for the encouragement of the varnish industry, so as to assist in building it up? Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) said his answer to the honourable member was that wherever it was possible for the Government to assist in the building-up of a local industry he thought it was the duty of the Government to do so, and if the selection of particular indus- tries for bonuses was to be undertaken, as his honourable friend suggested, then he thought it were to give a bonus to the varnish industry, why not also give a bonus to the coffee industry, to the spice industry, the coal industry, the glue industry, the twine industry, the saddling industry, and every other industry of the colony? If they were to take up one particular industry for assistance in this way, then they opened the door at once to a system of bonuses which would of necessity mean the imposition of heavy taxa- tion on the people who provide the money with which to pay these bonuses. Now, let them take the case of this varnish industry. The duty was 2s. the gallon, and the freight of bringing it from the Home-country to New Zealand would probably be about $2 5s. a ton. There was thus a heavy impost of duty and freight against the imported article, and to that extent it took the place of a bonus in favour of the local article. That certainly was of some con- siderable advantage to the local people who were making the varnish, and it ought to assist them very materially in building up their in- dustry. While the honourable member was anxious to see local industries built up, he was afraid they would have to devise some other way of bringing that about than by the grant- ing of bonuses. If the Government undertook to pay a bonus in one instance, they would have to consider at the same time how many other industries they would extend the same kind of help to. # WOOL-MARKET. Mr. FIELD (Otaki) asked the Go- 4.0. vernment, Whether consideration has yet been given to a scheme recently furnished to the Government for the improvement of the wool-market of the colony, and to follow on and fit in with the appointment of a wool expert or experts for the instruction of farmers ; and, if so, whether the Government approves of such scheme, either wholly or in part ; and whether it is intended to set this or any other scheme on foot for the benefit of the wool-growers of the colony ? The very serious drop in prices in the wool-market would at once make manifest to the House the necessity for some such scheme as had recently been suggested to the Government -the scheme referred to in the question. It had been stated by a Minister outside the House that the scheme had been put forward by some person who was in want of a billet. That might be so, for all he (Mr. Field) knew ; but whether it was so or not, he thought it behoved the Government to do everything possible to improve the condition of the wool-market. As he understood the scheme, it provided for the classification by a Government expert at Wel- lington of all the wool exported from the colony, and the shipping of the wool, not as at present, to the London market, there to be purchased by the merchants, and by them distributed to the manufacturers; but the shipping of the wool to the various textile districts, classed so as to suit the requirements of those districts. It was a scheme that had for its object-an object to be sought in the case of all our 
<page:328>
of which, he was certain, the Minister saw the grave importance. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister of Industries and Commerce) said, Anything that would raise the price of wool by a better system of classifi- cation ought to be supported by every one. The difficulty in connection with such a matter was that the wool was usually baled at the wool- sheds on the ground where it was shorn, and if grading was to take place it ought to take place there. What the honourable member desired was to provide, as far as possible, for the educa- tion of those who baled the wool. Mr. FIELD said that was his own proposal ; but there was a second scheme built on his. Sir J. G. WARD said, At any rate, if anything was done, it ought to be done by the permanent experts who were attached to the Stock Depart- ment ; and if the Inspectors had the requisite knowledge, and could be spared to do so, there was no reason why they should not impart it to those engaged in shearing. The Government were not favourable to the appointment of a number of wool-graders. If a staff of graders were appointed, they would require to travel during a large portion of each year from end to end of the colony. It was a matter that was in the hands of the Minister for Agriculture, and it really rested with that honourable gentleman to take any steps that might seem to him to be practicable. INSPECTION OF BUILDINGS. Mr. FLATMAN (Geraldine) asked the Go-  vernment, Whether any of the Borough Coun- cils have appointed Inspectors of Buildings under section 318 of "The Municipal Corpo- rations Act, 1900" ; and, if not, will the Go- vernment demand that the section be put in operation at once, according to the intention of the Act ? He thought he was correct in saying that there were many houses in Wellington that took in lodgers, in which there were no means provided of fire-escape. It was an im- portant question, that should be looked into in the interests of the public. An Act had been passed by the House, but had not been carried out, with the result that many of the houses were nothing but traps in case of fire, and the owners of these places, if they had what they deserved, should be put in gaol for their ne- glect. Sir J. G. WARD (Colonial Secretary), was sorry he could not give any definite information on the matter, for the reason that the Act did not require such appointments to be notified to the Government, and no notifications of the kind had so far reached the Government. He agreed with the honourable member that the subject was one of great importance, and he thought that his department would be justified in calling the attention of the local authorities to it in order that it might receive attention. RAILWAY TRAFFIC ON SUNDAYS. Mr. J. W. THOMSON (Clutha) asked the Minister for Railways, Whether he is aware Mr. Field would be possible to avoid railway traffic on Sundays ? He was not aware from his own knowledge that sheep were trucked at Pukerau on the day named, but a resident of the place had written to him about it and asked him to interview the Government on the general ques- tion of Sunday traffic on the railways, with the view of seeing whether such traffic could not be avoided. As the subject was one of general im- portance, he thought the best thing to do would be to ask a question in the House about it. He did not know whether Sunday traffic was general all over New Zealand, but, at all events, in the southern parts of the colony there was more or less railway traffic almost every Sunday. It was hardly necessary for him to say that this was not in accord with the religious sentiments of a large section of the community. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) said that, personally, he was averse to the running of trains on Sundays, except in cases where it was absolutely necessary. There were con- ditions, however, in certain parts of the colony where a number of trains were required to be run every Sunday for the convenience of the people. He might state that only recently a circular had been sent out to the District Traffic Managers throughout the colony calling attention to the running of Sunday trains, and asking that they should not be run wherever it was possible to avoid it. That, he thought, was only right. He would like to say, in reply to the honourable member for Clutha, that the running of the particular train he referred to on the 21st of July was unavoidable. It was not put on for the purposes of conveying the sheep, but had to run under any circum- stances, and he was advised that the owners of the sheep had represented that they were anxious to get them away owing to shortage of food, so that the department gave the neces- sary permission to send the sheep by that train. The Government would not only discourage the carrying on of goods- traffic on Sundays, but they would allow it to be done only in cases of absolute necessity. Of course, cases might arise in any part of the colony where, owing to exceptional circumstances such as drought, bad weather, or floods, trains might be required by people for the purpose of saving their stock or their crops, and in a matter of that sort he thought that whoever was running the railways ought to be guided by the exigences of the moment - by what they considered right under the circumstances. At the same time, he felt that they ought to avoid trains on Sundays whenever it was possible, and he had regularly refused his assent to every application for the running of Sunday trains. There were, how- ever, and doubtless would continue to be, cases where it was necessary to make exceptions. GOVERNMENT BALNEALOGIST. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) asked the Government, When the appointment to the position of Balnealogist is to be filled ? This position had appeared on the estimates for 
<page:329>
engaged at Home to fill the office. Up to the present, however, he had not appeared. As there had been some change in the management of the Tourist Department lately, he wished to put the question to the Minister in charge in order to find out whether he was still of opinion that a balnealogist was required, and, if so, whether he would shortly appear on the scene ? Sir J. G. WARD (Minister of Public Health) presumed that by a balnealogist the honourable gentleman meant a medical officer who should be attached to the baths. Mr. HERRIES said the explanation previ- ously given was a general superintendent of all the baths of the colony. Sir J. G. WARD said the whole question of the working of the baths was at present under the consideration of the Government. For him- self, he thought something would require to be done to bring them more up-to-date than they were at present. He did not think, however, that Dr. Kenny, Resident Medical Officer of Rotorna, who had done good work in the past, should be displaced. If anything was done it should be in the direction of getting a man who had had wide experience of thermal springs in the Old Country, to control and improve the baths of the colony generally. It would pay the colony to do so. The matter, as he had already said, was now under the consideration of the Government. RAILWAY FREIGHT ON MANURE. Mr. FIELD (Otaki) asked the Minister for Railways, Whether he will abolish the railway freight on the carriage of manure for the use of country settlers throughout the colony, and thus encourage the improvement of land ; and confer the same privilege on all parts of the colony as has been conferred on those districts where lime is found, and is carried free of rail- way charge ? The Minister would agree with him that if ever there was a time in the history of the colony when the farmers should be en- couraged it was the present time. He was very loth to ask the Minister to carry anything free on the railways ; in fact, he was rather of opinion that nothing should be carried free ; at the same time, as lime was carried free in certain parts of the colony, he thought in other parts of the colony where lime could not be easily obtained, that other manures should be carried free. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) said he must give a similar reply to that which he recently gave to the honourable member for Waikato. He did not think anything should be carried free on the railways; and if it was to become a question whether, because lime was carried free, they should therefore carry manures free, then the alternative was whether the free carriage of lime should be abolished. He might say that the free carriage of lime had not been availed of to anything like the extent that was anticipated. While he thought ma- nures should be carried at the lowest possible rate, he felt it was, as a matter of principle, a Manures and the haulage also cost money. should be carried at the lowest possible rate ; but he hoped that the good-sense of the settlers would enable them to see that some charge should be made for a service that could only be performed at a certain cost to the colony. If they kept on giving free carriage first upon one article and then another, it must inevitably result in the amount being provided by tax- ation in some other form. LAWRENCE RAILWAY OFFICES. Mr. BENNET (Tuapeka) asked the Minister for Railways, If he will during the financial year authorise the erection of suitable offices at the Lawrence Railway-station ? The rail- way traffic at this place had considerably in- creased, and the present accommodation was far from adequate. In bad weather there was no shelter for passengers or people waiting for the train. It was absolutely necessary that improvements should be made. The buildings were not only unsuitable but unsightly in the extreme, and he hoped the Minister would give him a favourable answer. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) said it was contemplated making improvements at the Lawrence railway-station yards as soon as the necessary funds were available. # GREY DISTRICT HOSPITAL AND CHARITABLE AID BOARD. Mr. GUINNESS (Grey) asked the Govern- ment, Whether they will reconsider their de- cision not to allow the appeal lodged by the Greymouth Borough Council against the levy made by the Grey District Hospital and Chari- table Aid Board ; if not, will they state why they refuse to grant to the Borough Council the right to appeal against what is considered an unjust levy ? It appeared that the Grey County Council, which represented the largest majority on the Charitable Aid Board, had made a levy upon the local bodies-that was, the Borough Councils in that county : but, in making that levy, they had not taken into account the reve- nue derived from the rates levied upon mining property. The Borough Council contended that all rates received - whether from mining or general property-should be taken into ac- count in order to base the calculation as to what cach local body should contribute. Against that decision the Borough Council of Greymouth had appealed, and passed a resolution and had forwarded that resolution to the Colonial Secre- tary. Section 26 of " The Hospitals and Charit- able Institutions Act, 1885," made it mandatory on the Colonial Secretary to grant the appeal. He was very anxious to know on what ground the department or the Government declined to grant the appeal. He believed it was said that the same question that was now raised was decided by a prior Magistrate some three years ago : but as the Magistrate's decision unfortu- nately in these matters was final and conclusive, the local body for whom he was asking this question deemed it right that this new levy 
<page:330>
of the law given by the Magistrate who decided the question some three years ago. Sir J. G. WARD (Colonial Secretary) said the position was as follows: In 1898 the Grey- mouth Borough Council, being dissatisfied with the valuation made by the Grey District Hos- pital and Charitable Aid Board, appealed against the levy of the Board on the ground that the Board had excluded mining property from such valuation. An inquiry was held as provided by the Act, and the Commissioners disallowed the appeal on the ground that mining property was exempt from rating for hospital and charitable aid purposes. The Borough Council had again appealed against the levy made by the Board, on the ground that it was unjust ; and the (io- vernment had decided that an inquiry was un- necessary, as the question was decided in the former appeal, and the decision then given was final under the Act. That was why the Govern- ment was unable to grant a further appeal. The matter had been before the Cabinet, and that was the decision which had been arrived at. Mr. GUINNESS desired to call the honour- able gentleman's attention to sections 26 and 44 of "The Hospitals and Charitable Institu- tions Act, 1885," under which an absolute right of appeal was given. Sir J. G. WARD said they had appealed. Mr. GUINNESS said, Not this year, but against the decision given three years ago. If the honourable gentleman would refer this question to the Law Officers of the Crown he ventured to say that they would inform the  Government that the Colonial Secretary had no right to refuse the appeal-that it was an absolute appeal given by the Act against every levy that was made. That was a point, accord-  #cc-zero ing to the honourable gentleman's own state- ment, that evidently had not been considered. Sir J. G. WARD said the honourable gentle- man was asking them to reconsider a former decision. Mr. GUINNESS said, Yes, because that de- cision had evidently been made erroneously, according to the two sections he had quoted. He asked whether the honourable gentleman would obtain the opinion of the Law Officers, so as to avoid the necessity of the Council going to the Supreme Court for a decision. Sir J. G. WARD said he would be very glad to look into the matter. He could only tell the honourable gentleman that the answer was that the decision formerly given was final under the Act, but, as he had said, he would be very glad to further consider the matter. SANATORIUM FOR CONSUMPTIVES. Mr. STEVENS (Manawatu) asked the Co- lonial Secretary, Whether it is the intention of the Government to establish a sanatorium for consumptive patients in the colony ; if so, will he have a report made as to the suitability of the locality of Levin for the purpose : should the report be favourable, will he consider the question of erecting the establishment in that locality ? He did not profess to have any Mr. Guinness informed by a high medical authority that it was thoroughly suitable for the purpose sug- gested. Although his question did not neces- sarily imply that the sanatorium should per- force be located at Levin, one great advantage, if the climatic conditions were favourable, would be, that it was within easy reach of the chief city of the colony, and of the centre where the de- partment was managed from, it also had the advantage of railway communication, enabling patients to be taken to the doors of the esta- blishment without difficulty. Another advan- tage would be that there would be no necessity for the Government to purchase land at a high price, as there were large blocks of Government land in the locality, and also plenty of suitable timber. In fact, all the circumstances pointed to the assumption that Levin would be a very suitable locality for the purpose indicated. Sir J. G. WARD (Colonial Secretary) in reply, said that the question of a site for a sanatorium was a very important one, and when a site was being selected the question would have to be gone into with the view to having the establishment placed in a part of the colony where the climate was considered the best for the treatment of consumptives, and without any other consideration for any par- ticular locality or district. If the climatic conditions at Levin and Otaki were considered superior to those of any other place, then when the time arrived to establish such an institu- tion, that place, he took it, would be selected. He knew it was a very healthy locality, and that a great deal could be said in its favour ; but, as he had stated, in the selection of a site for consumptives, the climatic conditions would be placed before everything. In addition, the site would require to be close to a railway to enable the patients to be taken to and fro with- out difficulty. All parts of the colony would be reported on before a final decision was arrived at. Mr. STEVENS asked if the Minister was in favour of having an inspection made of the locality in question. Sir J. G. WARD said, Yes. He would be very pleased to have an inspection made of that locality, with others. COOK ISLANDS AUXILIARY STEAMER. Mr. HUTCHESON (Wellington City) asked the Minister of Marine, -- (1) Whether the en- gineer appointed to the Cook Islands auxiliary steamer, " Countess of Ranfurly," is a properly qualified person ; (2) what grade of certificate does he hold ; and (3) what rate of wages is he being paid ? Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister of Marine) said the reply to the first part of the question was, Yes. The engineer appointed to this vessel was a properly qualified person. He held a license issued prior to the passing of the legis- lation of 1899 dealing with oil-engine vessels, and under the regulations issued under that Act there were only two classes of certificates for such service-the one was for deep water, 
<page:331>
licenses this engineer held had been equal to that of a deep-water certificate. The wages paid to the officer in question was $15 per month. He was a man who had had several years' service in the class of vessels referred to, in addition to experience in an engineer's shop, and he was the best officer that could be obtained for the position. # JUNIOR CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATION- PAPERS. Mr. GUINNESS (Grey) asked the Govern- ment, Whether the Minister of Education is aware that in the Junior Civil Service examina- tion, which is competitive, and upon the result of which the future of so many candidates de- pend, many of the examiners mark the work of their own pupils ; and that the papers con- taining the candidates' answers are, when valued, retained by the examiners, to be after- wards given out to their pupils as scribbling- paper, to the great annoyance and even injury of those candidates who have been examined ? Mr. HALL-JONES (Minster of Marine) said the question consisted of two parts. In regard to the first part, he might say that the greatest care had always been taken in the selection of examiners ; for instance, none of the examiners for the examination of January, 1901, were primary or secondary school teachers ; and he thought there was no ground for the assump- tion that any of the examiners marked the papers of their own pupils. This held equally for previous years. Secondly, it has been usual  hitherto to follow the general practice in examinations, and to allow examiners to retain the candidates' answers. He saw objections to this course, and had already directed that in future the worked papers should be sent to the department, to be kept for one year, and then destroyed. # TEACHERS' CERTIFICATE EXAMINA- TIONS. Mr. GUINNESS (Grey) asked the Govern- ment, What steps does the Minister of Education propose to take in order to have the examina- tions in music including singing, and in sewing, for teachers' certificate examinations conducted by independent examiners instead of by teachers appointed on the recommendation of a Secretary or an Inspector of an Education Board ; and will he abolish the present system under which the examiners value and decide upon the work of their own pupils ? Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister of Marine) said the department was quite sensible of the disadvantage of being dependent upon local examiners for some of the subjects of the certificate examination. Formerly writing, music (including singing), and sewing were examined locally by examiners nominated by the Supervisors. For the last two years writing and the theoretical part of the music examination had been provided for by means of independent examiners, and a similar change was in contemplation in regard to needle- work, but it was not found practicable to make recent examination. Three out of twenty-three examiners in needlework at the last examina- tion were teachers, and two were relatives of teachers ; these were all at smaller centres. At the next examination it was proposed to have all the needlework examined by one or more independent examiners for the whole colony. As regarded the only remaining subject not thus provided for-namely, the vocal test in music, they had always found it difficult to get quali- fied examiners at the smaller centres. They had had to pay as much as $17 for an examiner to go from elsewhere to examine one or two candidates. These examiners were not ap- pointed by the Inspectors or Secretaries of Boards, but the latter were sometimes asked to recommend a suitable person. Last January three of the local assistant examiners in singing were teachers-namely, those at Whangarei, Greymouth, and Lawrence. The marks for the written paper in the theory of music and for the vocal test were added together. He must remark that the teachers' certificate examina- tion was not a competitive examination. Directions for the vocal test were drawn up by the examiner who set the theoretical part of the paper, and were sent separately under seal to the Supervisor at each centre, so that the same vocal test was given everywhere. ## INCREASE TO SALARIES OF DEPUTY- REGISTRARS. Mr. FIELD (Otaki) asked the Minister of Justice, Whether, in view of the large amount of additional work and responsibility imposed on Deputy-Registrars of the Supreme Court by reason of their having to perform the duties of Clerks of Awards under the Industrial Concilia- tion and Arbitration Act, the Government will provide additional salary to such officers, com- mensurate with such increased work and re- sponsibility ? Under the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act the duties of the Clerks of Awards fell on the Deputy-Registrars of the Supreme Court, and entailed extra work on these officers. The Act of last session, he was informed, put even more work than usual on these officers, and it seemed a very unfair thing that they should receive no additional salary for the extra work involved. Of his own know- ledge he knew that their ordinary duties filled up their time, and he hoped the Minister would be able to see his way to give them some additional salary, as was really deserved. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Justice) said he was not aware that the Registrars did any more work than was sufficient to occupy the time that they had to give to the service of the colony, and, if that were so, then he did not see that any additional salary should be claimed, because they happened to do a little more work at one particular time than another. If their time was filled up by their doing the work within the service hours, he did not think the Registrars had any great grievance. At the same time, he would make inquiries, and if it were found the amount of work they were called upon to do was excessive, he would 
<page:332>
matter would be taken into consideration in framing the estimates. MINE-MANAGERS' CERTIFICATES. Mr. E. G. ALLEN (Waikouaiti) 4.30. asked the Minister of Mines, When the result of the examination held in January last for mine-managers' certificates will become known? Since he had given notice of the question, the examiners had announced the results of the examination referred to. He would, however, take advantage of this occa- sion to state that six months seemed to him to be an absurdly long time between the hold- ing of the examinations and making known the results of such ; and it was a very great hard- ship on the students, many of whom had to wait for the results of their examinations before they could enter into engagements. He was personally acquainted with some cases of hardship. One person had an offer of an en- gagement in South Africa, provided he passed his examination as a mine-manager, and he had to wait six months before getting the result. Was that right? He was quite aware that the Minister of Mines had no responsi- bility in the matter ; but he put the question with the view of getting the Minister to im- press upon the examiners the necessity for being more thoughtful for students' interests, and more expeditious in making known the results of the examinations. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Mines) said the honourable gentleman had himself answered the question. The Board of Examiners met on the 22nd of last month, and the results had been communicated to the candidates. At the same time, he agreed with the honourable gentleman that it was to be regretted that so long a time was allowed to elapse between the holding of the examinations and the making known of the results. As the Board was ap- pointed by Act, however, he had no power to alter the present condition of things, but atten- tion having been drawn to the matter publicly, he hoped that in future the results of the examinations would be issued more promptly. FLAX-GRADER FOR WELLINGTON. Mr. FIELD (Otaki) asked the Minister for Agriculture, Whether it is true, as suggested in certain newspapers, that the Government propose to cancel the appointment of the Go- vernment Flax-grader in the City of Welling- ton ; and, if they so propose, what is their reason for such proposal ? Mr. DUNCAN (Minister for Agriculture) said that some twelve months ago those engaged in the flax industry and representing the Flax- millers' Association waited upon him as a de- putation for the purpose of having a grader appointed. In reply, they were told that if they were prepared to pay a small sum for grading, which would go towards paying the salary of a grader, one would be appointed, and a trial given to their suggestion. The deputa- tion seemed quite satisfied, and they represented Mr. McGowan whole of those engaged in the industry in the Wellington Province. On the strength of that, applications were invited for the position of grader, and one was employed ; but advantage had been taken of his services to a limited ex- tent only. He had instructed his department to send out notices to the flaxmillers that if they did not take advantage of the grader's services, as was arranged when his appointment was advocated, the system would be discon- tinued, and that the grader would be paid off. Mr. FIELD. - It was the merchants who would not take advantage of it. Mr. DUNCAN .- It was the millers that pressed for the appointment of a grader. Mr. FIELD .- Make it compulsory. Mr. DUNCAN said he was not in favour of compulsion. If it was a good thing, they would take advantage of it without being compelled to do so. Nothing definite had yet been done in the matter, and it would depend entirely upon the replies that he received from the flaxmillers how it would end. He was not prepared to continue paying the salary of a grader if those interested were not prepared to take advantage of his services. GLADSTONE ASSOCIATION. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) asked the Minister of Lands, Whether he will place a sufficient sum on the estimates for the purpose of refund- ing to the people who had intended to become settlers in the Gladstone Association the money which was paid as survey-fees? He asked the question at the request of a gentleman in his district, who was one of the intending settlers referred to in the question, and who had written to him in the following terms :- "I hear that most of the members of the association that could not wait for an indefinite period have had their survey-money returned. If the Government had the survey completed anything near the time promised I would have been glad to have got the land for settlement, but as the time went by I had to seek work in other localities." That is what the gentleman stated, and if correct, as he believed it was, then he thought he had a grievance, and that the Government should return the money. Mr. DUNCAN said the Gladstone Association was formed many years ago, and the members of that association were required to deposit the estimated cost of the survey. When the ballot was drawn, certain members of that association withdrew, being either dissatisfied with the lands which fell to them, or for other reasons. Their deposit, which amounted to half the esti- mated cost of the survey, was used to make part of the survey of the block, and it was understood that if the land was selected by any one else, they would get back the amount so deposited. The land was open for many years and was never selected : and lately the Land Board decided to make the sections a forest reserve. It would, therefore, be impossible for the members to get their deposits from any in- coming tenant, hence their application to the 
<page:333>
however, that such a refund should not be made, as they had an opportunity of taking up the land, and the Government was at consider- able cost in surveying the sections, a good deal more than the amount deposited, and, therefore, the members, having failed to carry out their agreement, must suffer the loss. That was the department's version of the matter. If the land was surveyed in time for the members to take it up. and they refused, then the Government should not be made to bear the loss over the matter, when the land had to be turned to some other purpose. Mr. MASSEY .- The man was anxious to go on to the land, but could not wait for the com- pletion of the survey. Mr. DUNCAN said that if the special case alluded to by Mr. Massey was one of special hardship, then he should petitition the House for a refund, and it could be dealt with in that way. LIME FOR THE WEST COAST. Mr. LETHBRIDGE (Rangitikei) asked the Minister of Lands, If he will take steps to acquire and work a lime-kiln somewhere near the Manawatu Gorge, so that farmers on the West Coast may be placed in a like position to the Olago farmers in obtaining agricultural lime at a reasonable cost ? He understood that the Government had a lime-kiln which they worked, somewhere in the South Island, and that the settlers in Otago and Southland could obtain lime at something like 12s. a ton. On the west coast of this Island they had to pay something like £1 8s. a ton ; and any one who knew anything about the matter could understand how expensive this made it for far- mers who wished to use lime when they had to pay that price for it. There was a limestone deposit somewhere near the Manawatu Gorge, and if the Minister could see his way to send some one to look for a good lime supply near the railway, he thought he would be able to meet the requirements of the settlers. Mr. O'MEARA .- Mangatainoka. Mr. LETHBRIDGE said he thought there was a lot of good limestone at Mangatainoka ; and he hoped that something would be done in the direction indicated. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) said the honourable member in asking this question had referred to some lime-kilns in the South. Well, the working of these kilns was not far enough advanced yet for him to be able to say exactly the price which they would be able to deliver lime. They expected to be able to deliver it for about 12s. 6d. Mr. LETHBRIDGE .- They are getting it from private individuals for about that, down South, I believe. Mr. DUNCAN thought the cheapest was about 18s. An Hon. MEMBER. - 15s. to 16s. Mr. DUNCAN expected, when the scheme was complete, they would be able to supply it at about 12s. 6d. But they had been trying improved kilns, and it was a very difficult thing factory commencement in the first instance, but he thought himself it was well worth while to make improvements, and put it in working order. He thought it would be better to await the result of the present operations before going in for fresh works. He might say there was a reserve near Woodville containing 73} acres, situated near the Gorge Bridge. It was offered for lease by auction in 1898, for working the limestone. Opinions differed as to the quality of the stone, and probably that accounted for no one caring to undertake converting it. It was again offered in 1899, but still no tender was received for it. The department would be glad to receive any reasonable offer for working the stone, and making it available for farmers on the West Coast or elsewhere. PAIKAKARIKI ROAD. Mr. FIELD (Otaki) asked the Minister of Lands, Whether he will have a survey made of a new route for portion of the Main West Coast (North Island) Road which will avoid the present steep climb over the Paikakariki Hill? The Main West Coast Road of the North Island was rapidly approaching completion, thanks to the generous treatment the local bodies had received at the hands of the present Govern- ment ; but the one blemish in that road was the Paikakariki Hill. It was an historic place and a most picturesque spot, but for the pur- pose of a road it was far too steep. He only asked now that a survey should be made with a view of ultimately doing away with that steep gradient, not, of course, anticipating that a new road could be formed at once. He under- stood there were several alternative routes, each better than the present one, and if a survey were made now there would be some hope in the future of getting a more suitable route. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) .- Does the road go through Crown lands ? Mr. FIELD .- In one case it does in part. In another case it is sea-coast. Mr. DUNCAN said this road, when opened, would be entirely under the control of the County Council, the Government considering that they had done with it. As to the ques- tion of making a survey to see if a better route could be found, he would consider the matter, because he himself believed the present route was not the best that could be obtained. He could not, however, hold out much hope of any large sum of money being spent in that direction for some time to come, as there were a good many places further back in the bush that were absolutely without roads. It had also to be remembered that the railway-line ran alongside this road, so that the people in that locality, he thought, might do with the present road fairly well for a year or two. The Govern- ment were, however, prepared to assist the County Council in ascertaining whether a better line of route existed. RUAPEKAPEKA PA. Mr. HOUSTON (Bay of Islands) asked the Minister of Lands, If he will take the neces- 
<page:334>
the Natives, in order that the graves of those soldiers who fell in the engagement at that place may be protected ? For several years past the residents in this locality had been anxious that this historic spot should be ac- He held in his quired by the Government. hand a letter which he had received from the Chairman of the School Committee, stating that he had written to the School Commis- sioners in Auckland some time ago asking them to take steps to acquire the pa for an education reserve. They indorsed the opinions expressed by the Chairman, stating that the correspondence would be forwarded to the Go- vernment, with a request that steps might be taken in the matter. Nothing, however, had since .been done. This historic spot was now simply a waste, and overgrown with fern, and he thought it would be to the credit of the colony if the twenty - one acres contained in this pa and its surroundings were acquired from the Natives. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) said the Ruapekapeka Pa was situated on a subdivision of the Ruapekapeka Native Block, and was held under Native Land Court title. The legislation of the past few years prevented the Government from negotiating with the owners for the purchase of this piece of ground. Possibly when the Native Council was in full operation it might consider whether this his- torical place should not be reserved and main- tained, so far as it could be, in its present state. Mr. HOUSTON asked, If he handed the letter he had received from the Chairman of the Com- mittee to the Minister, would a reply be sent   in writing? Mr. DUNCAN .- Yes. # TAX ON STALLIONS. Mr. FIELD (Otaki) asked the Minister for Agriculture, Whether he does not consider that the imposition of a tax on stallions would not do more to improve the breed of horses in the colony than the importation of high-class stallions from England ; and whether the Go- vernment will take steps to impose such tax ? He understood this question had appeared on the Order Paper more than once. There was a very strong feeling among the farming com- munity that the imposition of a tax on stallions would tend very largely to improve the breed of horses. The number of poor "scrubbers " in the country at the present time was, it was believed, to a large extent due to the fact that there was a breed of stallions going round the country whose services could be obtained at a very cheap rate, and were in consequence largely used, and such a tax would have the effect of weeding out the poorer class of animals. This had been put to him by the farmers in a very forcible manner, and he trusted the Minister would be able to give him a favourable reply. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister for Agriculture) said a Bill dealing with this matter was in course of Mr. Houston tax should be levied, and that the proceeds of that tax should go to the agricultural associa- tions to be distributed in prizes for the best breeds of horses at the shows. This would be in the direction of improving the breed of horses in the colony. # DAIRY SCHOOL AT LEVIN. Mr. FIELD (Otaki) asked the Minister for Agriculture, Whether it has been finally decided to establish a dairy school on the Government experimental station at Levin ; and, if so, when it is likely that such dairy school will be in operation ? Mr. DUNCAN (Minister for Agriculture) said it was his intention to have a dairy school on the Levin State Farm ; it was a very suitable place, and with the water-supply that had been brought in should prove a success. The scheme, however, had not yet been definitely decided upon. ## REVALUATION AT HOKIANGA AND KAIHU. Mr. HOUSTON (Bay of Islands) asked the Minister of Lands, If he will cause a revaluation of the high lands between Hokianga and Kaihu ? For some considerable time the settlers had been agitating to have their rents lowered, and he had a letter from a Mr. Hawkings, residing there, who was the last of thirty-five who had taken up land there ; all the others had been obliged to leave through bad burns, bad roads, and high rents. They were satisfied with their sections, but owing to the high nature of the land it was difficult to get a good burn, and that, taken into consideration with bad roads and high rents, made it impossible for them to make a living. Then, in addition to this, their sections were loaded with a charge of 4s. an acre for roading purposes, and very little had been done ; and the settlers had to pay this heavy loading for a period of 999 years. He hoped the Minister would visit the district for himself, and see the state of things there. It was difficult, also, for settlers to get advances from the Advances to Settlers Office. One settler had cleared three hundred acres and put up five or six miles of sheep-fencing, and his improvements ran into €600 or $700; and vet when he applied to the Advances to Settlers Office for an advance of $100 he was told by the Chief Valuer at Auckland that, even if his im- provements amounted to £1,000 he could not These were the kind of get the advances. difficulties the northern settlers met with, and he felt sure the Minister would see that they got redress. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) said the answer to the question as supplied to him was as follows : --- " All the Crown lands between Hokianga and Kaihu, as well as in all the other districts, are carefully valued before they are put in the market. The price at which some of these lands are now in the market varies from 5s. to #1 10s. per acre. No Crown lands can be 
<page:335>
capital value." He could see there was something not quite right in regard to the Advances to Settlers De- partment. He knew the office was very careful, and would make sure in every way before ad- vancing money. It was a hardship for these people that when they went on to bush land and improved it they did not receive more con- sideration ; and he was of opinion that if they got assistance from the office they would stay on the land and improve it, instead of running away from it. He did not think the Board was always judicious, although they erred on the right side in being careful. At present he did not see how anything could be done in the way of revaluation without throwing the sections open again, as it would not be fair to those oc- cupying adjoining sections. He would, how- ever, make inquiries into the matter. LIME-BURNING, ALBURY ESTATE. Mr. FLATMAN (Geraldine) asked the Minis- ter of Lands, Whether anything has been done in the matter of establishing a plant for the purpose of burning lime on the Albury Estate for the use of the settlers and Government tenants in that district ; and, if not, will he obtain a report on the question at an early date ? This question was very easy to answer, because it would take very little to accomplish what he wanted. On the last occasion he put the question the Minister said the Government kilns were about to be opened near Palmerston  South, and after the returns had been got from them he would see what could be done. There was no analogy between the two cases ; the one cost thousands, and the other could be done for less than hundreds. It was necessary that the settlers should have lime on some parts of this estate, and the question ought to be gone into at once. The settlers would reap great benefit as well as the Government, who owned the estate. He did not wish to cast any reflection, but it had come to his knowledge that, while lime was carried free on the railways, in some instances the lime-burners had raised the price to the consumer, and it was therefore necessary that the kilns should be opened for the settlers' benefit. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) said no further arrangements had been made for burn- ing lime on the Albury Estate. An offer was made by Mr. Thompson to establish a kiln, but his terms could not be accepted. He would make inquiries and see what terms had been offered, and if they were at all reasonable he would be inclined to give him the opportunity to see what he could do. He did not think the Government should go further into the matter of lime-burning than they were doing at present. They had a new style of burning under trial, and expected to be able to burn it much more cheaply ; but it was necessary to find out whether they were right or wrong be- fore advancing any further. If Mr. Thompson's scheme was at all reasonable, he would give him, at any rate, a lease for a time to give him a fair trial. Mr. E. G. ALLEN (Waikouaiti) asked the Minister for Agriculture, What has been done towards giving effect to the promise of the pre- vious Minister-the late Sir John Mckenzie- to make experiments to discover the most effective means of destroying small birds, that are so injurious to the agricultural farmers' interests? He had brought this 5.0. question before Ministers on two or three previous occasions. Last session the Minister brought in a Small-birds Nuisance Bill, but it was not considered. He hoped the honourable gentleman would deal with it this year. But that Bill did not go as far as he should like. The object of the Bill was to com- pel people to endeavour to destroy the birds ; but the object of his question was to inform the farmer how to destroy them. He believed the officers of the Stock Department. would do good service to the country if they made experiments to ascertain the most effective kind of poison to be used in destroying small birds, and also the kind of seed that the birds took most readily. The County Councils were spending a lot of money in trying to keep down the small-bird nuisance, and they distributed poisoned grain to the settlers, but it was not effective. The sparrows especially were very clever with their bills. They shelled off the husks and only eat the kernel of the poisoned grain, and, of course. the poison was on the outside. They wanted to have experiments made with some kind of shelled seeds, such as shelled oats, pearl-barley, or sago, or something of that sort, poisoned either with phosphorus or strychnine, or some poison which the department could ascertain would be the most suitable. There was no doubt these birds were a very great curse to this colony, especially in the South Island, where there were blue-gum and other planta- tions near the cornfields. Acres of crop were destroyed ; as soon as the seed was sown the birds attacked it, and they kept on feeding on it nearly the whole time until it was finally threshed. It would confer a great boon on the settlers if the department discovered some way whereby these small birds could be destroyed effectively. He thought, in connection with the Bill, which he hoped the Minister would re- introduce, that some information of the kind he had indicated should be given, and also a de- scription of the poison to be used, so that there could be a systematic process of poisoning at the same season of the year. He believed if the matter was taken in hand in this way we could practically get rid of the small-bird nuisance. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister for Agriculture) said it was perfectly well known that poisoning would effectually deal with these birds, but the trouble was that farmers always neglected the oppor- tunity at the proper season of the year. Gene- rally in the winter time, when feed was scarce, the birds would take poison greedily, and the nuisance could then easily be dealt with. But then the birds were not doing any harm ; and the farmers forgot about their troubles, and the birds were not molested. One man would take the trouble to poison, but two or three of his 
<page:336>
that if we had a compulsory clause in the Bill, and if strychnine was used in the way he had seen it used, there would not be much difficulty in keeping these birds within bounds. We should never get rid of them-they were like the rabbits-they would always be with us; but he thought, at the same time, that they could be reduced to such a state that their effect would scarcely be felt. He intended to introduce the Bill again, and, if possible, get it carried. # MASTERTON COURTHOUSE. Mr. HOGG (Masterton) asked the Minister of Justice, If he will make provision this year for the erection of a new Courthouse in Masterton ? The people of Masterton had been looking for- ward to the erection of a new Courthouse for a number of years. He thought the Minister was acquainted with the present structure. It was a building of wood, which had been erected a considerable time ago. No doubt it had answered very well its purpose in the past, but the business had materially increased. They bad now a District Court at Masterton, and improved accommodation was required. The present building might be advantageously con- verted into a police-station, but he thought it desirable that a Courthouse should be provided of a better character, and something more in keeping with the other Government buildings now in Masterton. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Justice) said he was not aware that this building was in such a dilapidated state as the honourable member led the House to believe. He was quite sure the honourable gentleman was anxious to see that progressive town looking as well as possible by means of the Government    buildings erected there. He would be very pleased to take an opportunity of visiting the district, and seeing for himself the necessity for a new Courthouse. LEVIN AND WERAROA TOWNSHIPS. Mr. FIELD (Otaki) asked the Government, Whether, with a view to the probability of electric power being required at some future time to light the Townships of Levin and Weraroa, and Government institutions in these districts, with electricity, and for the purpose of providing a high-pressure water-supply for the same townships and institutions, a reserve of sufficient area will be set apart on the Ohau River or Makahaka Stream for the purpose of constructing a dam and other necessary works for the above purposes? A reserve might be set apart by the Government, either in the Ohau River or the Makahaka Stream, for the purpose of the erection of a dam, and other necessary works for the purpose of supplying electric - lighting power and high- pressure water-supply to the Townships of Levin and Weraroa, and the Government in- stitutions in that district, when the proper time came. He would point out to the Minister that the district was growing very rapidly, and apparently there was going to be quite a crop Mr. Duncan electric - lighting and water - power would be required. The danger was that the whole of the Crown lands there might be disposed of without this matter being attended to, and he called the Minister's attention to the fact in order to obviate that. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) said the upper waters of the Ohau River and the Maka- haka Stream were Native or freehold lands. Possibly a reserve with a sufficient elevation could be obtained within the Horowhenua No. 6 Block to provide a high-pressure water- supply, and this could be attended to, he thought, when a further subdivision of that block was made ; but this was not likely, as the river left the Crown lands before it attained a sufficient elevation. The supposition was that there were no Crown lands at a sufficient elevation to be of It was all Native any service for this purpose. or freehold land. Mr. FIELD .- Will you see about taking some of that ? Mr. DUNCAN said he would have a report made to see whether there was any site that would be of service. If there was it would be reserved. # PATENT RIGHTS. Mr. LAWRY (Parnell) asked the Govern- ment, If they will take effective steps to pro- tect patent rights against spurious imitations ? The question of patent rights was supposed to be protected by law, but there were spurious imitations by the introduction of a screw or the changing of a crank, or something of that kind, for which a patent was issued as though it were a new invention, but which to all intents and purposes was nothing but a spurious imitation. He hoped the Hon. the Minister would see his way to protect in- ventors in such cases. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Justice) said the honourable gentleman's question put him in a very difficult position, and he was afraid he would be unable to give the answer the honourable member would like. Provision was made by which patentees were able to protect themselves, but the suggestion in the question was that the Government should undertake the responsibility of protecting patentees. He did not think that was a position the Government could take up, unless the fees charged for patents were very much higher. It could hardly be expected that the Government, having granted a patent, and the patentee having the right in the country for which it was granted, should follow that up and protect the patentee when he had the means of protecting himself by the law of the land. WASTE LANDS BOARDS. Mr. LAWRY (Parnell) asked the Minister of 1 Lands, If he will this session introduce a Bill to make Waste Lands Boards elective ? Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) said that Land Boards had under the statute law very considerable powers, and he thought it would be difficult for the Government to keep an 
<page:337>
bability was that the Board would be very fre- quently in conflict with the Chairman, who was Commissioner of Crown Lands and a Govern- ment official, and that members would miscon- strue what their powers were. At the present time members of the House who were members ot Land Boards did not always act in the inter- ests of settlers, but sometimes in accordance with their own political ideas regarding land administration rather than in accordance with the statutory provisions of the Land Act. Mr. HERRIES .- Is it the department that says this ? Mr. DUNCAN said, That was what the de- partment said. They did not understand the Land Act, and he thought it would be rather worse with elected Boards. Then, if the mem- bers were elected they would require to be elected on the same platform as members of the House. Men who had no land would re- quire to be represented on the Land Boards, just the same as those who had land, and what would be needed was a general election. This would necessitate rules and regulations being laid down, and heavy penalties would need to be imposed upon the members of the Board if they transgressed the law, or else there would be trouble. Mr. MASSEY. - We want men who know something about land. Mr. DUNCAN said that was the principal thing that was wanted, and he did not know that they would be more likely to get such men under the elective principle than in the present way. However, he did not think it would be wise to start a new system just at the present time, or until they had made further advancement. WELLINGTON CITY ABATTOIR. Mr. FIELD (Otaki) asked the Minister for Agriculture, Whether he has been officially notified of the selection of a site at Ngahau- ranga for the Wellington City abattoir ; and whether the Government will, before approv- ing of any site, take the opinion of the small butchers of the Wellington District on the sub- ject ? The question referred to the proposed site of the Wellington City Council abattoir. The Minister would fully realise that it was one of great importance ; and, further, that the dis- triet about Wellington was of such a nature that it would be a very hard thing indeed to select the site that would be most convenient to all the parties concerned. He understood a site had been provisionally selected at Ngahau- ranga, close to the Meat Company's works, but that this selection met with a large amount of opposition, particularly on the part of small butchers. The small butchers, he submitted, deserved every consideration in this matter. He noticed from a Wellington paper that there was a proposal from the Makara district to ask the Government to erect an abattoir there. This seemed to him a little out of the way for the present, though it had large advantages ; but he thought that every site suggested should receive the attention of the Minister. He was fully VOL. CXVII .- 21. select the site, but it was for him to say whether he approved or not of any site suggested by the City Council, and he trusted the Minister would express disapproval of every site until he was throughly satisfied that the best site had been chosen. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister for Agriculture) said this was a very difficult matter, and he had gone to some trouble over it already. With a deputation of the City Council and of butchers he had examined three sites. Any one of the three would suit him perfectly well, because the only stipulation that came within his jurisdic- tion was that he should be satisfied that on the site suggested all the appliances requisite to the carrying on of an abattoir in a proper manner were obtainable. Any one of the sites he had seen would do that. They were well supplied with clean water, or water that could easily be made clean, and all were reasonably convenient. He thought, if the small butchers would fall in with the proposal to establish an abattoir on the upper site of Ngahauranga, that would be most suitable, and they could utilise the ground at the other place as paddock-accommodation, as it would not be far away. By having the site on the Ngahauranga Flat they would have a good water-supply, could easily have the railway- siding run to the site, and would be saved a lot of town road-carriage. As he had said, he had no objection to any site the City Council had selected. If they requested to be allowed to carry on an abattoir on a site on which it could be carried on in a proper way, it was his duty to give them a permit to erect an abattoir on that site. He had done all he could to get the small butchers and the Corporation to come to some amicable arrangement, because he held it was for the benefit of the town as well as of the small butchers that the latter should be kept going ; and it was also for the benefit of the country, because if the butchering got into a ring, which it might do -- An Hon. MEMBER .- It has done. Mr. DUNCAN. Well, it was drifting that way. Of course, they knew what that would mean. It would mean dear meat, and that was not a good thing for the community. Not only that, it would mean low prices for the small farmers. He would like to see the small butchers still able to carry on their legitimate work, and hoped the local authorities would also see the advantage of this, and would fall into a scheme that would be suitable for all parties. # WORKMEN'S HOMES. Mr. FIELD (Otaki) asked the Government, Whether any further progress has been made in the purchase of land at Porirua for workmon's homes ? This question ought probably to have been addressed to the Right Hon. the Premier, inasmuch as he attended to that portion of the administration of the Land for Settlements Department so far as concerned the purchase of lands. Some time last year a request had been made by him that the Government should 
<page:338>
such land, and there were institutions there that employed a considerable number of hands-par- ticularly the Lunatic Asylum ; and it was impos- sible for them to purchase from the settlers a single acre of freehold at a reasonable rate for the purpose of making homes. For various reasons, he understood, it had been difficult for the Go- vernment to acquire land in the locality, and mainly because the Land for Settlements Act had not been in a workable condition. Now that was being changed, and he trusted the Minister of Lands would lose no time in seeing that this want was supplied. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) might state in answer that the Land Purchase Board had selected a property, part of which was suitable for the above purpose. Negotiations were in progress to obtain that part, but it might be necessary to purchase the whole, as the owner was at present unwilling to sell the part, although willing to sell the whole. # IMPORTED STUD STOCK. Mr. RHODES (Ellesmere) asked the Minister for Agriculture, If he has vet made arrange- ments for the distribution of the recently im- ported stud stock ? This was a matter of con- siderable interest to the farming community, and naturally they all had a certain amount of curiosity as to what the Minister of Lands in- tended to do with these animals If they were all they were said to be, he thought they would all like to see one or more of them in their own particular districts. He was led to put this  question to the Minister of Lands because he was not sure whether the Premier was in earnest in the statement he made in Christ- church when he was approached on this matter some few months ago. On that occasion he (Mr. Rhodes) had the honour of introducing a deputation from Lincoln College, by whom representations were made that one of the recently imported draught horses should be sent to the College. In reply, the Premier answered that private enterprise had already done sufficient for Canterbury, and their agricultural shows proved that they already had as good stock in Canterbury as were to be found in any part of New Zealand, and that therefore his idea was that they ought to send these animals to the back blocks. Now, he (Mr. Rhodes) did not suppose the Govern- ment would go to the expense of importing these valuable animals and then send them out to the back blocks, where they could only serve scrubby underbred mares. He was quite sure the Minister for Agriculture would not agree to this. He would suggest that they should be sent to such districts as Canterbury, where there were good mares ; and they could afterwards send the progeny of these animals to the back blocks. As regards cattle, he did not think they could send pedigree bulls to a better place than Lincoln College. They had an excellent herd of shorthorns there, and he did not think the Minister could do better than send one of the bulls there, retaining the right of taking, on i carry out the working of the wharf in a suit- Mr. Field Mr. DUNCAN (Minister for Agriculture), in answering this question, might state that he had arranged that one of the Shire horses should be reserved for each Island. It would be sent to some central place easily accessible by rail, and a few approved mares of each district could be sent to this central place by train. The idea was that each district should be allowed to send a few selected mares to that horse at a very reasonable figure. There would be three of the horses for remounts for each Island, and they would be divided in such a way that the various districts of each Island would be fairly treated. He had no doubt that one would be placed somewhere in the neighbourhood of Christchurch - one perhaps about the centre of the Island, and one perhaps further South. As for the bulls, he believed it would be a good idea to place one of them, at any rate, some- where near Lincoln, so that it could be used for a few choice cows. Seeing that the public ought to get as much consideration as possible, he would keep this in mind, so that it might not be forgotten. CATTLE - LANDING IN AUCKLAND HARBOUR. Mr. WITHEFORD (Auckland City) asked the Government, If they will put a sum on the estimates to assist in providing a cattle-landing for the accommodation of the East Coast and northern settlers in some suitable place in the Auckland Harbour? He might say the diffi- culty at present was that the Auckland Har- bour Board had not within their jurisdiction any site that was suitable for the erection of a cattle-landing wharf. But there was situated some distance down the harbour - Okahu Point, he believed-some Native land that would admirably answer the purpose. Unfor- tunately, the Harbour Board had no jurisdic- tion over the property there, so that it was impossible for them to take the land ; and it was therefore for the Government, in the interest of the East Coast farmers and of the northern settlers, whom they desired to benefit and make prosperous, to see that a cattle-landing was provided there. If that were done, there was not the slightest doubt the Auckland Harbour Board would erect the wharf. If, therefore, the Minister of Lands could see his way clear to inquire into the matter, he he- lieved the honourable gentleman would find a very good landing could be provided ; and, as there was so much talk about improving the position of the farmers' products, he might be permitted to say that charity begins at home, and ask the Government to do something for the farmers of the East Coast and the far North. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) might state at once that the Government would look into the matter of this site, and if it was possible to get it and convey it to the Auckland Harbour Board they would be very pleased to do so. He had no doubt the Board would 
<page:339>
sent up to report on the whole matter, and he hoped they would be able very soon to hand over a site to the Board. # MAKURI-PONGAROA ROAD. Mr. O'MEARA (Pahiatua) asked the Minister of Lands, If he will cause inquiries to be at once made into the quality of metal placed on the Makuri-Pongaroa Road, as it is alleged that mud and useless material is being used ? He had no desire whatever to cast any reflection on the gentleman who was in charge of the Roads and Bridges Construction Department, who was undoubtedly a capable man. But at the same time he thought it was his duty, as representing an important electorate, to enter his protest against the way in which money was being absolutely squandered in the construction of roads in his electorate, more especially in connection with the Makuri-Pongaroa Road. In this particular portion of that electorate they had an Inspector. Settlers had come down and waited on the Minister, and had protested against the rubbish which they were placing on this road. He might say the Minister, imme- diately his notice of question was placed on the Order Paper, took steps to have it stopped, as they were simply taking mullock out of the ditch and placing it on the centre of the road, and terming it " metalling." Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) said that inquiry was being made, as suggested by the honourable member, but his remarks were sup- pr sed to refer to a species of sandy papa which had had to be used sometimes in that district, owing to the difficulty of obtaining hard metal at a reasonable cost. In some portions of the   distric; this sandy papa, or whatever they might call it, was of some value if it were put in the right place so that the sun got at it ; but if they put it on the dark sides, where the sun did not reach it, it was of no value at all. He had seen. in travelling through the country, por- tions of road between Stratford and Whanga- momona where sandy papa had been used for making an excellent road ; but then care was taken to place it on the sunny side, where it had every opportunity to dry. Had it been placed on the lee side, and away from the sun. it would, of course, have been useless; and he believed this must be so in similar cases elsewhere. In the case referred to by the honourable member, they had either put the wrong material on the road or else they put it on in the wrong way. He must say, with reference to this district, that the man he had selected to look after its roads, Mr. Robinson, was taken away for other important work. It was to see about those lime-kilns, as he was an expert in that way, and he did not get to work there until the beginning of this winter. But he was now in the district, and he hoped that the honourable member and the settlers generally would feel that they had an officer in charge that would do ample credit to the Roads Department, and he was hopeful himself that # RATING ON UNIMPROVED VALUE BILL. ADJOURNED DEBATE. Mr. ARNOLD (Dunedin City). - Although this question has been debated at considerable length, and from various points of view, I feel it would be unfair to let the matter go to the vote without saying a few words upon it. We have at different times various questions placed before this House, that are dealt with from a theoretical point of view by certain members, who, it appears to me, look at all questions from one side only. It is necessary that every mem- ber should strive to look at all sides of this question, and to weigh it well before they come to a conclusion as to whether it is well to place it upon the statute-book or not. Many ques- tions seem correct in theory, but in practice they do not apply they do not work out ; and yet a person who speaks against some of those questions, or dares to vote against them, is con- sidered by some members unprogressive, or perhaps to have leanings towards Conservatism. An Hon. MEMBER .- Hear, hear. Mr. ARNOLD. - The honourable member for Christchurch City (Mr. Ell) says " Hear. hear." Of course, he knows that I allude especially to him and to one or two others in this House ; and, Sir, I mention especially the question of the elective Executive, the ques- tion of the single-tax, and other questions that are mentioned at different times. Mr ELL .- I am not a single-taxer. Mr. ARNOLD. - I presume if the honourable member for Christchurch City is not a single-taxer he will be considered by some as leaning towards Conservatism, as he considers I am, because I find it impossible to support this measure and some others that he looks at and sees from one standpoint only. But, Sir, on this question we have had a great deal said that does not seem to be in any way related to the subject before the House. For instance, since the commencement of this debate we have had various members of the House quoting the poor working-man. The poor working-man is brought in on almost every question before this House. Now, it is true that the working-man has very much to complain of. It is true that the working-man has certain rights, and has to ask and protest until he receives them. But, Sir, we realise this : that the majority of those who upon questions such as this are continually speaking about the poor working-man are those who do not support the measures likely to benefit him when they come before this House ; and numbers of those who have spoken so much about the poor working- man during the last four or five sitting-days of this House, when questions arise shortly that affect him, will be voting in the " Noes " lobby. Then, we have been told a great deal about the property-tax. We have been told that those who vote against this Bill are practically voting in favour of the old property-tax. Why. Sir, there is no relation between the property-tax and the Bill now before the House. There may 
<page:340>
taxation upon values and the property tax, but there is none between the Bill now before the House and the property tax as we know it a few years ago. Sir, we have also been told in this debate a great deal about what is termed " the fat man." Well, we know that in some parts of the world there are those who have been spoken about- and, perhaps, rightly so -- as "the fat man "; and if a time should ever come when we have large zoological gardens in connection with New Zealand, I think we might well look round and see if we cannot come across such a creature as "the fat man," as others know him, and have him placed in the reserve, so that we may look on him and realise what he is like. At the present time, however, New Zealand knows very little of "the fat man," and as long as the present party remain in power, as long as we are able to pass legislation such as we have passed- An Hon. MEMBER .- The Premier is " the fat man." Mr. SEDDON .- He is still getting fatter. Mr. ARNOLD .- The person I am alluding to will not be known, I trust, in New Zealand. Of course, everybody knows that the honour- able gentleman who was laughed at a few moments ago is received with cheers through- out New Zealand, and that he is received kindly wherever he goes. It is not necessary that we should seek for him to place him in the position I referred to just now ; but, joking apart, Sir, it seems to me there are two sides to this ques- tion. You not only come to the question of  rating on the unimproved value as it appears on the surface : you not only have to consider the question of that which is fair as between benefits received by one section of land and another; but you must also take into con- sideration the question of ability to pay. Members have used various illustrations in their speeches in this debate. Let me follow their example. We have, in the constituency represented by the honourable member for the Taieri, a large number of small settlers --- men who have a small cottage and five or six acres of land ; there are a large number with even smaller sections ; and right in the middle of this township there is a large factory that occu- pies a few acres of land-a factory that is the property of a large company. Now, I think there is no doubt that while it may be contended that it is right that the settler who has five or six acres, and perhaps a cow and some other stock, should pay as much as the company, for the reason that he has the same amount of : Christchurch City (Mr. Ell), and the member land, nevertheless there is the fact that the for Lyttelton, and one or two other mem- mill-owners are the people who are most able to I bers will understand this question better than pay ; and you must consider that question also. ; they do at the present time. What is the Then you come into the small boroughs. On one side of the road you will find a small house. I have a case in my mind's eve at the present time. The small house is the property of a widow, an old lady, who is struggling to bring up one or two children. Right opposite there is a large house on about the same area of land as the widow occupies : the large house belongs to a gentleman who has a business in the city. Mr. Arnold times greater than that of the widow. Now, according to the arguments of the honourable member for Invercargill the other night, be- cause the parties have cach the same amount of frontage the widow must pay the same amount of taxation as the man who has the large house, and who is able to pay rates much better than she is. Mr. SYMES .- Quite right too. Mr. ARNOLD .- I am told, " Quite right too ;" and I have no doubt it is so from that point of view, because only one side of the question is seen. But if you view the whole matter, and look at it fairly, you will find it is not so. Why, Sir, in the constituency of the honcur- able member for Lyttelton- a gentleman who advocates this proposal there is a very large tannery, which is the property of people who do not reside in the constituency, but the re- turn from the output of that tannery is very considerable indeed. The buildings are con- tinually being increased. The value of the buildings upon that property shows that the tannery is paying : and not only the buildings but the machinery that is being placed in them show that. But we are told that under this system it is right that a person owning the same area of land, with hardly any improvements upon it, should pay precisely the same amount of taxation as those people who own this very valuable property. Then, you come to the case of a large city. Why, Sir, you have a large pro- perty in the city- perhaps some large insurance building, bank, or warehouse and you go out into the suburbs, perhaps not very far away, and there you find some little building upon the same amount of land these important buildings stand on. We know there is not the same amount of traffic on the road in front of the small building. We know that the Municipal Council does not expend the same amount in the upkeep of the roads, channels, and foot paths in the two cases. It is always the centre of a city which is the best looked after. Yet under this system those residing outside the city, and who do not receive the same amount of benefit, have to pay precisely the same amount of taxation as those in the centre of the city. An Hon. MEMBER. - NO. Mr. ARNOLD. - I say. Yes. An Hon. MEMBER. What about the differ- ence in the value of the land ? Mr. ARNOLD .- I can only say that I hope. by the time this delate closes, the member for unimproved value ? Is land in a main street the same value as land in another street perhaps only 100 yards away ? Certainly not. The un- improved value of land is the prairie value ; yet in those two cases the owners would pay pre- ciselv the same taxation. But I do not wish to be misunderstood. I simply want to point out that there are two sides to the question. I do not say that the unimproved value is a wrong 
<page:341>
munities, boroughs, or country or town dis- tricts; but I say the people in those districts are the best able to judge whether it should apply to their district or not. In certain dis- tricts it may be a good system of taxation, but I say the Act we have at the present time is sufficient, inasmuch as it permits each district to decide whether it will adopt the system or not. Since this discussion commenced it has been shown that, in the opinion of some mem- , they have just rejected, and which they do not bers, it is not applicable to all constituencies. The honourable member for Avon has given notice to move in Committee that those who have leases shall be examp . Then, there is another amendment which says that all agri- cultural show - grounds, racecourses, football- grounds, cricket-grounds, c. cle-tracks, bowling- greens, reserves or other lands used solely for purposes of public recreation shall be exempt from this mode of taxation. An Hon. MEMBER. - Why ? Mr. ARNOLD .- Why I cannot tell. Simply, I presume, because this mode of taxation is not fair in all cases ; and if it is not fair in all cases, then, Sir, I contend that it should be left in the hands of the people to decide whether they will have it or not. But now we come to a larger question, and let us see what we purpose doing. We have in New Zealand 101 boroughs, 35 town districts, 87 counties, 231 road districts, 35 river districts, and 15 drainage districts, making a total of 504 districts in all, and out of this num- ber there is something like thirty-three that have decided that they will adopt this system of taxation ; and because thirty-three districts have thought it wise to adopt this system of taxation. we are told that almost five hun- dred other districts should be compelled, per- haps against their will, to accept it also. The Premier says that when this Bill goes into Committee they may not be compelled to accept it, because a clause will be placed in the Bill which will enable them to vote themselves out of it. Why, Sir, it seems to me that such a chiuse as that is most absurd. At the present time any constituency who desire to go to the expenditure of having a poll upon this ques- tion can do so. But what are we proposing now? We propose, Sir, to compel about five hundred districts to take a poll, to go to the expense-and in some cases a very large expense -of taking a poll before they can be exempt from this taxation if they so wish to be; and I consider that is a most unfair thing. Then, Sir, take the example which has been given us during the past week: If there is one live organization in the City of Auckland it is the organization known as the Single-tax League. It is not only a live organization now, but it has been for very many years. It was in 1894, and I believe it was previously. It certainly has been so ever since that date ; and, though this organization is so thoroughly alive, the poll which was taken there last week was defeated, and we may take it for granted that the result of it shows the feeling of the people - as far as those who voted in favour of the proposal are con- cerned, at any rate. And yet, after all the work, after all the publications, we find that only 753 persons voted in favour of the measure, and that there were 1,697 against it, or a majority of 944 against-more than two to one. Not only so, but the proposal was rejected in every ward in the city. Why, Sir, in the face of that, I say that we cannot in fairness pass a measure here which will com- pel the people of Auckland to accept that which think it wise should be brought into operation in their city. I thoroughly agree with the honourable member for Masterton, where, in the course of his speech last week, he said, speaking of taxation, that if it had to be altered ! it should be altered by slow degrees. Now, Sir, at the present time what have you ? You have an Act upon the statute-book which compels any borough, by a certain proportion getting up a petition and presenting it to the Council, to take a poll of those upon the roll as { to whether they will adopt this mode of taxation in that borough or not. They are compelled to take that poll, and, Sir, when the poll is taken it is carried by a bare majority. I sav, can we have anything more fair than that ? We talk about "government by the people and for the people"-why, Sir, this matter is in the hands of the people already. Why not leave it there, and not strive to take it out of their hands, as we are attempting to do by this Bill? There was a time, perhaps, when it might have been said that the workers had no vote in connection with these matters ; [ but, thanks to the legislation of last session especially, the franchise has been so enlarged in connection with municipal polls that we have now almost all got this. I should line to see the franchise still broader, although at the present time the great majority have a vote on questions such as this In my opinion, the present law is quite sufficient the people have the mitter in their own hands, where I think it should be left. I think that when we have that which is good it is well that we should leave well alone. Mr. FOWi DS (Auckland City). - Sir, I ought to know something about this subject. It is a subject to which I have given some con- siderable stud., and during a recent visit to Auckland I had the benefit of nightly instruc- tion from the men who consider themselves to be the wisest men in that community. The result is, I have come back to this House more convinced than ever that the only just and equitable method of levying local taxation is by levying i on the unimproved value of land. When speaking on the Address in Reply, at the beginning of the session, I intimated that I believed in the principle of local option, and I still believe in that principle. I am therefore glad that the Premier, in introducing this Bill, expressed his willingness to insert a local option clause in it. Hon. MEMBERS .- You have got that already. Mr. FOWLDS .- Honourable members say that we have got that already. Yes, we have it the wrong way about. Some forty-five polls 
<page:342>
and only in three or four cases has a majority been recorded against the principle of rating on unimproved values. Every one of these polls costs a considerable sum of money, and in many cases the local authorities are deterred from taking a poll simply because of the cost. I say the Government would be wanting in their duty if they failed to make the Bill such that the great majority of places could adopt it without being put to the trouble and expense of a poll, leaving the minority to vote themselves out if they so desired. I would suggest to the Right Hon. the Premier, when the Bill gets into Committee, that a clause be inserted providing that in places where a poll has recently been taken it shall not come into force until three years from the time the poll was taken. This would prevent the pos- sibility of any place being put to the ex- pense of taking another poll in less than the stipulated three years, and, in the case of Auckland, would remove any reasonable objection that the result of the recent poll was upset by the Act. They will be having another poll in three years in any case, unless, of course, there should be a rapid mortality amongst those 753 people who voted for the principle a week ago. I have read with some surprise, and I might say with some degree of pain, the speeches that have been made on this Bill by some honourable members. The speech of the honourable member for Dunedin City (Mr. Arnold) has surprised and pained me. The honourable member for Riccarton, who  I notice is not at present in his place, made a remarkable speech ; but I will not say 1 was surprised at it, because he makes so many remarkable speeches. Some honourable members even say they do not always har- monize with one another ; but his namesake, the honourable member for Hawke's Bay, we do expect consistency from. I believe he spoke very strongly against this Bill a night or two ago, and it will be a surprise to some to learn that the honourable gentleman was in favour of it-and in a compulsory form too - as far back as 1876. In 1876, when the Rating Act was being discussed in this House in Com- mittee, an amendment was proposed to sub- section (5) of clause 2 to omit all the words after the words "rateable value," for the purpose of inserting the following words in lieu thereof : " of any land means 5 per cent. on the amount for which such land without any improvements thereon or thereto would sell in the market at the time of the valuation thereof." That was proposed by Mr. Button ; and on the question being put, "That the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the clause," the Com- mittee divided, and amongst those who voted "No"-that is, that the words do not stand part of the clause-is the name of Captain Russell. There are also some other honoured names in that list, amongst them the name of Sir George Grey, the name of Sir Robert Stout, and the name of, I presume, our old friend Mr. Thomson; so I expect to see him voting for this Bill now. Also the Mr. Fowlds any of the others are still members of this House. When I read some of the speeches that have been delivered on this Bill, coming from members whose interest in the cause of labour is beyond all doubt, it grieved me a good deal, because their speeches showed conclusively that those honourable gentlemen have not given the question the study which its importance demands - especially its importance in the interests of labour. Of course, I do not join with those who believe that labour requires any special privileges. I believe that what the workers in any country need is justice; and therefore, in considering this question and its effect upon labour, or upon any other section of the community, the first question to be asked is. Is it just ? And to demonstrate the jus- tice of this, the truth of the principle that all rating should be upon the unimproved value of the land, is like starting to demonstrate the mathematical proposition that two and two is four. In fact, the justice of it, when put in its proper light, seems to me to be not a matter of opinion, but a matter capable of mathematical demonstration. It surely must be just to collect taxes from that which alone derives value from the services which have been produced by the expenditure of the taxes. That all municipal services the result of municipal expenditure reflect themselves in land value alone, and not in the value of buildings or improvements, is not a question of opinion, but is capable of mathematical demonstration. Every service, whether it be the making of a street, the clean- ing of a street, or the lighting of a street, reflects itself wholly and solely in the value of the site whereon the house stands, and not one single penny in the way of increasing the value of the house itself. The same thing applies equally to the service of a municipal fire- brigade, a water-supply, or a drainage system. In fact, if the Municipality went further, and decided to supply the whole of the inhabi- tants with free gas, and a free tramway service, the result would be identically the same- - in all cases the value of those services 8.0. would be expressed in the land. and not one penny in the building. This is capable of demonstration in this way : Take any property in a given locality, and the value of it before and after a municipal improvement is under- taken ; suppose it increases the amount of the value or rent 25 per cent., burn or take down the house : and the value remains in the site where the house stood. You can never increase the value of a house by one penny from any service the Municipality renders, because it can never be of greater value than it would cost to reproduce it. That is the test. The whole value of every service is inevitably ex- pressed in the land-value. The position, there- fore, is this : If you collect from the owners of houses the cost, or part of the cost, of municipal services you inevitably give the owners of site values something for which they have not paid ; and you do it by making the owners of house property pay for something they do not re- ceive. 
<page:343>
"The Equities of Taxation." Mr. FOWLDS .- My friend has read all the books of ancient and modern history, and is the walking encyclopædia of knowledge in this House : but he has not yet got hold of the fundamental principles of economic law. To go on from the point I was at -- if you give to any one a service without getting him to pay for it, it is only at the cost of those who are paying for it and not getting it : The question as to how this thing will affect different classes in the community is only of interest after you have settled the law of justice in the matter. But it is surprising how the old arguments keep repeating themselves after they have been com- pletely exploded, and when you have explained one lot you find they come back afresh. For example, take that story about this system of taxation letting off the owners of big buildings in towns and cities and compelling the workers in the suburbs to pay more. That was stated very frequently in the case of Auckland, and was denied by those who had made a study of the question and knew how it would operate. But they kept on repeating it till slips were issued to each ratepayer showing how the thing would work out in each individual case. The result was surprising. It came out that in two wards, where large buildings existed that were thought would escape, they would have been compelled to pay $5,000 a year more under the new system than under the present ; and, taking Queen Street  itself, which is the centre of large buildings, only two properties in Queen Street would pay less under the new system than at the present time, and one is a new one well up the street, where land-values are not so high as at the bottom of the street. But when this fact was made known, the opponents said, " Look at these people : see how they are appealing to the cupidity of the smaller holders." They wanted every one to be informed as to how the new tax would affect them; and then when it was done, at a considerable cost of time and money to many of those inter- ested, it was brought against them as an instance of their appealing to the cupidity of the worker. Then, it has been said against this system that it means when you put a tax upon the unimproved value you take all the value out of the land. Now, it is quite true that to put this tax upon the unimproved value will tend to lower land-values-I say tend. I never say it will lower them, because, coincident with the tendency of this tax to lower the value, there is the tendency to increased industrial activity and prosperity by the building of better houses to take the place of slum properties, and wherever you have this industrial activity and prosperity you have rapidly rising land-values ; so that, taking these two tendencies side by side, the latter will predominate, and land-values will continue still to increase. But we are told that the rate you put on the first year will so lower the land-values that the following year you will have to double it, and in four or five years the whole value will disappear; and in recently with reference to Brisbane, where this system of taxation has been in operation for some ten or eleven years; but the reduction there is due to droughts, and not to the system of taxation. I happened to pay a visit to Brisbane last January, and I went a good deal for the purpose of studying this particular ques- tion. And I will say here, and now, that, while I failed to see as many palatial residences in Brisbane as there are in cities like Sydney and Melbourne-and I believe that is accounted for principally owing to the climatic conditions of the place, as the wealthy people prefer living in a more temperate climate to living in Brisbane - I saw more of a better class of workers' homes than I saw in any of these other cities ; and I saw absolutely none of the slum streets that are to be found in these other centres. But we have experience in this country as to the effect on land-values-whether they fall to the extent that is professed by some. I was personally interested as a trustee in a vacant allotment in Palmerston North, which place had the honour of being the first in the colony to adopt this system. That allotment was valued, since the system was in operation, by the Valuation De- partment at $70, and only a few months ago it was sold for £140-showing conclusively, I think, that the system does not kill out land- values in the way some people assert that it would do. Now, with reference to the way that it operates on workers and their homes : Of course, as I said before, I do not hold that that is an argument cither for or against-the justice of the proposition should be the main determining factor. But wherever you get workers' homes you do not find them in the centres of cities where land-values are $40, €50, and $100 per foot. You find, in the majority of cases, that the land is not more than one-quarter of the total value of the workers' homes-the land may be worth $50 or $60, and the building $150 or €200, and in most of the large cities it works out at just about double the present rate on land alone, exempt- ing the buildings ; so that the result works out in Auckland,-and the law operates pretty generally all round,-that about three out of every four of the ratepayers, and these owners of workers' cottages principally, pay less than they pay under the present system. But some people talk as if this question was purely a question for the ratepayers, and that now it was entirely in the hands of the people, and the people most concerned. But, as a matter of fact, there is a large proportion of people in every community who are as vitally interested in this system of taxation-in any system of taxation-as those who are nominally rate- payers, and yet who have no votes on the question at present. English Judges have decided that whoever pays rent pays rates ; and that ought to be the law also in this country ; and if the franchise was extended in the way the honourable member for Dun- edin City seemed to think it was-for voting on this question-then the necessity for any change would not be so apparent. But, as a 
<page:344>
who come within the definition of "rate- payers," by actually paying rates, and people having leases. Well, I say the great mass of the people who are rent-payers are as vitally concerned in the method by which taxation is raised as are the ratepayers, because the pre- sent system means increasing the amount of rent they have got to pay. It is exactly the same with houses as it is with hats, coats, or boots. If you tax hats, coats, or boots, or any other article of use, you make them scarce and dear ; and if you tax houses you make them scarce, and the result is that the landless rent- pavers in every community have to pay more for the privilege of living in that particular locality. Now, I say, while I quite agree that in the interests of smooth ruuning it is de- sirable that the I ill as arranged by the Pre- mier should have the local option clause pro- vided- An Hon. MEMBER .- When did he arrange it ? Mr. FOWLDS .- When he introduced the Bill. Mr. HUTCHESON .- He arranged with you before; and you know how he slipped you up. Mr. FOWLDS .- It will be time enough for those who think the Bill should be passed in a permissive form to vote against it if the local option clause is not inserted, as I certainly should vote against it; but I say, at the same time, it will be necessary for the House to con- sider the interests of the rent pavers as well as of the ratepayers. I do not think my voice will carry me much further, but I think it well the House should consider this matter ; and I do hope those who specially stand in the interests of labour will give a wider study to the question of the incidence of taxation, and how it affects     humanity. It has been said that the Treasury is the heart of a nation, and if the heart is not supplied with pure blood there cannot be healthy life ; if certain portions of the body have too much blood they become congested ; if too little they become anæmie : so the system of taxation, whether it be national or local, is of very great importance to the well-being of the people, and I hope it will receive the considera- tion its importance demands. Mr. HUTCHESON (Wellington City). - I have only a few words to say on this ques- tion, principally to state my reasons for ob- jecting to the Bill. The last speaker, Mr. Fowlds, commands the attention and the con- sideration of every member of this House by his sincerity and moderation in all the causes that he advocates. He certainly is justified, in my opinion, in stating that he had given con- siderable study to this question. I also believe, with him, that the most just and equitable system of taxation is to levy taxation on un- improved values. That it will create apparent discrepancies and anomalies at the beginning goes without saying. But, taking the colony throughout, and being guided by the principle of the greatest good for the greatest number, I believe in the truth of the statement which he makes. But I also believe in freedom, and I Mr. Fowlds mouth that sentiment and act otherwise. Now, we are asked to pass a Bill to secure volun- tary compulsion. That is the position that the honourable member for Auckland City (Mr. Fowlds) has just advocated : voluntary compulsion. That is, we are invited to come outside and get licked ; but we need not come out if we can resist it and stay in. Now, I believe this City of Wellington will at a very carly date adopt this system of taxation. I be- lieve our City Fathers look upon the prospective change with the greatest equanimity. I believe they have already made the necessary calcula- tions to enable them to adopt this particular new system at a moment's notice. I believe in voluntarily adopting such a system of taxation. Wellington will have a large advantage over every other city in the colony. It will attract population, it will cause an increase in business, and it will give a very material advantage to the people, provided the other cities of the colony do not soon follow suit. But all this can be done under the voluntary system. When the Bill was first introduced it was compulsory and drastic from start to finish. But the member for Auckland City (Mr. Fowlds) has assured us that an arrangement has been come to to insert a clause setting forth that any local body may take a poll that the law will not come into operation - that is, the new system of taxation will not come into operation. That is shifting the onus of proof to the objectors. Now, I say, where a change is considered neces- sary and wise, the onus of proving it should lie on the shoulders of those advocating the change. Now, consider the peculiar attitude of the very enthusiastic and sincere member for Christchurch City (Mr. Ell). If that honour- able gentleman is anything at all he is a sincere and enthusiastic believer in local option on the licensing question ; but in this case I ask the honourable member how it is that he refuses to believe in local option. Or, to put it in another way, by a scientific adjustment of the Premier we are asked to adopt compulsory option or voluntary compulsion, whichever way it is. But I would recall to the recollection of the honourable member for Auckland City another Bill of a kindred nature that was passed last year, in respect of which the Premier gave him the assurance that he would permit the honourable gentleman and his colleague at the time-Mr. Collins-to move a certain amendment which they desired. They agreed, and were duped by the Premier into believing that he agreed with and would support the motion they were about to make. Not so; they had to learn a good deal about the wiles of the Premier. He moved the amendment it is true, but he whipped up and headed the rest of his party to vote in opposition to the very motion that he himself proposed. And vet there are people in this House who are credu- lous enough to believe that the Premier is always sincere when he has made a promise. Let me also recall the fact that the Premier has made no such promise as that referred to by the honourable member for Auckland City 
<page:345>
rumour. An Hon. MEMBER. - It was said in reply to an interjection, by the Premier. Mr. HUTCHESON. - But he would have just as little trouble in denying such a thing as in asserting any other thing. The Premier always tells us to trust the people, and in trusting the people, according to the showing of the honour- able member for Auckland City, out of forty-five polls only three rejected the proposals for the new system of taxation. I again appeal to the judgment of the honouralle member, and ask him if it is not as true as it ever was that one volunteer is worth ten pressed men. And if this system is gaining its way throughout the local bodies of the colony, as I believe it is gain- ing its way, why, then, seek to raise all that is antagonistic and hostile in the nature of man by making it compulsory? If there is one local body convinced of its own judgment of the recti- tude of this change, that local body immediately sends out a whole army of proselytisers through- out the colony to advocate the doctrine, instead of brooding at home and nourishing a sense of resentment, as the Auckland ratepayers did on a recent occasion. Now, the Auckland ratepavers were not well advised, in my opinion, in reject- ing this proposal put before them, but they did it, I believe, out of a strong sense of resentment ; and here is one sufficient cause for just resent- ment. I have here an envelope that I am assured was issued from the body taking the most prominent part in the agitation in favour of rating on unimproved values in Auckland -- the Single-tax League. Mr. FOWLDS. - No. Mr. HUTCHESON .- Well, those who may have been in another capacity advocating taxa- tion on unimproved values; and I say that great reforms can only be got by pure means, and the very greatest reform in the world can only be brought about by straightforward and fair agencies. Now, this envelope purports to have been issued with the official imprimeur of the Auckland City Council. It has on the left-hand top corner, in large type, the word "Important," and underneath, in glaring red letters, " Poll Tuesday, 6th August." Then there is the address of the man to whom it is sent, and at the bottom it says, " If not claimed within ten days, return to the Rate Collector's Office, City Council." The City Council had absolutely nothing to do with the business. Mr. FOWLDS .- That is not true. They filled-in every slip that was sent out with those envelopes . the name of the ratepayer, the ad- dre-s of the property, and the amount of the rates paid by the person. Mr. HUTCHESON .- Only at the instance of an interested body of the ratepayers. But it had the desired effect, and it was regarded by those to whom it was sent as being an official document and emanating from the City Coun- cil, and conveying to the person to whom it was sent the idea that it received the approval, the official approval, of the local governing body. | I think this is essentially a land question, and I The result was disastrous to what might other- : consider that we should not waste the time of improved values. But the mistake that was made, I believe, lay largely in the fault of those over-zealous people who, believing that this was a just and equitable movement, adopted questionable means to influence their fellows. I have only to say that no charge of incon- sistency in this House has any dread for me. I am not one of those members who delve into Hausanis to find how they voted on a similar question five or six years ago. I have no care to turn resurrectionist in order to see how I voted on some other occasion years ago on the same question. If I vote apparently at variance with my former views, it only shows that I have moditied or altered my views as a re- sult of the larger experience I have gained in the meanwhile ; and I say now that I do thoroughly believe from conviction that the rating on unimproved values, as far as my experience of city life goes, will advantage the City of Wellington in many ways, and in other ways cause some little disadvantage. Taking it all in all, I believe it would be mainly for the ad- vantage of the city as a whole. Therefore, while supporting the principle, I will do all I can as a citizen to induce my fellow citizens to see the propriety of voting for the proposed new system of taxation. But im- mediately I am subjected to compuls on by Act of this House I am like the proverbial mule : I will kick as hard as I can, and I will vote against the Bill, because it is compulsory, and no amendment moved by the Premier can, .in my opinion, ma e it anything more than a grotesque fiasco. To say it is not compulsor", because you leave me and those who may objcet the right to test our strength of resistance against the power of the law is a paradox. Sir, I will oppose the Bill and for that one and only reason -- that it is to be compulsory ; whereas at present the system is working its way sweetly and convincingly from one end of the colony to the other. I believe that, in the interests of the principle of rating on the unimproved values, the House would do well to reject the present Bill. Mr. WITHEFORD (Auckland Citvi .- Sir, previous to the adjournment of the debate last Wednesday, I intimated to the Government that it was not my intention to support this Bill. Since then the constituency I represent has taken a poll, and my esteemed colleague Mr. Fowlds went north to give them a hand. My colleague, I may sav, is the greatest champion of the single-tax in the colony. The result, then, of the poll was that there was a majority of nine hundred against it. Therefore, after receiving from the Ma or of Auckland the result of the poll in Auckland, I do not feel that I can change my sentiments even if I wished to. I am not going to allow my constituents to be unrepresented while I am in Parliament, and when the majority of me people desire me to carry out a measure which I think is right I will do so ; but if I think it is detrimental to the in- terests of the colony I will not support it. Sir,

able system. I think that what we ought to do more than anything else is to give a rateable value to the Crown and Native lands of the North Island, and, greatly as I admire the Pre- mier, the Minister of Lands, and the other mem- bers of the Government, I must say I do not think they are doing their duty in regard to the waste lands of the North Island. Mr. DUNCAN .- Yes, they are. Mr. WITHEFORD .- Well, I believe they are going to, now the honourable gentleman is Minister of Lands, but they have not done it hitherto. In the North Island we have land enough to accommodate the whole of the British army in South Africa-200,000 men. Sir, we all know that those who take up land are the wealth-producers of the colony. They are, of course, the pets of the labour Govern- ment that we have in New Zealand. Then, why not open up the land we have in the North Island and bring into the colony 200,000 men from different parts of the world to take it up and work it? You would then create a rateable value on the land -- a value that does not now exist - and at the same time you would bring in a profit to the country. Would it not be better to take such action as that, than to waste time here in talking about the single-tax and other questions that will do no good to any one ? Last session many a night was wasted. We sat for thirty hours at one sitting, and passed measures that we have to remedy this year. It seems to me, Sir, the system we have dropped into is most absurd, and instead of  pursuing it further we should go to work, and in a practical manner do something that would benefit the people of the colony as a whole. In the first place, we might take up the land for     settlement question. Instead of going to the South Island, where a great quantity of the land has been bought by Government from private people, let us draw the attention of the young men to the virgin lands of the North Island. Let these young men take up this land as their fathers did in the old days ; let them improve it, as their fathers did in the South ; let them take up large runs, and in the next quarter of a century they will be able to sell their land as improved land-round about the cities created by the construction of railways, or the making of roads for the settlement of the interior of the North Island. Why, we are pursuing at the present time a policy of stag- nation. So much so, that when a few hundred men come back from the war in Africa they cannot find employment, and as our boys leave school you see them walking about the towns unable to get employment. There is no sadder sight than to see a youth come back daily to his home and tell his father that he cannot get work. I say that the whole of the returned contingents-some two thousand men- might be put on survey-work, or road-construction, or prospecting for gold in the country between the Waihi Mine and Wellington, where there is one of the richest auriferous belts in the whole world. We have got more unimproved land in the North Island than they have in i encourage all the different industries, and then Mr. Witheford waste land in the Province of Auckland than there is in the Province of Wellington. It is necessary that I should point these things out, or I can hardly expect to receive the approval of my constituents. I may here say that the speech of the Hon. the Minister of Lands -- Mr. Duncan-on the resolution of con- dolence with the relatives of the late Sir John Mckenzie, was, I think, the finest speech made on that occasion. I trust the honourable gentle- man will rise in his strength, and declare that he is going to pursue a policy of land-settlement and progress; that he is going to lift New Zealand out of any possibility of stagnation or shortness of money, or anything of that kind. If he does that the people of the North Island will in the future be as grateful to the Hon. Mr. Duncan as the people in the South have been grateful to the late Sir John Mckenzie. The Hon. Mr. Duncan has visited the different dis- tricts of the North Island, and he knows the magnificent resources of the country. The Minis- ter for Public Works has visited the interior of the North Island, and has admitted that he there saw the best land in the colony. Why should not the young men of the South Island have an opportunity of settling upon that land ? I say the young men of the South Island ought to have the same advantages as the old men in the South Island have had-such grand men as they were too. I say that the young men should have just the same opportunity to acquire the waste lands and the virgin lands as the old settlers had ; and, in regard to this matter, I fear that the present Government are standing in the way of settlement. I say that they are not giving the sons of the colony a good " show." They should take up all this magnificent land and throw it open for settle- ment, and, if the young colonials do not want it, invite people to come from all parts of the world with their money to settle here and spend their money here. I believe the title of this Bill is "The Rating on Unimproved Value Bill "-in other words, the single-tax. For many years I have endeavoured to solve this question of the single-tax. I have been in Aus- tralia amongst the single-taxers, with very en- thusiastic single-taxers-men who are amongst the staunchest of the members of that party- ard I have been unable to follow their argu- ments or to understand their line of reasoning. And, in regard to this question. although my colleague Mr. Fowlds is a gentleman I esteem very much, I regret that on certain main points I have to differ from him. I do not think that in the present condition of things the single-tax is what we want, and therefore I think it is only a waste of time to discuss the matter at all. We have passed enough legislation to last us for many years, and I trust this House will \- not waste further time by dealing with experi- mental legislation. My sympathies go out to the young men, and, seeing the grand Premier we have got, I would like to see him do some- thing practical to enable the young men to | make homes for themselves, to find work. to

place on earth for the English-speaking races to inhabit. Mr. SYMES (Egmont) .- Sir, I do not intend to follow the example of my worthy friend who has just sat down-traverse the whole of the land policy of the colony on the second reading of this Bill. Sir, I think that this Bill, to begin with, is going in a practical manner. Now. I can speak with some authority of a district which has carried the rating on the unim- proved value, and I say that we have more work than people there to do it. We could give labour to a number of people, but we cannot get them when wanted. The honourable mem- ber for Auckland City deplored the fact that the Government was not finding work for the young men who have returned from South Africa ; and I think that their first duty should have been to have seen that the young men who have done so well should get away back to their old employment, and not loaf about the towns. It would be much more to their in- terest and to the advantage of the country. Mr. WITHEFORD .- Many had not got em- ployment to go to. Mr. SYMES .-- Some of them had, and could have gone back to it had they liked. I look on this so-called rating on the unimproved value system as a misnomer. There is no such thing as an unimproved value. Since the day that Captain Cook landed from his ship on the shore of this colony there has been an improved value in the colony. At any rate, since the first shipload of people landed in this colony there has been an unimproved value placed on every acre of land in the colony. But it is wrong to say there is an unimproved value. Call it a " prairie " value, and you get the right thing.   Some people have very strange ideas on the subject of the single-tax. We have seen single- taxers -- theoretical single-taxers -- practical. Now, I am a single-taxer, and I own land, and I am quite as staunch a single-taxer as my honour- able friend the member for Auckland City (Mr. Fowlds), but the single-tax is in the dim and distant future ; but it will come in the end. This is not the time nor the place to discuss the single-tax. The Bill that we have before us is for rating on unimproved value. I think the member for Wellington City (Mr. Hutcheson) tried very hard just now to put a wrong con- struction upon an envelope, or circular, as show- ing that some one had tried to "pull the legs " of the electors of Auckland, and he "fell into the soup." That is really what he is trying to get at, whereas nothing of the sort had occurred. Now, Sir, like Mr. Hutcheson, I never look inside Hansard, for I get enough of its contents in the House. I do not care a scrap about ancient history-I do not care how a man voted last year or the year before. He may alter his opinion ten times a year for all I care. We know that the honourable member for Welling- ton City (Mr. Hutcheson) had not been long in this House before he found occasion to alter his opinion. The question of rating as at present amounts to this : Is it just and fair that a man should have a tax placed upon his thrift and to rate on unimproved or prairie value ? I say, Yes, it is; no man should be taxed for putting improvements on his land. One honourable gentleman said the other night, " But a man might put up a stable with a marble floor." I say, more power to him. He has been taxed for the improvement, then why tax him again? And we have heard of "the fat man " who builds a mansion. I will give another case of "the fat man " -- the man who owns thousands of acres of land, on which he has only a whare. He may run nothing but cattle on it, or thousands of sheep, which he takes to his neighbour to be shorn. He pays the lowest rate possible, and does his level best to get his neighbours to be taxed to make roads for him. I will give a particular instance from my own district. A gentleman from Christchurch bought a section of land near to my own pro- perty, for which he paid £1 an acre. He never did a stroke of work upon it, and did not even put a fence around it. After he had kept it some four or five years I worked out the in- terest and rates he paid on it, and found they amounted to about 15s. or 16s. When a purchaser offered to buy it he refused $4 an acre. We made gravel roads for him, and were taxed on £4 and £5 an acre, and some higher even than that, while he was paying at the rate of #1 only. A small portion of land was wanted in that locality for a cemetery, and it was thought that a portion of this man's land could be got for the purpose. The local body was thinking of taking it under the Public Works Act ; but before doing so he was written to. His reply was that he would sell five acres, but that he would want 420 an acre. That is how the present system of taxation works out. I will show honourable members how the poll for rating on the unimproved value was rejected in Stratford on the first occasion. At the time we had two large holders of land on the County Council, who made it their business to go round the district advising people to stay away from voting in order that the poll should be lost. But it is quite immaterial, so far as I am per- sonally concerned, whether this Bill is carried or not, because we have carried the rating on unimproved value. But it is a question of whether it is just or unjust, and I say rating on the prairie value is the only just and equi- table mode of taxation. I hate taxes myself, and if there is any man who says he likes taxes- well, I have my own opinion as to his truthful- ness or otherwise. But, if we must have taxes, the only fair thing we can tax is that which none of us have produced. That is the land. The men who build mansions are the men we want in this country, because they employ every description of labour under the sun. Then, why should they be taxed for ever on that employment ? They are taxed heavily enough in the first instance when they build the mansions. I say the taxing of a man's improvements on his land is legalised robbery. That is my opinion. Now, it has been asked by some honourable members, "What is the use of building more houses in the cities when 
<page:348>
houses." Go round this city and see if there are plenty of houses. What are they ? Why, some of the so-called houses are hardly fit for stables. Sir, the very fact of passing this Bill will be the means of giving many of the poor people represented by Mr. Arnold -who is opposing this Bill-houses fit to live in, instead of houses fit merely for cattle. But as to many of the houses one sees here- well, it is wrong to say I should like to see a fire ; but, at any rate, they ought to be swept off the face of the earth. I say the small farmer knows how to vote when it comes to a question of rating on unimproved or improved values. In one portion of the County of Stratford there were over a hundred votes cast in favour of rating on unimproved value and not one against it, and all those who voted were small farmers. A small farmer owning, say, a hundred acres of lund, and who has a wife and family, has to erect a house and other buildings to house his family comfortably and respectably and to en- able him to carry on his business. He has to improve his land a great deal more than has the man with a thousand acres. He proceeds to log and stump his land at once, while the man with a thousand acres waits for the fires to do it. Then, again, the man with a thousand acres puts up exactly the same amount of building; and how much per acre does he add, as against the man with a hundred acres ? I sav, every time, rating on the unimproved value is in favour of the small man, and I hope ; the time is not far distant, when the whole colony, from end to end, will have adopted this system of rating as the most just and equitable system of taxation ever thought out, and one that should be approved by every right-think-   ing man in the colony. For myself, I intend to vote for the second reading of the Bill, not that I think it necessary, because, as I sav, the ratepayers can, if they wish, carry it. We have tried it twice in my district, and have succeeded at last ; so, in my electorate, I do not care whether the Bill is passed or not. At any rate, I shall vote for its second reading, which I hope will be carried ; and when in Committee it can be amended to meet all requirements. Mr. WITHEFORD (Auckland City). -- I wish to make a personal explanation. The honour- able gentleman said that all those who have returned from the war can go back to their em- ployment. I wish to point out that is not cor- rect. One man came to me-a blacksmith- willing to take work of any description, and he has taken work as a pick-and-shovel man on the Main Trunk Railway rather than it should be said he was seeking work and praying not to get it. If my honourable friend is willing to give work to these men, I will send him two hundred if he will undertake to find them work. Mr. COLLINS (Christchurch City) .- Sir, I should like to say at once that I am not an opponent of the principle of rating on unim- proved value. At the same time, I am not going to vote for the second reading of this Bill, because I think it does exactly what we said in the original Act of 1894 should not be done, : any measure which I thought was intro- Mr. Symes people themselves, and it was for them to say whether or not the principle should be put into I have listened to some of the operation. speeches to-night with a very great deal of pleasure, and to one or two with some little amusement. We have had two speeches from two members for Auckland. I listened to the speech of the junior member, and I did my level best to follow him through the intricate mazes through which he led us ; but, en- deavouring with all my power to be on the alert, I failed absolutely to see the slightest connection between his speech and the subject It is true he indulged, as under discussion. he always does, and as he is quite justified in doing, in a high eulogium on the part of New Zealand from which he comes; and the House was not at all surprised, I dare say, to hear him indulge in an almost equally high eulogium of the Ministers on the Treasury benches. I listened to his re- marks in regard to the Premier, and followed him with amused interest when he came to speak in glowing terms of the possible future of the present Minister of Lands ; and when he suggested a possible time when the honourable gentleman should be Sir Thomas Duncan I almost expected him to conclude his remarks with "And now, gentlemen, charge your glasses." Mr. WITHEFORD .- The wish was father to the thought. Mr. COLLINS .- The honourable gentleman's shaft, though well meant, misses its mark. He knows I am one of those unfortunate people who cannot partake of his hospitality, being a total abstainer; so the honourable gentleman will have to try again. Now, Sir, of all the speeches delivered to-night, I followed with great interest the speech of my friend the member for Auckland City (Mr. Fowlds). We have been reminded that quite recently this subject has been brought into special prominence by virtue of a vote taken in the city represented by the honourable member referred to, and that vote was very largely cast against the principle embodied in this Bill -rating on the unimproved value. I 1 believe it will be generally admitted, Sir, that the hostile vote was not so much against the principle of rating on the unimproved value as against the principle of the single-tax. But, Sir, what I want to point out is this : that the most enthusiastic supporters of this Bill as it now stands are determined single-taxers, and I am sure it will be quite impossible either for the House or the country to disassociate the fact that this Bill in its present compulsory form is an endeavour to drive the principle of single-tax one little bit further home. I do not think the single-taxers themselves in the House will deny this. Now, Sir, while I am in favour of and would support the rating on the un- improved value, I am not prepared to go so far as to commit myself to the principle of the single-tax; and I should resist, and resist as strenuously as I possibly could, 
<page:349>
Auckland City (Mr. Fowlds) told us that after he had listened to the speeches delivered he was more convinced than ever that the only just principle of taxation was taxation on the unimproved values of land ; and I would ask him, and I would ask honourable members, if they are convinced that this is the only just principle on which taxation should be levied, are they not prepared to submit the justice of that principle to the people? Will not the people themselves perceive that justice? I have never known the people so stupid and blind in their own interests that it was necessary you should thrust justice upon them ; and I think the people in this mat- ter. as in other matters, are to be trusted to discern the justice of it for themselves. The honourable gentleman said, when reminded at the time, that he recognised that the people had permissive power to put the system into operation ; but he said the permis- sion was the wrong way about. The people now have the right to say whether or not they will adjust their taxation on the unim- proved value of lands ; and that is a direct vote of the people on an affirmative principle, and the honourable gentleman would submit the vote on a negative proposition. Who ever heard of the people being asked to vote on a negative proposition ? We ought to consider the people in this matter, and we ought not to expect them to vote against this thing unless it is put before them as an affirmative principle. They now have the right to vote against an affirmative principle, but surely they have no right to be ex- pected to vote on a merely negative proposition. Now, Sir, we have been told over and over again to-night that out of some 500 rateable districts in New Zealand only thirty-five had put the principle into operation. I do not regard that as telling against the principle of rating on the unimproved value, because I believe that number will grow steadily and steadily, and I am quite sure that, growing in that way, it will give rise to much less friction and much less dissatisfac- tion than it would be likely to if imposed on the people by statutory law. But, Sir, what sur- prised me most was to hear the honourable mem. ber for Auckland City- and he will pardon me if I say that he seemed to treat honourable mem- bers who oppose this Bill, while not opposed to the. principle of rating on the unimproved value, in a somewhat cavalier manner. Although we were led to understand that the honourable gentle- man was suffering from a somewhat severe cold, I really thought-my honourable friend will pardon me for referring to him as the lead- ing apostle of single-tax in New Zealand -we should have had a flood of light thrown on this Bill that would have been absolutely and over- whelmingly convincing ; but, Sir, we did not get it. And, although the honourable gentle- man was surprised at the speeches of 9.4. those who represent labour, I must confess I was equally surprised at the speech of the honourable gentleman who represents the single-tax. He said that he believed in I say, that being so, are not the people them- selves the best judges of what is just in prin- ciple for them ? They have the right to vote now. An Hon. MEMBER .-. Not the people. Mr. COLLINS .- Yes, the people ; the same people who will be affected when this Bill be- comes law-exactly the same people. Then the honourable gentleman went a little further. He said taxation should be on everything which derives value from the expenditure of the taxa- tion ; and I agree with him. He then went on to declare that property in no way is benefited from the expenditure of taxation. Now, Sir, while there is some truth in what the honour- able gentleman says, it is not all truth ; for, while it may be perfectly true that the actual value of a building depreciates-that the actual value of a factory as a building, or, if you like, a tannery as a building, and so on, will depreciate - year by year, nevertheless the factory or build- ing that is utilised for a particular kind of work is increased in value through the expenditure of public money. Not only has the land in- creased in value, but the building has a fac- tory value, quite apart from the value of the site upon which it stands, and which is given to it by the very roads which the taxes have made ; and the tannery or factory would be absolutely useless were the roads allowed to fall into such disrepair that it would be impossible to get the raw material to or the manufactured goods away from it. The honourable gentleman must see that he cannot dissociate the expenditure of public money from the increased value of a factory as a wealth-producing concern. Then, the honour- able gentleman said he would like to show how this Bill would affect workmen's homes. Now, I know the difficulty of attempting to prove any position by merely quoting isolated ex- amples. It is possible to quote any number of statistics both in favour of and against this proposition ; but I want to point out this : that were we starting de uevo, were we founding an entirely new community, a community which should grow up under the operation of this Bill, I could understand fully the justice of what the honourable gentleman says. But the question is now one of applying this principle to dis- tricts where already serious anomalies exist which this Bill would not remove, but, in many cases, would intensify : I mean the matter of compelling the people to carry out this principle of rating on the unimproved value. Take, for instance, the immediate surround- ings of one of the centres of population. The matter has been referred to before, and I have no intention of wearving the House. You will find in the immediate suburbs, and within the boundaries of a city like Christchurch, a quarter-acre section held by a working-man, who has built a house upon it costing, say, 2200 or $250. He has taken the quarter-acre section because he wishes to grow upon it the vegetables required by his family. The very next quarter-acre section will be occupied by, probably, a much wealthier individual, who has 
<page:350>
beds. Now, both these individuals are to be rated upon exactly the same rateable value. Now, I want an answer to this question : How are they going to adjust that with the principle we have all along contended for-the "equality of sacrifice"? Where is the equality of sacrifice to the man who has taken the quarter-acre section because it will enable him to supplement a low wage to maintain his grow- ing family? And if we want growing families you will have to give facilities for keeping them. There is no doubt whatever about that. I ask, How are they to adjust this with the accepted principle of equality of sacrifice when you com- pare the case of a man using his full quarter- acre for the benefit of his family, with the case of his next - door neighbour, who allows his quarter - acre to be laid out in lawns and flower-beds ? If it is said, as it probably is, and will be again, that the man who builds a $600-house employs labour and spends money, then, Sir, I say again that in many cases the money is merely spent for gain. It is spent to obtain a return. Men do not build larger houses philanthropically. They are not built for the purpose of employing labour and keep- ing working-men going. They are built because they are a good investment, because they bring in good returns ; there is no doubt whatever about that. And I want to know why any man with a quarter of an acre that he uses for growing cabbages and other produce should be charged at as high a rate as the man who builds a house for $600 and draws $80 rental from it. I say, again, that while in the main I agree with the principle of the unim- proved value, and while I personally would vote for it in my own locality, I again say that it will not remove all anomalies. If that be so, and there will still continue to be anomalies, then I think it will be infinitely better to leave it for each district to say for itself whether it shall or shall not put this principle into opera- tion. These are my only reasons for opposing the Bill. The people already have the power to put the principle into operation if they so desire, and I think that is a better way of deal- ing with a measure which will not remove the anomalies that already exist. Mr. GUINNESS (Grey) .- There is one phase of this question which I do not think has been brought with sufficient prominence under the notice of the House, and, through this debate, the country ; and that is this : I hold it is a proper principle that all taxation should be uniform, and should be levied upon a uniform basis. One great question that was decided by this House when the present Liberal party came into power was that the property-tax should be abolished, and we laid down the principle that the unimproved value only should be taxed for the purpose of getting a revenue for the colony. Then, we laid down the principle that it should be followed in all branches of taxation for the purpose of getting revenue. A mistake, I think, was made at that time in not providing that all rates should Mr. Collins on the unimproved value of the land by local bodies was adopted by this House, and the original idea was, no doubt, to pass an Act that should make it compulsory ; but it was thought that such a measure would not be adopted by the other branch of the Legislature. Hence it was not made compulsory when the land-tax was passed ; it was passed for gene- ral Government revenue purposes. A certain number of members who are opposed to the principle of rating on the unimproved values are using all sorts of arguments against this Bill being passed. Another set of members who profess to be supporters of the principle- whether they are sincere or not in that support I doubt-say they are not going to vote for this Bill because it takes away power from the people; yet these are the honourable mem- bers who wish to trust the people. The answer to their argument, I maintain, is this : that if you are going to trust the people let the people have the right to vote on that question. The people are not now allowed to vote on this question. It is only those who pay rates who are entitled to vote, and you are still making the tenant, the lodger, and the boarder pay higher rates for his weekly rental, and for his weekly lodging, and weekly board ; because you are maintaining this old system of taxation, which was shown to be so wrong when we repealed the property-tax and placed the land- tax upon the statute-book-you are maintain- ing this old system, which caused the rents of buildings in different parts of the colony to be at an excessive rate. An Hon. MEMBER .- This Bill will not extend the franchise. Mr. GUINNESS. - No, this Bill does not apply to that question ; and honourable mem. bers must remember this fact : that all those who have said that the effect of this Bill will not be to decrease rents must be making a mis- take, because the examples quoted, particularly by the honourable member for Christchurch City (Mr. Ell) and the honourable member for Lyttelton, all go to prove that if this Act passed, and we had nothing but rating on the unim- proved values, we would find that the rates of those who hold small buildings - particularly those who live in cottages-would be decreased by 50 and 75 per cent. Now, if the rates are decreased on these cottages, we have a right to ask that the rents should also be decreased. This is another way of looking at the question of reducing the rents. Is it not a fact in large centres, where there is a difficulty in getting cottages, that people frequently let hovels and collect high rents, because tenants are forced to occupy such places on account of suitable buildings being so hard to get? But if there Were numerous buildings of a substantial kind, and the people could get them at less rents than they are paying for these hovels, then we would find that the rents would go down. What encouragement is there for people to erect substantial and decent buildings ? The rates on every building that is put up on a 
<page:351>
because the buildings and improvements are rated. It is the property-tax over again. I ask, why maintain the system of property-tax for local general rates and abolish it for General Government revenue? As for those who say we should trust the people: Do we go to the people and ask them what kind of taxation this Parliament shall impose on them ? If you are going to apply the principle of going to the people as to local rating, you should also apply it to colonial taxation. One of the principal arguments in favour of this Bill is that you have differential systems of levying rates all over the country. Is that wise, is that politic ? Is it wise that you should have on one side of a road one system of levying taxation, and on the opposite side of the same road another system ? You have in thirty-three or thirty-four local bodies of the country un- improved-value taxation levied ; and in all the others you have the old property-tax system of rates being levied. Is it right that you should have those different kinds of rating ? I think not. Then, again, there is the differ- ence between the local and the General Govern . ment system of rating lands. I contend that this should be done away with, and I hope the Government are determined to try and place this measure on the statute-book. I believe that the Premier is even giving way too much to those who are opposed to the principle of rating on unimproved values. He has even offered to agree that any locality which likes to have this Act suspended from operation may do so by taking a vote of the ratepayers. There are a number of localities where the majority of the people are in favour of the unim- proved value system of taxation; but these localities of local bodies would not go to the expense, and would not go to the trouble of voting to bring the Act into operation be- cause of that expense and that trouble. There- fore it is the duty of this Parliament, I take it, to lay down one system of taxation, and one only ; and to concede the offer the Premier made, in answer to the member for Franklin, is, I think, conceding more than should be con- ceded. There is another important provision that I fail to see in this measure, and I hope, when the Bill gets into Committee, the Premier will be prepared to bring down a clause so as to amend "The Rating on Unimproved Value Act, 1896," by making the whole of the rates collectable under this system, and not to have the general rates collected under this system and the separate rates under the old system of the property-tax. I shall not take up further time, but I shall cordially support the measure, and trust it will be placed on the statute-book. Mr. FIELD (Otaki) .- Mr. Speaker, this Bill contains in the main two provisions, both in- cluded in clause 2, subclause (1) of that clause, making rating on the unimproved value com- pulsory. That is the main clause of the Bill. Then, subclause (2) of clause 2 renders it optional on the part of a local body to have its water-rates, gas-rates, charitable-aid rates, and levied on the unimproved value. Now, Sir, I may say straight out that I agree with the principle of rating on the unimproved value, and I disagree entirely with the senior member for Wellington City and others who have spoken in the attitude they have taken up on this matter. They admit the principle of rating on unimproved values, but they are not prepared to admit that the Rating on Unimproved Value Act of 1896 is placed the wrong way on. I think, if we admit the principle, we should be logical, and say that rating on the unimproved value shall be the law; and that if any local body, for reasons affecting the district under its control, desires to exempt itself from that law it may do so by a vote of the rate- payers under a special section of the Bill. That is what I understand the Premier pro- poses to do, and it is on that understanding that I shall vote for the second reading of the Bill. If I studied my district only, and not the colony as a whole, I believe there is no member of the House who would have better reason for voting against the Bill than I have ; but taking the view that I do, that a tax on industry and thrift, speaking generally, is an undesirable one and therefore to be avoided, I conceive it to be my duty to support the measure, with the amendment which the Premier has promised. And on that principle I shall support the second reading of the Bill. It seems to me the Pre- mier should have gone further in subclause (2) of section 2, and placed these charitable-aid rates, water-rates, and other rates on the same level as the ordinary general rate. I can see no good reason for discriminating between them. A number of attempts have been made to lay down some general rule as to whether the rating on unimproved values system, if it be- comes law, will benefit the large owner or .the small owner. Now, I believe no such general rule can be laid down. If we are to discover what effect the Bill will have on any particular district we must look at the circumstances of that district, and we will find that what will be the result in one district will not be the result in another. The effect the system will have depends entirely on the relative values of the unimproved and the improved value in each particular district. I have taken out a few simple figures to illustrate what I have just said. Let us take, for example, districts containing property with a rateable value of $600,000, and the rate at present paid on the capital value is 1d. in the pound. That means an income of $2,500 for the local body. We will assume that the same sum is desired to be the income derived under the rating on the unimproved value. We will take two districts. The improved value in one of the two districts is, say, $400,000 : the unim- proved value, therefore, is $200,000-that is, the ratio of the improved to the unimproved value is as two to one. It necessarily follows that if that district were to obtain the same amount of revenue it must levy on the unimproved value three times what is levied on the 
<page:352>
worth $200, and is built on land worth $100, in that case the same sum in rates will be paid by the ratepayer under the unimproved value as under the old system-that is to say, a penny rate in the $300 capital value is the same as a threepenny rate on the $100 unimproved value. Now, assume, in the second of our districts, the improved value is €300,000, and the unimproved is the same sum-that is, that the two vaines are equal : in that case it is plain a twopenny rate on the unimproved value will realise the same income as a penny rate on the capital value. So that in the case of this district the man with the two-hundred-pound house on the one hundred pounds' worth of unim- proved land will pay two-thirds the amount he was paying under the old system. Again, take a man with a house worth $500 on land worth $100 : in the first district he would pay one- half what he did under the old system, and in the second district a third. Further, take a man with a house worth $800, built on land worth $800: in the first district he would pay half as much again as he did before ; in the second district he would pay exactly the same amount as he did before. Those three pro- perties afford fair samples of the usual class of holdings. As a final example, take the specu- lator who holds a large area of practically unim- proved land, waiting for the unearned increment. Suppose he holds a hundred acres of valuable land the improvements on which are worth $1,000, and the unimproved value of which is 9100 per acre-that is £10,000 : in the first  district he would be paying 130 for every £11 he paid before, and in the second district he would be paying $20 for every #11 he had paid before. These illustrations show at once that we cannot lay down any guiding rule to govern all districts as to what the effect of this Bill will be. We must look at the particular circum- stances of each district in order to discover what the effect will be therein. I said just now that if any honourable member had reason to vote against this Bill on the ground that it will affect his district prejudiciallv, that member is myself ; and I will give my chief reasons for say- ing so. In the Hutt portion of my electorate there is a large quantity of vacant land held for speculative purposes. It is very unfortunate that it should be so, and that it is so furnishes the principal reason why the Hutt district has been kept back. As to this land. the Bill would be all right if it levied the unim- proved-value tax, or the portion of it in excess of the old rates, on the owner of the property ; but unfortunately a large portion of this land is leased, and the tenants have to pay the rates. If this Bill passes, therefore, the lease- holders will have to pay increased rates to the extent of two or three times their pre- sent rates. That, of course, would be an in- justice to the leaseholders. But there is a still more awkward case in my district. The local bodies through whose districts the Manawatu Railway Company passes receive from that company a large sum-I believe, something Mr. Field pav a small fraction-say, about a sixth, or less -- of what it is paving at present in rates. That will be very unjust to the local bodies and other ratepavers, particularly as there are cases where loans have been raised for public works largely on the strength of rates the Manawatu Rail- way Company is paving ; and the result must be that the other se tlers will have to make up the amount by having their rates increased. There is another awkward feature from the Government point of view, and that is that the moment this Bill passes. the property of the Manawatu Railway Com- pany will be worth something like €1,500 a year more than it is at the present time ; and if the Government is going to buy it by private contract the company may ask -and why should they not ask ?- for an increase of price based on an annuity of #1,500 a year. From the Government point of view, it is a matter for their consideration whether, if they intend to buy this line by private contract, it will pay them to pass this Bill into law as it at present stands. With regard to the argument of the honourable member for Hawke's Bay, we younger members always listen to the honour- able gentleman with a large amount of interest and respect ; but it does seem to me that on this question the contention of the honourable gentleman as to the difficulty of fixing the un- improved value being an obstacle to this Bill coming into law was no argument at all. I am fully aware that in many instances it is very difficult indeed to fix on the unimproved value of land ; but that is no argument against the Bill, and if a competent valuer goes about his work properly most of the difficulties in the way of ascertaining the unimproved value will soon disappear. The honourable gentleman cited the case of a man who felled his bush, spent money in burning, grassing, and fencing the section, and after all the improvements were completed the land was worth less than it cost him to improve. That is a case I can well understand, and that result might easily happen even if the man might not have been extravagant in his expenditure. It is beyond doubt the case that the unimproved value of some of our back-woods country is a minus quantity-that is to say, that a man deserves to be paid for taking it up and improving it. and that for a period of years in some cases a man ought to be exempt from rates altogether on this class of property ; but, of course. as it becomes more accessible by the construction of roads and bridges, the increase of population, and other causes, the unimproved value will grow into something. But at the present time one can readily understand that there are cases where the unimproved value of the land is really a minus quantity. Then, the honour- able gentleman cited a case where the lands had been drained, where the drainage had be- Well, I come an exhausted improvement. think that a competent valuer ought not to have any difficulty at all in ascertaining the unimproved value under such circumstances. 
<page:353>
He must take into consideration the fact that that land was reduced from a swamp to a pasture, and he must allow something as im- provements for the drainage. And so on with respect to plantations of willows for river-pro- tection, and so forth. It seems to me that if the Government had incorporated in this Bill some directions to valuers as guiding lines for ascertaining the unimproved value it would have been a good thing to do; and if the services of the Valuer-General had been brought into requisition I am sure he could have drafted some guiding lines which would have simpli- fied and rendered uniform throughout the colony the work of the valuers in regard to ascertaining the unimproved value, and satisfy practically all needs. The honourable mem- ber for Hawke's Bay cannot credit that the present system works unfairly in the country districts. Now, I have a case in my own dis- trict, which is very like the following: In a remote part of the district, while the land is all in bush, a loan is raised in order to make a road or bridge. There are two principal owners who are being benefited by this work, and, as usual, a rate is imposed in order to provide the interest and sinking fund on this loan. The value placed upon the two properties is 10s. an acre-that is to say, the two landowners will begin by paying an equal amount by way of rates annually towards the sinking fund and interest on the loan. Later on, however, one man begins to improve his place, while the other does nothing in this direction at all. The result is that in a few years the one pro- perty is highly improved, and the other is in its original bush state. The former is valued at £6 an acre, and the latter still at 10s. ; so that, far from the one paying exactly the same amount per annum as the other, as at the outset, we find that the man who bas im- proved his property has to pay twelve times as much as his neighbour. But, for every €1 the one pays, the other only pays 1s. 8d. I would ask the honourable member for Hawke's Bay if that is a fair state of things. I do not wish to take up the time of the House in dis- cussing this question any longer, but before concluding I would like to mention the case of Brisbane. In reference to that, I can bear out the statement of the honourable member for Auckland City (Mr. Fowlds) that in the City of Brisbane a very noticeable feature is the absence of slums. At the time I was there, some six months ago, I did not know that the system of rating on unimproved value had been adopted. If one of the effects of the system is to abolish slums, I say let us have it, and the sooner the better. I should say, Sir, speaking generally, it is the small man who will be benefited by the passing of this measure, and it is the small man who in every case asks for it. In the speeches of honourable members it has been said over and over again that the increase would afford encouragement to men to build a better class of houses. The honourable member for Hawke's Bay compared the case of two bush settlers-the one who improved his place by building a good dwellinghouse, stables, sheds, VOL. CXVII -22. et cetera; and the other, his next-door neigh- bour, who simply carved his way into the bush, and was content to live in a hut. I say, Sir, if that man could not build anything better for his wife and family than a hut, then he was taking up something that was too big for him to handle. It was beyond his means, and that sort of settlement ought not to be encouraged. No better encouragement could be given to our colonists to improve their homes and their buildings generally than the passing of this measure into law, but with the provision that. the ratepayers of any district could at any time, by taking a poll, revert to the old system if they found it suited them better. Mr. McGUIRE (Hawera) .- I would like to say a few words before the question is put to the vote. I do not care for the Bill, because it is too drastic. It is also compulsory, and I do not like compulsion. I may here say, Sir, that I do not object to rating on unimproved value, which I believe is bound to come. We want first, however, uniformity in our system. Before we force this measure upon the people we should trust the people ; and before passing a Bill of this kind the Valuation Department requires to be reorganized. No department has, I think, caused so much dissatisfaction and irritation as that department. The valua- tions have not been on a fair basis ; they are not even, there are inequalities in every direc- tion ; and there is nothing more annoying than that feeling which arises from a sense of injustice, and to pass a Bill like this before we have mastered the first principles would, I think, be very hurtful, more especially as its provisions are compulsory. We have the Act of 1896, under which any local body can adopt rating on the unimproved value. Surely, Sir, that should be sufficient. Why force the people by a drastic measure like this, and at the same time pretend that we trust them? If we pass this Bill we will clearly demonstrate that we trust the people only when it suits us to do so. I am satisfied that this Bill is not required ; and if the compulsory clause is to be excised, as I understood the Premier to say it would be, then what object was there in introducing the Bill at all ? because we have sufficient legislation already on the statute-book in the Act of 1896. If the compulsory clause is to be retained, I can understand why the Bill has been intro- duced ; but I am strongly opposed to compul. sion, especially when there is no necessity for it. I believe that the great majority of the people are anxious to see valuations put on & fair and equitable basis. In the district I have the honour to represent the values are far too Because industries have high. And why ? sprung up, and the district is populated by a class of industrious settlers-men holding small areas of highly improved land. We are heavily rated because of the energy and perseverance of our settlers, who work early and late in order to bring their land into a high state of cultiva- tion. The improvements on the land, it is alleged by the settlers, are not sufficiently taken into account. In fact, the Land-tax Depart- ment, following the Land Assessment Act, takes - 
<page:354>
provements, and that I consider most unjust. What is wanted in our present system is equality of sacrifice-and anything that has the appear- ance of violating that principle is undesirable. The land should be valued irrespective of boom in any particular branch of business. Due consideration should be given to the cost of improvements. For example, large sums are borrowed under the Loans to Local Bodies Act, and are expended in the construction of roads and bridges, which add to the capital value of land ; but the increased value caused by the expenditure of these loans is not taken into account in fixing the unimproved value, but is added to the taxable value, notwithstanding that the loans to local bodies are a first mortgage on the land. Although £100,000 may be spent in a particular district, and the value of the land in that locality is raised £2 or $3 an acre, which brings more money to the Treasury, no consideration whatever is given for the money that is lent, and upon which interest has to be paid, and that seems to me to be very unjust. Now, I think I have given good reasons why we should hesitate before we pass an Act of this kind. The Land Assess- ment Act requires amending, and the Valua- tion Department requires to be thoroughly re- organized. Local bodies should be given power to appoint a valuer in each district in conjunc- tion with the Government valuer, and, when they have fixed a maximum and a minimum valuation in each district, the Government valuer could go to work, and between the two bases arrive at a fair valuation, with the result that irritation, dissatisfaction, and inequalities would disappear. But as it is at the present time the Government valuer is sent along, and in many instances the valuations made are most uneven. If a compulsory Bill like this is passed, what will be its effect on our Crown tenants? Honourable members must know that many of those people are not in a position to make improvements. The man who has standing bush that he has not the means to cut down will be taxed equally with those who are living in splendid mansions and have cattle grazing on land that is all cleared, fenced, and subdivided. Surely nothing can be more unjust than that. The Government are endeavouring to settle people on the land, and the settlers have in most cases many obstacles to surmount and hardships and difficulties to endure : but if we pass a Bill like this we shall add to their difficulties. I do not wish to go further into this subject, as I know the Premier is anxious to reply. All I can say is that I am against compulsion ; I have no objection to rating on the unimproved value should the people so desire, and I believe the time will come when that principle will be adopted throughout the country. In conclu- sion, I would ask the Government to amend the Land Assessment Act. Loans to local bodies should be classed as improvements, or deducted from the capital value, as other im- provements are, or treated as a first mortgage on the land. Legislation in the direction indi- Mr. McGuire have already stated, I am against compulsion, and for that reason I shall vote against the Bill. Mr. J. W. THOMSON (Clutha) .- I did not happen to be in the House at the time the member for Auckland City (Mr. Fowlds) com- menced his speech. When I came in he was addressing the House, and I was told that the honourable member had said that many years ago I voted in favour of rating on the unim- proved value of land, and that therefore he expected I would vote with him on this occa- sion. He referred to a division that took place so long ago as July, 1876-upwards of twenty- five years ago. Many things happen in twenty- five years. Just think of finding fault with a man for a vote he gave twenty-five years ago! There are very few men to whom the test could be applied. It is rather a severe test, for we all change our minds. I believe I could stand a test of this kind as well as any man in the House. I have no occasion to be ashamed of any vote I ever gave, and I think it will be found I have been exceedingly consistent. But in this particular case there is nothing in it at all. The honourable gentleman is entirely mis- taken. The Rating Bill was in Committee, and Mr. Seymour moved that certain words be struck out. Mr. FOWLDS .- That is not what I quoted ; it was an amendment by Mr. Button. Mr. J. W. THOMSON. - I am very doubt- ful whether the term "rating on unimproved value " had been invented at that time. I confess I did not know anything about it, and I do not think it was a subject of discussion at all twenty-five years ago. Mr. FOWLDS .- Read the motion moved by Mr. Button. If that is not rating on unim- proved value I do not know what is. Mr. J. W. THOMSON .- I shall look it up at my leisure. But I have no doubt I shall come out of that all right, as I have come out of many things ; and, as I have said, there are very few men to whom this test of consistency for twenty-five years could be applied. I find that, of the forty-one members who voted "Aye " on the occasion referred to, there is not a single member now in the House ; and, with regard to those who voted " No," the only two members now in the House are Captain Russell and my- self. This was several years before even the Premier was in the House. I find that Mr. Ballance voted, not in the way I did, but in the opposite direction-the way that the Govern- ment would be expected to vote now. I mention these things just to show that the test which the member for Auckland City wishes to apply to me is one that very few men can pass through unscathed. We all change our minds with time. The chief feature in the Liberal party is progress. I believe I have progressed just about as much as most men. I may say I have listened to this debate from beginning to end. It appears to me that all the arguments in favour of this Bill may be reduced to two. The one is that it would encourage people to put up buildings. I do not see that this is a 
<page:355>
very great thing to encourage. We may depend upon it that people will put up buildings just as there is a demand for them, and it is much better to trust to that principle than to put up buildings that may not be required. The second argument is that this Bill would tend to prevent speculation in land. People figure to themselves two properties, the one in- habited by a rich man, or a " fat man "-that is the classical term nowadays-and the other a poor man, or a " lean man," as he may be called. This "fat man," it is said, seeing beside him a small property on which there are no improvements, buys it and waits until it becomes valuable. This Bill, it is said, would prevent such a thing. But it appears to me that it will to some extent encourage speculation. One effect of this Bill will be to deteriorate the value of property. The poor man with a small unimproved property may not be able to pay the rates on it. His rich neighbour will buy it at a reduced price, and wait till it increases in value. Is not this speculation? It also ap- pears to me that this proposal is scarcely a fair one. Just let us walk through the City of Wellington in almost any direction, and we shall find very fine houses alongside very poor houses. These poor houses may have been put up in the early days; but they are quite sufficient for the people that they belong to, and I do not see that we should interfere with them. The effect of the Bill will be to make the "fat man " pay less and the "lean man " pay more. We hear a good deal about justice,  but it does not appear to me that there is much justice in that. And then there are the lessees of property. These lessees have almost invari- ably come under obligations to pay the rates. The rates may be so heavy that some tenants may not be able to pay them, but having as tenants come under obligations to pay rates as well as rents they will be forced to do so. I could go on and give other arguments, but as I rose specially to refer to the remark made upon me I shall say no more at present. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- Sir, I think, not- withstanding the protracted nature of the debate, that good will result therefrom. It has been to some extent educational, although I do not think that this was the opportunity for going into the question as to whether the rating on unimproved value was the correct method of raising local revenue. That has been decided by Parliament years ago. If the question before the House had been to repeal that law, with a view of introducing the old property-tax, or to insist that there should be only one system-namely, that of rating on the capital value-then I could have under- stood a good deal of what has been said in the speeches made by honourable members. But, Sir, right along the line-there have been but few exceptions - members, one after another, who oppose this Bill stand up in their places and say, " I am in favour of rating on the unim- proved value ; I believe it is the correct system of rating ; but I am opposed to this Bill." Then, I say, if they are sincere in their statement that they believe in rating on the unimproved value as the correct and proper way of raising local revenue, why do they oppose a Bill having for its object the carrying-out of that which they say they are in favour of ? To me, this position is unintelligible. Either they have not the strength of mind to carry out their own convic- tions, or they are afraid of the consequences. It is one of those two things. For my own part, time after time I have decided that whenever you endeavour to make progress you must risk unpopularity, and leave time to decide whether or not what you propose is for good. If you are satisfied that that which you propose will prove beneficial, you must not hesitate because of the immediate consequences. I ask, Sir, what answer can honourable mem- bers give who insist upon the general taxation being levied by means of a land-tax on unim- proved values ? And, in this House, I take it, if members vote as they have spoken-though we were somewhat evenly divided for a time- if an attempt were now made to bring back for general taxation purposes the property-tax, or the taxing of land on its capital value, there are not ten members who would vote for it. I cannot understand, therefore, the inconsis- tency of those members who stand upon the platform, and stand up in this House, and say they are in favour of general taxation being levied on the unimproved value of land, and then fear to adopt the same principle of raising rates for local purposes. It is to me incomprehensible. However, Sir, members have taken that view. I am astonished most, I may say, at the attitude of many honourable members in respect to this Bill. I say, then, there are some members who are glaringly inconsistent. I first come to the professed Radical member who represents Riccarton. I am sorry to see he is not here, and therefore probably I shall not say as much as I had other- wise intended. But it will be found, on refer- ence to Hansard for 1895, Volume 90, page 146, that the honourable gentleman spoke on the second reading, and notified his intention of voting therefor. I am alluding to the Rating Bill, maintaining the unimproved condition. In 1895, Volume 90, page 158, I find he voted for the second reading of that Bill. In Hansard for 1896, Volume 92, page 636-that is, the following year-he voted for the second reading of the Bill. In Hansard for 1896, Volume 93, page 139, he voted for the third reading of the Bill. In Hansard for 1900, Volume 112, page 454, he voted for Mr. Fowlds's amendment. Therefore, as I have said, when listening to the speech delivered by the honourable gentleman the other night, I was astonished to find that he was entirely opposed to rating on the unim- proved value. He gave, according to his lights, good and sufficient ground for the repeal alto- gether of such a law. Then, I want to know how it came about that, holding these views, he could have voted for the second and the third reading of those Bills which subsequently became law, and in those Bills was contained this very principle to which he now so strongly 1 objects. I say it is glaringly inconsistent. care not what measure was passed making 
<page:356>
it optional or mandatory. If there is a con- dition or a clause in the Bill, or a principle involved, which is contrary to the public weal and contrary to my conviction. I am in duty bound to oppose that measure, and do my best to prevent it becoming law. I therefore cannot understand the vote of the honourable member for Riccarton and others, and I cannot under- stand the vote of those who voted for the second and third reading of a Bill to give the power of rating on the unimproved value, and who to-day are afraid to pass the Bill now before us. And, to show a further inconsistency, 10.0. the honourable member for Riccarton voted for Mr. Fowlds's amendment ; and what was it ? "Mr. Fowlds ( Auckland City) moved the addition of the following new clause :- "Section twenty of ' The Rating on Unim- proved Value Act, 1896,' is hereby repealed." The member for Riccarton objects altogether to rating on unimproved value, he says, and vet he votes for this amendment which repealed section 20 of "The Rating on Unimproved Value Act, 1896," and which made every rate leviable by the local body subject to the optional pro- visions of the rating on unimproved value. I say I do not, in the whole of my parliamentary career, know of anything so glaringly incon- sistent. Then, Sir, I have always maintained this : that if taxation is to be fair there must be equality of sacrifice-the taxation should be put on the shoulders of those most able to bear it. I shall prove before I sit down-I will take any of the large cities of the colony you like, any of the country districts you like, and I will show you that in the rating on unimproved value you have equality of sacrifice, and you place the burdens on the shoulders of those most able   to bear them. But, Sir, what has kept the world back ; what is it that is keeping New Zealand to some extent behind now? It is the fear of the invisible. There are those persons who are ever hesitating, afraid to go forward, afraid to make a change, because they fear the consequences. I say there should be no fear at all in respect to this principle of rating on the unimproved value. I say that what has caused objection to this measure has been the fear of the single-tax, because there are gentlemen in this House who support this Bill, and they are also single-taxers. For that one reason many other members, and many people outside this House, fear the passing of this Bill. I cannot understand it. I am not a single-taxer. My belief of what is reasonable and not extreme prevents me going that length, and if the single-taxers in the House had opposed this Bill, I believe the larger number of those who have opposed it would have been found supporting the Bill. Honourable members doubtless are consistent, and consequently could not very well, I suppose, have refrained from expressing their opinions ; but, taking the debate right through, taking the arguments for and against, I say that the weight is in favour of rating on the unimproved value, although, as far as this Bill is concerned, it is only a mea- sure to make it general instead of optional. Then, we are told that the result of a poll Mr. Seddon at Auckland should cause members and the Premier to pause in respect to this measure. I am one of those men who believe in being progressive. Mr. Fowlds put forward a very proper suggestion : that where a poll had just been taken, and where under the existing law three years must elapse before the poll can be renewed, that that three years should elapse- that provision be made in the Bill that that time should elapse before they are brought under the operation of the measure. I think. myself, that that suggestion is a fair one. and. as far as I am concerned, I do not want to deprive the citizens of Auckland of the result of the poll for the time now allowed by law. There is not the slightest attempt being made to force it on them. But why should so much be made of the case of Auckland? There have been thirty-five or thirty-six polls taken in the colony on the same matter, and thirty-three of them have been in favour of rating on the unimproved value. The result in Auckland is that only one-sixth of the total number in the dis- triet have declared against rating on the unim- proved value. Why, then, should so much be said of this single case, as against thirty on the other side, and why should that one case be brought forward as a guide for Parliament ? It is ridiculous to suggest that it should be a guide. I consider that, bevond taking it as the opinion of the Auckland burgesses, we should take no further notice of the poll. But let there be, as there ought to be, the same vote-the vote of the people-on this question, as on other questions. in lieu of the vote of the interested parties, with the great power they wield - power which has not been for the good of the people in the cities ; let the vote be the vote of those who reside in the cities, and then we would see what the result of a poll in Auckland would be. I would have no fear of the result of a poll under such condi- tions. Mr. LAWRY .- You have not changed the franchise. Mr. SEDDON .- The franchise will be ex- tended-there will be the lodger franchise -- and there will be only one roll on which men will be returned to represent their fellow-men. That, I say, is coming, and the sooner it comes the better. Those who pay rents pay rates. Those who inhabit the houses are those who pay, and it is nonsense to say that only those who have an interest in property shall be represented. It is uneven : it is unequal ; it is wrong. Then, I am twitted with having de- parted from the principle of the Bill when I stated, in answer to the member for Franklin, that if the Bill were passed I would be pre- pared to make provision to allow those to come from under it who expressed a wish, by a majority of their number, to do so. I say there is no departure from the principle what- ever. Take the thirty-three local bodies that have adopted the principle, take the general feeling of the people throughout the colony. and I say that there you have the test ; and if you were to have a referendum on the question to-morrow the answer would be in favour of rating on the unimproved value. 
<page:357>
and make it general in its application, and then, if there are special circumstances, let them come from under that law. That is local option in the proper sense. Now, I will take one or two of the arguments that have been used. Here is one specious argument : that if the proposal is adopted a greater rent will have to be paid by the racecourses, by the "sports," and by the recreation trustees, and also by those who hold lands for recreation purposes. Sir, there is too much racecourse in this colony. There is too much sport in New Zealand. I say that one of the dangers which besets this young country is that there is too much sport, too much pleasure, and consequently many people are not looking to the reality of life : they are not, in my opinion, going on the right track, and there should not be encouragement given to that which exists at the present time. But there are private people who can afford to have sports grounds from which they are making huge pronts. If you can have racecourses within the boundary of a borough or city ; if you have, as I say, grounds of this kind-well, knowing the profit even that racing-clubs make -- knowing the profits made from these sports grounds An Hon. MEMBER .- What about the Canter- bury Trotting Club? Mr. SEDDON .- Why, the honourable mem- ber does not know what he is talking about. Discussing the matter with one of the vice- presidents of that club, and considering the amount spent upon the ground and the value of the improvements, and considering the in- creased value given to the land, I think it can very well afford to pay an increased rate. So that the honourable member was very unfor- tunate in referring to that. An Hon. MEMBER .- I referred to the Athletic Club. Mr. SEDDON .- I know athletic grounds belonging to private persons that are bringing in huge profits. The honourable member for Hawke's Bay trotted out the farmers in the back blocks. He said to rate them on this principle would be pernicious. They go back almost beyond civilisation, and they improve the land ; they go to the forest, they hew down the trees, they suffer great hardships ; and under this Bill, he said, they would be unjustly treated. Why, if you take one of these back- block settlers, every farmer on each of these sections is an improving farmer, and his thrift and energy will be exempted under this Bill. Therefore I say that the back-block settler -the thrifty and improving settler - will get relief. But I will give cases to the honourable member where men have taken up this timber country, and have never put an axe in it, and have allowed the timber to stand ; whilst the farmer who has improved his land has from year to year had to pay- say his land is worth $5 an acre-with his improvements he has had to pay upon £8 an acre. The man who has made no improve- ments and has allowed the timber to stand is the better off, because with the royalty on the is of greater value than that of the man who has effected the improvements. I would make the man who has left timber on the land and who has made no improvements pay the same rates as the improving farmer. Under the existing conditions of rating on the capital value, the timber has proved to be the best crop, with the royalty, and with the increased value given to the land by the labour and thrift of his neighbour ; and yet that neighbour is being penalised all the time, and the unim- proved-land owner comes in and sweeps up the full profits and all the benefits. I there- fore say that in this respect it is time there was an improvement and an alteration for the benefit of the back-block farmer. Then, we were told that the reason of this measure- the idea of increasing the graduated land-tax -came from Mr. Earnshaw. That was one of the arguments used by honourable members. What on earth Mr. Earnshaw's speech suggest- ing the increase of the graduated land-tax can possibly have to do with this measure I cannot for a moment imagine. All I can say is this : that if an increase in the graduated land-tax is required by the necessities of the country we should not hesitate; and I have never altered my views from the first passing of the Act- namely, that we were too moderate, and that with the increased population, and with the large spending that we are going in for weekly and yearly, I cannot understand how it has been allowed to stop as it is. But it looks to me that if concessions are going to be given in one way we must have something by which we can recoup ourselves in another direction, and I am very glad to find the matter noticed on this occasion, because it strengthens my views, and will prepare the way for what is coming, and that before long. Then, I call honourable members' attention to the Chinamen's gardens in the centres of the large cities of this colony. In Auckland and Wellington you will find Chinamen's gardens- An Hon. MEMBER. - Not in Auckland. Mr. SEDDON .-- Yes ; in Auckland, in one of the suburbs ; and if the fact does not point a moral to honourable members I do not know anything that will. I take it that the fact of a Chinaman being able to grow vegetables on land at a profit in the centre of the City of Wellington means that the owner of that land is probably getting at the rate, as I have been told, of £10 per acre per annum. It means that the owner is quietly lying back while the China- man is paying him a good interest on the money, and he is looking forward to the great profit he will get later on when he will cut up that land for building sections. But, in the meantime, the same remark applies to those shops and cottages of bygone days which you will find here in your City of Wellington, because in that re- spect I believe Wellington stands in the worst position of any city in this colony- Mr. HUTCHESON .- That is on the Church reserve that you are talking about. Mr. SEDDON .- I am not talking about a Church reserve. I am talking about what I

Before I do that, however, I will go to the country districts. A man with a hundred acres of land has improvements amounting to $300. He takes the land at $5 an acre. With $300 for improvements, he pays local rates upon £8 an acre ; while his neighbour, although the land has the same unimproved value of $5 an acre, has improvements amounting to only $100, and he pays upon £6, as against the other's £8.

The House adjourned at half-past ten o'clock p.m. LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. Wednesday, 14th August, 1901. Third Reading-Education Reserves-Invercargill Reserve Leasing Bill-Laud for Settlements Bill. The Hon. the SPEAKER took the chair at half past two o'clock. PRAYERS. THIRD READING. Woodville County Bill. EDUCATION RESERVES. On the motion of the Hon. Mr. T. KELLY, it was resolved, That this Council approves of 
<page:359>
for primary education, as specified in Paper No. 65, of 1901, being permanently set aside as endowments for primary education. INVERCARGILL RESERVE LEASING BILL. The Hon. Mr. FELDWICK, in moving the second reading of this Bill, said it had for its purpose the utilisation of a piece of land that was now lying absolutely useless. As would be seen from the preamble, the land had been vested in the Mayor, Councillors, and Burgesses of Invercargill by an Order in Council for the purposes of a public pound. How it came to be so vested was somewhat of a mystery, seeing that the borough already possessed a pound on a suitable site elsewhere, and this site was utterly useless for the purpose. It would be much better for the town if the land was utilised in the manner indicated. The Bill had gone through the Local Bills Committee, and every- thing connected with it was in order. The Hon. Mr. BOWEN would like the honourable gentleman to say in what way it was proposed to utilise this land. He knew there was a tendency on the part of munici- palities to lease lands for the sake of getting revenue out of them, although open spaces became more necessary as towns grew larger. His honourable friend had referred to this reserve as low, swampy land, and, if so, that was not the place for dwellinghouses. Of course, he himself knew nothing about it, but  he desired to know whether it was proposed that the land should be leased for dwelling- houses or for business purposes, or if it could be utilised as a public garden. A very beautiful garden might be made out of low swampy land by drainage. Of course, he was speaking in ignorance of the exact locality, but thought the honourable gentleman would see that it was advisable to let the Council know exactly what the circumstances were. He spoke with some little feeling, not about this case, but because he knew of so many cases in which open spaces provided in the early days as reserves for the benefit of a future population had been sacrificed. These spaces might now be of very great value for recreation purposes. It was to get information on these points that he raised the question. The Hon. Mr. FELDWICK, in reply, stated that as regards lungs the Town of Invercargill was more favourably situated than any other town in the colony. It had a park, and it had reserves, not merely a 2-chain street, such as there was in Christchurch, but a belt of re- serves, ranging from 5 to 7 chains in width, right round the town, and also through its centre. There was no need whatever for any more recreation-ground there, and if more were added they could not have justice done to them for a great many years, as it would be beyond the means of the borough to utilise them pro- perly. It was intended, as would be seen from the Bill, to add this particular piece of land to the endowment of the Town of Invercargill. There was no part of Invercargill that could not be rendered fit to build upon, and he had other parts of the town endowment, on " Glas- gow leases." The land was perfectly useless as it was-of no use either to the borough or the neighbourhood, and by no means could it become of any use to the Government. Bill read the second time. LAND FOR SETTLEMENTS BILL. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- Sir, in moving the committal of this Bill, I do not think I need say more than is needful to explain simply what has been done in the Select Committee. The Bill has not been altered in any shape or form as regards its intention ; but on the third page honourable gentlemen will notice that clause 8 now contains what was in the former reprint covered also by clause 9. The intention is exactly the same, though the wording has been altered so as to make perfectly plain what is intended ; and I think the Council will find that its intention is not only quite plain, but also the operation will be as specific as is de- sirable always in Bills of this kind. The object of this clause is to eliminate as far as possible the element of chance from dealings in these sections of estates which have been acquired for closer settlement. The element of chance, which now prevails to a very large extent, has been the cause of disappointment and delay to intending settlers, and it is desirable to take away that element from these dealings, because, unfortunately, the minds of many people are so affected by the fact of there being a mere element of chance in any matter that they come to regard it as if it were an ordinary lottery ; and in that way many persons go in for these transactions who perhaps are not pro. perly qualified. But the hardship to the bond fide settler - the hardship to the man who desires to get a home for himself and his family-is, that he is handicapped at the pre- sent time by the law as it operates, because there are, of course, differences between section and section, as some sections are more desir- able than others, and the larger number of names go down for the best sections, and there is undue competition for some of them. The proposal in this Bill to minimise the evil as far as possible, is that the sections of land should be grouped in classes, and that in the first instance no applicant shall put his name down for more than one section in that group of sections. But he can apply in more than one group if he likes ; so that the chances are really just as wide as they ought to be ; but instead of having to select his section the proposal now is that the applicant should select his group, and the subsequent balloting will decide which section he gets. I trust the Council will ap- prove of the proposals, and will consider that the Bill is a Bill which is to remove a real evil, and to place the settlement of the land on a more satisfactory basis than perhaps it has been under this principle in the past. As regards the amendment of the Bill in Committee, I do not consider there is any difference to which I need refer. It might appear that a change has taken place as regards clause 8. There is some differ- 
<page:360>
but I can assure the Council that the Committee has done no more than adopt the wording which will bring about the object desired. There is no important change in the clause, so far as I can see, since it went to the Committee. The Hon. Mr. BOWEN .- Do I understand that the honourable gentleman proposes to go on with the Bill in Committee ? The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- Yes. The Hon. Mr. BOWEN .- It has not been distributed yet, as reported on by the Waste Lands Committee. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- Oh, yes. The Hon. Mr. BOWEN .- When ? The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- Yesterday, I think. An Hon. MEMBER .- No, not until just now. The Hon. Mr. BOWEN .- Well, Sir, I dare say that a great many of the amendments in the Bill before us will be useful in the work- ing of the Act, but I cannot let this Bill pass, or, indeed, any Bill connected with land settle- ment, without expressing my regret that the Government have not seen fit, in an amending Bill, to remedy what I consider to be the real blot upon the whole of this land-settlement legislation. I am not now speaking of the policy of taking land for settlement compul- sorily. That is a matter upon which there may be differences of opinion. I have known my- self that any amount of land could have been secured by Government without any compul- sion whatever ; and it is evident that this is still the case, as the Government are now ask-  ing for power to purchase land by auction. But the blot on this legislation, which I think ab- solutely unjustifiable, is the power given to an individual Minister to take possession of any person's property. I remember when the origi- nal Land for Settlements Bill was before the Council, I said, on the part not only of myself but of many others, that we would agree to the Bill if a schedule of the properties that were to be taken was laid on the table of Parliament, and Parliament itself decided on the subject. Nodoubt Parliament has a right to take private property if such a course is proved to be neces- sary for the public welfare. But I say that a new principle-and one that is an absolute outrage upon all our ideas of right and wrong-was initiated in the original Bill, which puts the rights and properties of private citizens in a free country under the bidding and at the mercy of any individual Minister. I say that this is a wrong principle, and this power should not be given to any Government. I admit, as I said before, that Parliament has a right, for the benefit of the public, to interfere with any individual property if such a course is shown to be necessary. But Parliament alone has that right, and cannot constitu- tionally delegate it to any individual, whether Minister or official. There is plenty of land in the market, as the Government has found by experience. And no private owner should be coerced into giving up his property or his home unless the representatives of the people declare the necessity of such action. This is, to my mind, such a fundamental principle that Hon. Mr. W. C. Walker against an amending Bill on this subject being brought before Parliament without clauses repealing a provision which puts the property of individuals at the mercy of any man, whatever his judgment or ability may be. The Hon. Mr. JONES .- Sir, the honourable gentleman who has just sat down has made remarks in regard to this measure and the principles embodied in it which, of course, from his point of view are quite justified. But, Sir, this principle of taking land compulsorily has been in existence for several years, and I think that the great majority of the people of this colony will say the result has justified the means that have been used. The Hon. Mr. BOWEN .- The honourable gentleman must understand I am not now raising the question of the taking of land, but that it should be taken by Parliament, and not by the Minister. The Hon. Mr. JONES .- Well, Sir, that ob- jection has been answered in my expression of approval of the principles embodied in this measure: the result has been nothing but satisfactory. It has been se satisfactory, indeed, that from every part of the colony there is an outcry that more land should be taken. The Hon. Mr. BOWEN .- How many proper- ties have been taken ? The Hon. Mr. JONES .- I have not the record of the number before me, but I know that in the Waitaki district, in North Otago, and in South Canterbury a large number have been taken. An Hon. MEMBER .- Not compulsorily. The Hon. Mr. JONES. - No, not compul- sorily; but you want the compulsory principle in order to maintain your position, and help you to carry out this idea to perfection. Wherever a property has been taken by com- pulsion no hardship has occurred. I have never heard complaints from any landed pro- prietor that his land has been taken from him without his having been given fair remunera- tion. Sir, if the Minister, or the department, to which this duty of taking land has been intrusted does not do what is right, then, I take it, that Parliament can call either Minister or department to book for his or its action. That is quite sufficient. Those who are in- trusted with the duty of administering the Land for Settlements Act know what they are about. They know where the land is. They know what it is worth, or presumably they do, and they act accordingly, and if anybody, either a member of Parliament or a member of the general public, has any objection to what is done he can call those who are responsible to account for their action. Sir, this Bill pro- fesses to deal with what has been termed "dummyism," or what I would term "specu- lation," but I do not think the suggested amendment would have the desired effect. I am not prepared to say what would be effective, because I believe that where the mania for speculation exists it is almost impossible to meet it, whether it is in dealing with land or, in fact, anything else. The sugges- tion is, that the number of applicants shall 
<page:361>
that are available, and those who are left will then get a section each. But let us :suppose there are one hundred applicants for .some ten sections. The process of balloting down would not necessarily eliminate the speculators who desire to get sections in order that they might sell again at a profit, as has been done over and over again. The principle of balloting down might, indeed, have the effect of shutting out all the legitimate appli- cants, and leaving nobody but the speculators, who would, of course, get the land. There is only one expedient which I think might put a check on speculation in regard to these sections, and that is the steadfast refusal to allow any transfers. Unfortunately, my eyesight has been so bad recently that I have not been able to read, and I am therefore not so well posted up in the measure as I would like to be. An amended Amendment Bill is a thing one cannot understand when read to him; one must read it himself and compare notes. It seems to me, however, that it would be best to say that there shall be no transfers, and that if any settler desires to abandon his section it should go back to the Government and be dealt with afresh. I know it is hard to detect dummyism ; but if I had my way I would take care that the man who was detected in dummyism should be severely dealt with. He should be dealt with by imprisonment, without the option of a fine. That, I think, would put a stop to dummyism. But I have  no doubt that this measure is an honest attempt to get over difficulties which have been detected in the working of the land-settlement system in the past, and, as it seems to be the best possible suggestion we can get at the present moment, I shall give it my support. The Hon. Mr. SHRIMSKI .- Sir, my friend is wrong in the remarks he has made with regard to dummyism. Clause 10 says,- "Every applicant who obtains an allotment under this Act shall reside continuously there- on." And clause 11 says,- "It shall not be lawful for a lessee under this Act to transfer the land comprised in the lease within the period of five years from the date of such lease." I think that is quite enough protection. There will be no dummyism after those clauses are passed, because if a man has to pay five years' rent, and has to reside on his land and improve it, it is not easy to act as a dummy. Taking the Bill as a whole, I agree with the Hon. Mr. Bowen that it proposes to give the Minister rather too much power, and that it would have been better if the acquirement of these freeholds were laid before both Houses of Parliament before being carried into effect, so that members of both Houses might decide the matter. I think it is stretching the point too far to leave unlimited power in the hands of one individual. I must say I believe the present honourable gentleman who occupies the posi tion of Minister of Lands is thoroughly honest. I have known him for many years, and it is my belief that he would not do anything that was possible, however, that a person may have a feeling against an individual, and that he might exercise that feeling to the disadvantage of the person from whom he takes land. I therefore think that that power should not be given into the hands of one individual. The Hon. Mr. T. KELLY .- Sir, I cannot understand that a Minister of the Crown would have a vindictive feeling against any one who may apply for an allotment of land under the Land for Settlements Act. I think it is ridicu- lous to suppose that such might be the case. Any man who would be called on to fill such an honourable position would scorn such an act. When his judgment was called into operation he would act to the best of his ability in deal- ing with matters of this importance. I have looked carefully through this Bill-it was before the Waste Lands Committee-and I find that it deals with a most difficult subject. The policy of the land-laws with regard to taking land compulsorily has been settled for years back, and there is no occasion to go into that ques- tion now. The occasion for the Land for Settlements Act was, in the first instance, to supplement the Land Act of 1892. Under that Act, which dealt with Crown lands, there are any amount of provisions to deal with the settlement of the people on the land ; but it was soon found by those in authority that something was required in addition to that Act. In some districts, where there were no Crown lands, or where they were locked up, it was necessary, if possible, to buy land from private owners for the young people who were growing up, and who could not possibly get land in their own district. The intention of that Act was really to provide land for the landless. There is a great distinction be- tween this Act and the Land Act of 1892, but people generally do not carry in their minds the difference that exists between the two Acts. This Bill and the principal Act provides that land shall be purchased by the Land Commis- sioners. When it is purchased and cut up and offered for sale it passes over to the Waste Lands Board to administer, and they adminis- ter it under the provisions of the Act of 1892 and under the provisions of this Bill. It is difficult for any person who is not accustomed to these matters to fairly grasp the position. One must also read the Act of 1892 and the amending Act, and the regulations made by the Governor in Council. This amending Bill really does not alter the position very much. It is an attempt to give fair-play to all the parties concerned, and gives the Boards very large powers-unnecessarily large-the object being to give the landless an opportunity of getting land. A good settler, who is a holder of land, may apply for these lands, and another may apply who has no land at all. The Board, under this Bill, may decide that the man who has no land shall have the first chance, and I say that to do that fairly and well is a most difficult thing. Of course, when you once depart from the principle of selling land by public auction you get into all sorts of diffi- culties, and I myself know, as a member of 
<page:362>
resorted to to avoid the conditions imposed on the lessee, especially with regard to residence. Under the principal Act of 1900 the lessee may mortgage, sublet, or transfer his lease, with the consent of the Land Board and the Minister. This Bill limits still further the power of mort- gage. It eliminates the Land Board and leaves it almost entirely with the Minister, under It restricts the power of a certain conditions. lessee to transfer his lease unless he bas oc- cupied it for five years. I know this to be a desirable thing in the interests of the landless, because under it, if he mortgages and cannot pay his way, the land falls into the hands of the mortgagee. Taking the Act as a whole it is an improvement, and does not depart from the original principle nor make any radical change ; it only provides for those who are landless, and gives them a chance against those who have land now, but who may be successful in the ballot and thus cut out the landless applicant. The Hon. Mr. A. LEE SMITH. - In the few remarks I am going to make I shall confine myself to observations in respect to what the Hon. Mr. Bowen said in regard to compulsory purchase, and the taking of land by the Minis- ter alone. I should have thought if there was one thing more clear than anything else it is that once Parliament has decided it to be ne- cessary in the interests of the colony that land should be taken compulsorily, the purchase of any particular portion to be taken should be removed from the arena of Parliament. What would take place after the Board had re- commended the purchase of an estate? How long would it be before Parliament decided as to whether that estate should be taken or not ? The consequence would be that the people in the district, who might very likely have been looking forward to the opportunity of acquiring land, and the owner of the land who may have been considering with doubt as to how long he would have it in his hands, would suffer ; and the time which would no doubt be occu- pied in deciding whether the land should be taken or not would act very prejudicially on the interests of all concerned. But the honourable gentleman made some remarks as to this being, in his opinion, an iniquitous pro- ceeding-I do not remember whether those were his exact words, but that was what it amounted to. Let us look at Home: what is taking place in Ireland? Whenever I think about land legislation, I always carry my mind back to Ireland, because I have for many years taken every opportunity of reading all I could as to the position in that country. Some years ago an Act was brought forward for the voluntary purchase of land from landowners-that is, by mutual agreement between the owner and the tenant. What has been the result? You go into some districts and find an estate sold, and the tenants get it on the purchase-system, whereby a certain rental and a certain an- nual amount towards the gradual extinction of the purchase-price are paid annually ; whilst alongside it a tenant may be paying very much more in the shape of rent alone than the Hon. Mr. T. Kelly purchase-money towards the first cost of the land, simply because his landlord will not agree to sell. So much has this been noticed, and so much dissatisfaction has it given, that a gentleman named T. W. Russell, late a sub- ordinate member of the present Government, broke himself away from his Government connec- tion, seeing, as he thought, the wrongs that were being done to the small tenants in Ireland- broke away from the Unionist party, and started an agitation in Ireland on behalf of making the purchase of land compulsorily universal. And he has been supported not only by the Nation- alist party, which, as honourable members know, represents more than three-quarters of the whole parliamentary representation of Ire- land, but what is far more, with the exception of a very few members of the Unionist party of the representatives of Ireland, he has gained the adherence of members of Parliament, a large number of landowners and others, who agree that it would be best in the interests not only of the south and west of Ireland, but also of Ulster itself. The consequence is it is gaining hold not only of the people of Ireland, but of the Parlia- ment of Great Britain ; he is always gathering fresh recruits to his standard. If the honour- able gentleman had followed the matter as closely as I have he would see that within five or six years- The Hon. Mr. BOWEN .- I have reason to know a good deal about it. It is the question of how it is taken. The Hon. Mr. A. LEE SMITH .- I am quite sure that if purchase were left to voluntary agreement you would have the whole of Ireland gridironed with sections under voluntary and under compulsory sale, resulting in continuous dissatisfaction and friction between the two. There is only one principle : if Parliament has given its assent to the principle that you must have land for the people, and the people are waiting for it, you must deal with the matter in the way provided for in this Bill. It has been shown that every time a block has been thrown open there is a rush for it, and, as the honourable gentleman behind me stated, that has justified the principle. Granted that is so, you must place the working of the measure in the hands of an independent Board, so that the Minister can do nothing on his own initiative ; it has to be recommended by the Board as to whether the land should be taken and as to the price that should be given; the Minister is merely an agent, as the representative of the Government and of Parliament. If you do not in this way give opportunities to the constantly increasing number of young men in the country who require land, you will emasculate the Act and entirely destroy the advantages to be otherwise gained by the principle of compulsory purchase. The Hon. Colonel PITT .- The Hon. Mr. Bowen in his remarks did not find fault with the Bill under discussion, but he took advan- tage of the opportunity to reiterate an objec- tion which he says he had formerly made against the principle contained in the land for settlements policy. I think he is rather late to 
<page:363>
mitted success that policy has been throughout the colony. So far as compulsory taking of land is concerned, I suppose there are very few instances in the colony where land has been taken compulsorily. Possibly the Hatuma Es- tate may be mentioned as one ; and nobody doubts the principle the honourable gentleman maintained, that private estates and private rights must be subservient to the public good ; of course always being conceded that proper and reasonable compensation is paid for the private rights which are thus interfered with. Now the honourable gentleman contends that the proposed acquisition of private estates should be submitted to Parliament, and that it should decide the question, and not the Minister. Well that would lead to endless inconvenience. It has been pointed out by other honourable gentlemen that private rights are safeguarded by the Land Purchase Board ; the Minister acts only, or to a very great extent, on their recommendation; and the principal Act provides that, within twenty days of each session of Parliament opening, the Minister has to give an account of what has been done in reference to the purchase of land for settlement-a return has to be laid before Parliament. Now, the honourable gentleman altogether forgets, for the moment at all events, that this principle which he so much condemns is contained in other Acts of Par- liament, and is in operation in many ways. The same right for the Minister to take land  compulsorily is conferred under the Public Works Act; and lands have been taken upon many occasions for public purposes, and pri- vate rights interfered with in the same way as     they can be interfered with under this Bill, and the parties are sent to the properly constituted authorities to have their damages assessed ; and no one says, or can be heard to say, that that principle which has been sanctioned is any- thing but a proper one. Now, I fail to see any difference in that principle and in the principle laid down in the Land for Settlements Bill. The Hon. Mr. Jones says that one object of the Bill is to prevent dummyism, and that that is a reason why a man who acquires land under this Act is not to be allowed to dispose of it under a period of five years. Well, that may be a very proper and necessary provision for the purpose of preventing dummyism, but I am not alto- gether sure that it is a wise provision ; you may be protecting the system at the expense of the individual-at the expense of the selector. One can very well imagine a man taking up land under this Act who has not very much capital. He is perhaps able to take up the land and to stock it, but perhaps not able to build a house upon it. Well, this provision would prevent him borrowing any money, it would prevent him mortgaging in any way, and it is a matter for consideration whether that is a wise provision or not. That, perhaps, is a Committee objection, or, at any rate, a matter that probably should be considered in Committee. The Hon. the Minister, in reply, or in Committee, may tell us why the Govern- why a man should be prevented from borrow- ing a reasonable amount of money upon his property, for the purpose of enabling him to. develop it. That is the only matter I wish to call attention to in the Bill. As to the general principle of the Bill, of course, that has been settled by Parliament long since. This is merely a Bill to deal with difficulties which have arisen, I suppose, in the administration of the principal Act, and we can discuss this very well when we go into Committee. The Hon. Mr. JENNINGS .- Sir, it appears. to me that the principle of the compulsory taking of land has not been assailed by any one in the Council. As far as I gathered, the objection urged was that the whole power should not be left in the hands of one particular Minister. Now, there is some valid reason for that ob- jection, and it will, I think, be more apparent to honourable members who have read the report of the meeting of the Bank of New Zealand, which appeared in the New Zealand Times of Saturday last. From that report it will be seen that where too much power is given to one or two individuals to dispose of land, a loss may result. I will read what was said by Mr. Kennedy :- " Mr. Kennedy went on to mention estates in the South which were advertised for public sale. but which on the day before the day fixed for the sale were sold by the Board to the Govern- ment for a sum fully £20,000 less than the general manager had reason to believe he would have realised. The Board, consisting of the chairman, a representative of the bank, and the Premier, along with the Minister of Lands (the late Sir John Mckenzie) met, and the estates. were sold at their valuation, whereas the general manager declared that they would have realised $20,000 more if they had been allowed to go to auction. It was for this reason that he (Mr. Kennedy) said they must be patient and allow the management to deal with the estates he had referred to, and not press them to be wound up hastily." The Hon. Mr. LEE SMITH .- That is only the assertion of an individual. The Hon. Mr. JENNINGS .- It is the asser- tion of a gentleman whose opinion is of equal weight to that of the Hon. Mr. Lee Smith. But I read that extract simply to point out to honourable members that if you leave things in the hands of a few individuals, harm, or at any rate loss, may accrue. Now, with the general amendments of this Bill I am perfectly and strongly in accord. I have, during the past fifteen months, been living in a district where the earth-hunger has been very great, and I have heard, in connection with the balloting for lands, of great attempts to revive dummy- ism, of the stuffing of ballot-boxes by people who were rushing to get land that they had no idea of settling on at all, but were simply applying on the off-chance of being successful. and if so, they would sell almost immediately, and make a profit out of the transaction. That is not bona fide land-settlement ; and this Bill is going in the direction of stopping such prac- 
<page:364>
honourable gentlemen. An Hon. MEMBER .- This Bill does not deal with that at all. The Hon. Mr. JENNINGS .- I beg pardon, what does clause 8 mean ? Does it not deal with the applications, and balloting for land ? The whole of the subclauses also deal with the mode of procedure when there are more than one applicant for allotments suitable for farm- ing purposes. Let the honourable member read carefully clause 8, and particularly sub- clause (5). An Hon. MEMBER .- This deals with land for settlements. The Hon. Mr. JENNINGS .- I can draw the distinction between the two as well as the honour- able member. It appears to me that too much power is given to the Board under subsection (4) of clause 8: "The Board shall make in- quiry, as provided by the principal Act, as to each applicant's bona fides and suitability." The Hon. Mr. Kelly has stated that the Land Board would make inquiries as to whether an applicant had land or not. If the person who put in the application was found by the Board to have land, they probably would give it to the landless applicant. Now, that seems all very well, and very nice; but I ask my honourable friend, who is a farmer, how many instances could he relate of the failure of many who were put on the various settlements, and who were totally unacquainted with the working of land, or the care that should be given to stock. My contention is that it is better to let those people get the land who can utilise it and work it to the best advantage, than to give it to people who will make failures in their attempts at settlement. I know of a great number of instances of failure, which re- sulted from putting people on land who were ignorant of agricultural work. The amend- ments in the Bill are in the direction of making the land for settlements policy that has been adopted by Parliament more effective, and to tend more to bona fide settlement than hereto- fore, and therefore I approve of them. The Hon. Mr. TWOMEY .- Sir, the Bill was only circulated just when I sat down here, and consequently I have not studied it very closely, nor have I been able to compare it with the principal Act ; but there is one thing I wish to say, and it is this : that I think the discussion this afternoon is extremely satisfactory. After all that has been said about this question of land for settlements, all the objections are narrowed down to one small one now, and that is, whether the schedule of the land taken by compulsion shall be submitted to Parlia- ment, or whether the land shall continue to be taken under the present system. Now, I think that, after all has been said concerning land-settlement, it is extremely satisfactory that the question is now narrowed down to that one point ; and, for my part, I think that this objection might as well be thrown overboard with the rest, so that we should all accept unanimously the fact that this land-for- settlements scheme is proving extremely bene- Hon. Mr. Jennings the system of submitting to Parliament a sche- dule of the lands to be taken, what would be the result ? Honourable gentlemen have heard that too many cooks spoil the broth, and that is exactly what would happen if you had these schedules submitted year after year to Parliament. It would be a sort of referendum with which you would never do any good at all, and never get any land for settlements at all. It is not necessary to discuss the compulsory phase of the question now, for even the Hon. Mr. Bowen admits that it is correct ; conse- quently it is not necessary to point out why it was expedient to adopt it. I will simply say, before the compulsory clauses were put in the Land Act land could not be bought for these settlement purposes. The Minister found that there must be a compulsory power placed in his hands. And here now the honourable gentle- man makes a great virtue of the fact that very few estates have been taken by compulsion. But what does it mean ? It means this : that this power which the Minister has had has been used very sparingly and with the greatest caution. That is the meaning of it. And seeing this, where is the reason for being afraid ? This taking by compulsion is only an administrative act; and is every administra- tive act to be first submitted to Parliament before the Minister can act ? I do not like to use any harsh words by which to characterize such a suggestion. Some honourable gentle- man said that the present Minister is to be trusted because he is honest. That is not the question at all. You should not consider the honesty or dishonesty of a Minister. That is not the question. Although you have an honest Minister to-day, such a thing as a dishonest Minister may crop up to-morrow. Consequently, we must not rely on the honesty of Ministers individually or collectively. What we want to know is: Are our laws such that dishonest men cannot do dishonest things ? Is our law honest ? I say our law is honest, and I say our law is such that it is impossible for any Minister, no matter how dishonest he may be, to do a dishonest thing under the Land for Settlements law. In the first place, when the negotiations come on, there is the Land Purchase Board. If they fail in their negotiations, then the case comes publicly before the Court, and then it is handed over for administrative purposes to the Waste Lands Board. Then it is disposed of by means of the ballot, and, under the circumstances, how can a Minister or any man living use a system like that for favouritism ? It is impossible. The law has been made so that every man must be honest under it, and consequently there is no necessity at all to raise this question of sub- mitting the schedules of lands to be purchased to Parliament. The Hon. Mr. BOWEN. - It is not the question of valuation ; this is the question of the necessity of taking. The Hon. Mr. TWOMEY .- The very idea I have dealt with. It is not necessary to go over the same ground again. As I said before, 
<page:365>
that objection may as well go overboard with the rest. It is narrowed down to that; and it is acknowledged that the system is right. That is all I got up to say ; just because I felt so satisfied with the tribute that has been paid to the system, and paid even by those who were opposed to the lands-for-settlement system, I thought it was desirable to accentuate it, so that we could feel confident that the system is right. The Hon. Mr. BOLT .- Sir, perhaps it is just as well that we should be asked to turn our atten- tion from this Bill, which merely deals with details, to the general principle which underlies this question of the purchasing of private es- tates. It is some time ago, as honourable mem- bers are aware, since this principle was embodied in an Act, and I think it will be wise for us, see- ing that this question has been raised, to con- sider under what circumstances it was intro- duced, and what were the evils that were supposed to be remedied by it. Every one will remember that at the time it was introduced it had been found that enormous tracts in this country had been purchased by, or had entered into the possession of, a very few men, and that it was practically impossible to bring these lands into the hands of the cultivator, as they were being held for speculative purposes, and it was found that the interests of the colony generally were suffering from this want of land for the cultivating of classes. What was done ? The Land for Settlements Act was passed, and under the Act the Minister was empowered under certain circumstances to purchase es-  tates for public purposes. Now, Sir, we all know what has been the result. The result has been that large tracts of this land have been brought under cultivation, and the settlement   of the country has progressed immensely. What would have been the case providing that on every occasion when it was found necessary to purchase land for settlement the proposals had to be submitted to Parliament in order that it should fight over the question ? I would ask honourable members to think whether we would have settled our people on the land, providing that on every occasion the question was intro duced to Parliament, and a special Act had to be passed to decide whether this particular estate or the other should be purchased and brought into cultivation. I venture to say that the principle of always appealing to Parliament has been the impediment to truly beneficial legislation in all past ages, and it would have been the same in this case. We should simply have people's minds diverted from the main issue, and we should be involved in a parlia- mentary squabble over this question on every oc- casion it was deemed desirable to purchase land. I do not think the benefit which has accrued to the colony would have been attained under such circumstances. The exceptionally proper and judicious way in which the Act has been administered should have prevented any dis- cussion of this fundamental principle being raised now. No kind of complaint can lie against the principle underlying the Act, or its administration. Those from whom lands have been taken have been well compensated. I am not sure if in some cases they have not got too much, and possibly that is the worst that can be said against the measure. So far as the statement made by Mr. Martin Kennedy at the meeting of the bank is concerned, I can only regret that he was in the position on that bank-not that I have any ill-will towards him -- to make any such statement. I regret that any one should be in a position connected with that bank outside the State ; and if the State had had that bank, and cleared off the shareholders and disposed of the estates, I think it would have been an infinitely better thing for the colony. I hope that will be done at no distant time. I can hardly imagine how any one could have, I may say, the assurance to raise a question as to the beneficial effects of the Land for Settlements Act. I say those benefits would have been curtailed immensely-indeed, the provisions of the Act would have been almost nugatory-if it had not been put into the power of the Minis- ter to deal with land in the way he has done. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- Sir, I do not think I need to say much in reply. Cer- tainly, one gentleman questioned the policy of the principal Act, but every speaker who suc- ceeded him, with perhaps one exception, has emphasized the fact that the policy of the prin- cipal Act has been a complete success, and that no one has any right to throw any doubts on the bona fides of its administration. At all events, I can assure the Council that it is quite a delu- sion to suppose that Parliament is not supreme in the matter now. Of course, when " Minis- ter " is used in the Act it means in a collective sense, and that a Minister does not take these steps without consulting his colleagues in the Cabinet ; and if any mistakes have been made in the past, or are made in the future, Parliament is perfectly well able to express its opinion in a very emphatic manner. The whole procedure has been carefully calculated. So many steps have to be taken that it is quite impossible for even the most arbitrary --. I will not say dis- honest, because I do not think the term applies -- Minister to make mistakes, because there are so many checks-and so many periods allowed for reconsideration-that it is almost impossible for mistakes or errors or omissions to occur. I am pleased indeed to find that this is the only fault to be found in a policy which, when it was first introduced, was bitterly attacked. The Bill is to improve the machinery of the present Act. It introduces no new principle, but simply en- deavours to improve the machinery and make it still more satisfactory in its intention to place bona fide settlers on the land. As to the power of the settler to get advances on his land. I think the position is not altered from the way in which we find it at the present time. The Minister may permit such advances to be made, as they are made now, so far as the improve- ments go. Sir, I beg to move, That you do now leave the chair. Bill committed, and reported with amend- ments. The Council adjourned at five minutes past four o'clock p.m.

On the motion of Mr. MASSEY (Franklin), it was ordered, That there be laid before this House a return showing the names of the persons or firms who received the orders for the 50,000 tons of oats referred to by the Premier when re- plying to a deputation on the 7th instant, the dates on which the orders were received, and the prices per bushel (either f.o.b. or c.i.f.) at which such orders were placed. TIMARU HARBOUR BOARD DISTRICT AND HARBOUR BOARD BILL. On the question that leave be given to in- troduce this Bill, Major STEWARD (Waitaki) said he did not rise for the purpose of asking the House to refuse leave to introduce this Bill, but to present a petition against the passing of the Bill, which he should presently move that it be referred to the Local Bills Committee, which would have to deal with the Bill. The petition was from the Mayor and Councillors and 806 other burgesses and residents of Waimate and the immediate neighbourhood, praying the House not to pass a Bill to include the Borough of Waimate in the Timaru Harbour Board Rating District. He moved that the petition be read. Motion agreed to, and petition read by the CLERK. Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister of Marine) said he could not compliment the honourable gentle- man upon the course he had taken that after- noon. As an old member of the House, and as one who had occupied the position of Speaker, he ought to know that the proper course was to allow honourable members an opportunity of perusing the Bill. The present position was that there was no Bill before the House, and the honourable member should have known that the proper time to present a petition was on the motion for the second reading of the Bill, when the honourable gentleman would have just the same oppor- tunity as he had that afternoon. The reading of the petition had taken a considerable time, of the House had listened to the reading of it. Those who had listened would have gathered that there was an intention to force part of the district the honourable member represents into the Timaru Harbour District. That was not so ; and honourable members when they saw the Bill would see what its actual purport was. On the present occasion he only wished to say this : that the petition as read bristled with gross and misleading inaccuracies. He would further refer to this when dealing with the Bill itself ; and he hoped the honourable member, when he received, as he understood the honourable member would receive, a petition from his own constituents in favour of this Bill, would take the same course in having that petition read as he had taken on the present occasion. Leave given to introduce the Bill. On the question, "That the Bill be now read a first time," Major STEWARD (Waitaki) wished to say two or three words in reply to the honourable member who introduced the Bill. The honour- able gentleman had accused him of taking an improper course, and said that, as an ex- Speaker of this House, he should have known the proper time to present a petition was on the second reading of a Bill. Now, he was aware, as an old member of the House, that the proper time, if one wanted a petition to go before the Local Bills Committee, was to pre- sent it at the time of the first reading, because the Local Bills Committee's report would have come down before the second reading ; and it would be something like locking the stable door after the steed was stolen if he presented the petition without having it referred to the Local Bills Committee. Now, with regard to the statement of the honourable member that the allegations in the petition were not correct, all he had to say was that these allegations were put forward on the testimony of his Worship the Mayor, the Councillors, and all the leading citizens of Waimate, and he left the matter there. He believed there would be witnesses from Waimate who would be pre- pared to substantiate the allegations of the petition before the Local Bills Committee, and it was for the reason that he wished them to have an opportunity of being heard, as he was sure the House did, that he had taken this course with the petition. The honourable member said he would have a petition to pre- sent in favour of the Bill. He had no such petition at present. He had heard that by a majority -- he thought of two-the Waimate County Council had passed a resolution in favour of the Timaru Bill; but the County Council did not represent the burgesses of Waimate, who were the persons interested. Further, it would be seen, if any petition in favour of the Bill did come up, that he would move that it be received, and also that it be referred to the same Committee. It would be seen that the weight of the petition for the Bill was very little as against the weight of the peti- tion against it. He would not for a moment attempt to refuse any honourable member, or 
<page:367>
ber, the courtesy of leave to introduce a Bill. He therefore did not oppose the introduction of the Bill at all; but when it came down from the Local Bills Committee it would be his duty as member for the district to do his very utmost to persuade the House not to pass it into law. Mr. HALL-JONES said he had informed the honourable member that he would not press the Bill before the Local Bills Committee until the honourable member had an opportunity of producing any witnesses he desired to bring before that Committee. Witnesses could pro- duce evidence regarding any statements made in the petition, and for that reason there was no necessity for the petition itself being referred to the Local Bills Committee. The honourable member said the statements contained in the petition had been drafted on the authority of the Mayor of Waimate, and, if that was so, all he could say was that he was sorry for the Mayor. Bill read a first time. BIRTH REGISTRATIONS. Mr. GUINNESS (Grey) asked the Colo- nial Secretary, Whether the Government will this session bring in a Bill to amend the law so that parents may register the births of those children whose registration has not been effected within the statutory period through neglect or inadvertence ? This question was one that was periodically brought under the notice of the Government. Through inadvert-  ence or forgetfulness, or not knowing the law, persons were in the habit of neglecting to register their children within the time required. In 1882, and again in 1892, amending Acts were passed allowing persons, by giving special proof of the date of birth and by paying a special fee for that purpose, to come in and register their children. He hoped the Government would see their way now to pass this short measure giving relief in the manner indicated in his question. Sir J. G. WARD (Colonial Secretary) said there was a good deal of force in what the honourable gentleman represented, and as from time to time we were in the habit of introducing a short Bill, so as to give an opportunity to those who desired to register in the way the honourable gentleman indicated, to do so- usually every ten years - it appeared to him desirable to again amend the Act in that direc- tion. He would go into the matter to see what could be done. AUCKLAND GOVERNMENT ARCH. Mr. PALMER (Ohinemuri) asked the Go- Vernment, As the Government arch in Queen Street, Auckland, not only impedes the traffic, but has become very unsightly since all the paint has been washed off, will they take immediate steps to have it re- moved ? He would point out that if there was any expense incurred in removing this arch it would have to be paid later on if not now. The arch was very unsightly now that the paint had been washed off, although its removal was as that it was really blocking the traffic. Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) said that when recently in Auckland he was asked that this arch should be given to one of the local bodies, so that it might be removed and erected at some other spot. He had no ob- jection to that course being followed ; but he understood there was a difficulty in the arch being removed as a whole, and that it would have been necessary to have taken it to pieces before it could have been removed. That the local body could not see their way to do. In- structions had, however, now been given to have the arch removed. UNIFORM SET OF SCHOOL-BOOKS. Mr. MONK (Waitemata) asked the Minister of Education, If he will cause instructions to be issued to the Boards of Education throughout the colony to introduce one uniform set of books, such instructions to take effect on and He had been after the 31st March next ? requested to ask this question by those inter- ested in education matters and who were asso- ciated with the administration of regulations. At present, if a family removed from one educa- tion district to another, it was often necessary for the parents to purchase a new set of school- books, because those used in the previous school were not in use in the new district to which they had removed. This was felt to inflict needless cost and to be oppressive. Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) said that some time ago in the House the Government were charged with trying to supersede the functions of the Education Boards, and if they were to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member it would lend colour to that. He might say that nothing the Govern. ment had done had been done with a view of taking away the work of the Education Boards. The honourable member was well acquainted with educational matters and with education opinion, and, for the purpose of placing on record, he would read a circular issued by the Minister of Education on the 4th July, 1899, concerning this very matter :- " Education Department, Wellington, 4th July, 1899. "Circular to Education Boards. "The question of uniformity of school-books has been brought under the attention of the Minister of Education. "The Minister deems it unlikely that the want of uniformity in school-books would often create serious inconvenience through removal of children from one education district to another ; on the other hand, he thinks that hardship might frequently be caused thereby through the removal of pupils from one school to another within the same education district ; and he wishes to point out that this matter would be set right if every Education Board would see that the chief books, especially the Readers, were the same in all schools under its jurisdiction. " Under the regulations just issued the num- ber of series of Readers authorised has been 
<page:368>
siders that there is still ample choice to enable Boards to suit the wants of their respective districts ; and he desires me to call the atten- tion of the Boards to the obligation imposed by the regulations, of confining their choice of books to those contained in the list of authorised school-books. "] might suggest that the hardship that sometimes ensues when pupils are moved from one education district to another would largely disappear if Boards would adopt some such plan as that of buying from pupils second-hand . books in good condition, the books so bought being either sold again or kept to be used as supplementary Readers when the Readers in use were changed. " GEORGE HOGBEN, Secretary for Education." That had drawn the attention of Education Boards to this matter, and he thought they might rely upon the Boards, who were so well and ably represented in the House, to do some- thing. Members might bring it under the notice of Boards, and arrange for one common form of school-book throughout the colony. He would much rather see that course adopted, and would suggest to members of Boards in the House that it might be brought up at any conference, so that we might have uniformity. # MAKOHINE VIADUCT. Mr. LAWRY (Parnell) asked the Minister for Public Works,-(1) Who recommended the construction of the Makohine Viaduct : (2) what Government was in power when the recom- mendation was acceded to : and (3) if subse- quent investigations have not proved that the costly work of the construction of the said viaduct could have been obviated ? He was not in the House at the time the construction of this viaduct was authorised, and his object in asking the question was to bring before the notice of the Minister for Public Works whether it would not be desirable to abandon at the present time the construction of this costly work and put in a concrete culvert to carry the water, which was not of great magnitude, and thus do away with the great danger of crossing this viaduct. His impression, from a knowledge of the country and what he had been told by experts, was that in the end it would be much more economical to abandon the construction of the viaduct, and carry on the work in the direction he had indicated. As to whether there was any object, or whether it would be any advantage to find out who was responsible for the construction of this white elephant, that was a matter at the present time of no great importance. Mr. HALL- JONES (Minister for Public Works) said it was unfortunate for the House that the honourable member came into Par- liament the year after the decision was arrived at to erect this viaduct. After a number of trial lines had been run to find out which was the most suitable, a final decision was arrived at in December, 1886, to carry the line by the Mr. Hail-Jones time was Mr. Blackett. The decision was recon- sidered in November, 1890, but no departure was made from the decision arrived at in 1886. He thought it was the Stout-Vogel Government who were in office in 1886, and the Atkinson Government were in office when the matter was again brought under review in 1890, when it was decided to adhere to the decision of 1886. As he had said, a number of trial lines. had been run, and this was found to be the most suitable. Various engineers had reported on the different routes, and there had been a suggestion made to lay the line lower down the terrace, which would not have required so high or so long a viaduct : but it would have meant very expensive works, and would have led to awkward grades ; and this proposal was condemned by Mr. Blackett, and also by the engineer who surveyed that part of the work. There had since been a question raised to sub- stitute an embankment for the viaduct, but at that time all the cuttings had been completed, and it would have required all the material to be excavated for making the embankment. No doubt large quantities of material in the first instance could have been supplied from the large cuttings. He might say that expert en- gineers said the material was of such a peculiar nature that the bank would not stand-that it was soft, and would run. The member for Rangitikei knew something about the formation there, and no doubt has a good idea of what might happen. His own idea was that there might be some means of keeping it from slip- ping : but at that time the work was too far advanced. With an embankment it was a difficult matter to provide for the drainage of the area embraced by the country in the Mako- hine Valley. It comprised some thirty - six square miles of country, which had to be pro- vided for. and even though culverts were made they would be very expensive in construction. Honourable members could understand that an embankment such as was suggested by the honourable member, 240 ft. high, would require an enormous base, and, as the tunnel would have to be a long one, the work would be very costly. There was no question that to now make an embankment of a deviation would be unwise. He was sorry the House in 1886 had not the honourable member's experience as an engineer. EDUCATION BOARDS ELECTIONS. Mr. FOWLDS ( Auckland City) asked the Go- vernment, If they propose to take any steps this session to provide for the secrecy of the ballot at Board of Education elections? It seemed to him that in these elections there was just as much reason for secrecy of the ballot being maintained as in any other. It was not an in- frequent occurrence that defeated candidates were found tackling members of School Com- mittces a day or two after the election as to why they did not vote in a certain direction. After the recent Board of Education election, a conference of School Committees was held in the Auckland District, and unanimously passed a 
<page:369>
resolution in favour of something being done in this direction. Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister for Public Works) said a similar question had appeared on the Order Paper the previous day under the name of the honourable member for Waihemo. This was the first he had heard of an objection being raised by those interested as to the method of voting. It must be borne in mind that this was the first election held under the new Act, and it seemed to him it would be better to give the present system a fair trial before making any alteration. Under the old system, where members voted as a committee, there was no secrecy. It could then be ascer- tained who any member of a School Committee voted for, and the new Act was drafted on the same lines. He did not think members of School Committees would be likely to be in- fluenced by any person outside as to the vote they should give. If there was any feeling against the present system, the better course would be for the School Committees to send any resolution passed on the subject to the department. It could then be ascertained what was the general desire, and whether a change was desirable. BISHOP'S RESERVE AND OTHER NATIVE LANDS, MASTERTON. Mr. HOGG (Masterton) asked the Govern- ment, Whether they propose to take any steps to have the Bishop's Reserve at Masterton, and  the other Native lands in the Masterton elec- torate, administered and properly settled in the interests of both Natives and Europeans ? There were several blocks of Native land in his district     that were producing nothing to the owners. The block known as the Bishop's Reserve was of com- paratively small area, but it could be turned to useful account if taken over by the Government. It was almost alongside the Masterton Railway- station, and would be most suitable for work- men's homes or residence-sites. The revenues that for years had been derived from that re- serve, instead of going to the Native owners, had gone into the hands of the Church. He did not suppose any Church was capable of obtaining money by false pretences, but while this reserve was originally intended to provide for a Native college, the revenue from it, which now amounted to some thousands of pounds, had never been devoted to that purpose. Lately, however, it appears that it has been decided by the Supreme Court that the money could now be devoted to the purposes of a college or school, and, consequently, he wished to know whether any steps could be taken to turn the land to the best advantage both for Europeans and the Natives. There was a couple of other blocks-one, of about a thousand acres, near the Village of Hastwell, and the other, containing about four thousand acres, at Hamua, near Eketahuna. The land was well adapted for dairy farms. Sawmillers had been through both blocks, and the Native owners were anxious that the lands should be administered in such a way as to return them some revenue. The reserves were surrounded by creameries ; VOL. CXVII .- 23. and, as the sons and daughters of the farmers in the district were growing up, he would like to see these lands made of some service to the community. Mr. CARROLL (Native Minister) said the Bishop's Reserve to which the honourable'gentle- man referred was, unfortunately, in such a posi- tion that it was outside the control of the Government. It was true the title was the same as that of the Porirua Reserve, which had been the subject recently of Supreme Court proceedings; but it was not affected by the judgment in that particular case, because it was not joined in the action. He agreed that it was undesirable that these reserves should be allowed to lie in an unproductive state, and if they could be devoted to the purposes of settle- ment, well and good. If the revenue could be increased in some way so as to enable the owners to get the benefit of it, and have it applied to the purpose originally intended, he thought the interests of the Natives would be amply served. However, this was a large question. The reserves could not be dealt with individually, but as a whole. He was inclined to the opinion that the State should have control of all these old education endowments which had been vested in mission societies, so that practical effect could be given in the direction intended by those who gave those lands under the trusts so declared. What the Government desired was to see the best use made of these reserves in the interests of the beneficiaries and the public good. As tothe lands mentioned by the honour- able gentleman as lying waste, that might be the case in a few special instances, but not generally; the honourable gentleman must bear in mind that these lands he referred to were set apart for the use and occupation of the Native owners, and, though they may not be using those lands at the present time as they should do, they should still hope for the opportunity of inducing them to take up land for settlement side by side with Europeans. If they were to dispose of all their reserve lands for the purpose of European settlement, where would they be when the time came round when they wanted to go on to their reserves to farm and otherwise settle ? Why, we would have no land to give them. In this matter the best thing to do would be to get all the facts in reference to those reserves gathered together, and ascertain the wishes of the owners. If they had sufficient land at present for their use and maintenance, and there were areas lying waste, then such areas should be given over for settlement by Euro- peans. STOATS AND WEASELS IN THE NORTH. Mr. MONK (Waitemata) asked the Govern- ment, If. on account of the rapid increase of stoats and weasels in the North of Auckland, they will put a sum on the estimates to subsi- dise the efforts of the settlers for their destruc- tion ? He had been requested by an important agricultural association in the North to put the question. The manner in which those vermin were taking possession of the country was be- 
<page:370>
from his own personal knowledge. He was sur- prised at the number of districts in which these animals were becoming numerous. He had received complaints from the owners of home- steads at the inroads they were making. The request made by the association was that he should ask the Minister to put a sum on the estimates to assist the settlers in extermi- nating these pests. The soil in the North of Auckland was too hard for rabbits to burrow in, and they were, consequently, not troubled with them to any very great extent. There certainly were rabbits there, but they were not in such numbers, excepting in a few localities, as to necessitate assistance from stoats and weasels being given to exterminate them, as in other parts of the colony. Owing to the increase of stoats and weasels it was be- coming difficult to keep fowls, and even young lambs. Some time ago he had a note from a gentleman, who did not live near the place were the present complaint came from, stating that they were actually attack- ing the young sheep. It seemed to him that there was very good reason for the Govern- ment taking the matter in hand. He was afraid that this pest would become one of the most difficult to keep under, because there was so much cover in the forests and broken country in the North. It was not like the South, where they were to be found in moun- tainous districts. Unless something was done it would become next to impossible to keep fowls and small animals, unless they were surrounded by wire fences and were kept in rat-proof enclosures. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister for Agriculture) said he had not had one single letter of complaint from the North of Auckland about stoats and weasels. Mr. MONK said he could give the Minister the letter referred to. Mr. DUNCAN said it would be the first that he had had from that quarter on this subject. He was not aware that the Government had ever put stoats and weasels in that part of the country. Mr. MONK .- But the Government had in- troduced them here, and they had found their way to the North. Mr. DUNCAN did not see how they could very well run from the South Island to the North Cape. Mr. MONK had come across them seventy miles north of Auckland. Mr. DUNCAN was of opinion that they had been carried there in people's pockets. He was not sure that stoats and weasels would do the damage that was feared. For the past seven years they had been close to his fowl-yard, and he had not had one of his poultry interfered with. Nobody was complaining about them. Ferrets were, in his opinion, much worse than they were. Stoats and weasels went more for small birds and rabbits, but a ferret would attach a full-grown fowl. It was going rather far to ask the Government to put a sum on the estimates Mr. Monk never put there by the Government. Mr. MONK said they were getting on the North Cape. Mr. DUNCAN was of opinion that they had been carried there. They could not have found their own way there from the Wairarapa or the South Island. He did not see his way to put anything on the estimates until he saw there was more necessity for it than at present. Mr. MONK said they had been placed in the Wairarapa, and somehow they were persistently travelling northwards and increasing to a dan- gerous extent. Particularly little children were being bitten by them, and, as an instance, some of the brutes had taken up their abode under his son's house, and it was difficult to get rid of them. Mr. DUNCAN could inform the honourable member that the Government never placed any in the North Island. The honourable member would have to read his history. Mr. MONK said the Government sanctioned their being introduced there. Mr. DUNCAN .- The Government gave no special sanction, and those that were crying out about this pest were likely the very people who introduced them, and they should be respon- sible. LAND TAKEN FOR DRAINAGE PURPOSES. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) asked the Govern- ment, If they will provide some means whereby land taken for drainage purposes by a local body could be transferred more cheaply than at present ? The local bodies were very desirous to have some method by which land taken for drainage purposes might be transferred more cheaply than at present. Especially was this necessary in the case of small pieces of land. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) said this question appeared to relate to land taken com- pulsorily by Proclamation under " The Public Works Act, 1894." The expense which a local body was put to thereunder was : First, for a survey and plans of the land to be taken ; secondly, for twice advertising notice of inten- tion to take the. land ; and, thirdly, for ad- vertising the effect of the Proclamation once. The survey was the principal cost, and, as the title must be issued under the Land Transfer Act, the survey could not generally be done without, whether the land be taken by Procla- mation or by ordinary conveyance. The ad- vertising was necessary to give persons in- terested in the land proper notice, and, as no registration or transfer fees were charged, it was not easily seen how the cost could be cheapened. It was possible that in a few in- stances, where a small piece of land was required, it was cheaper to obtain it by con- voyance, if the owner was willing to sell ; but where much land was required a Proclamation was very much cheaper. Some local bodies employed lawyers to prepare the declaration and memorial to the Governor to issue the Pro- clamation and carry out the procedure laid down in the Act. This was quite unnecessary, 
<page:371>
department, and the Act was very plain as to what was required. So that if people under- stood the Act thoroughly they need not be put to so heavy expense as at present. Mr. J. ALLEN said it was a small piece of land. Mr. DUNCAN knew that. If people went about the matter in the right way, anything that the Government could do would not cheapen it, as nearly all the heavy outlay was made up by lawyers' fees. # WAIHI SWAMP. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) asked the Minister of Lands, Whether he will place a sum on the estimates sufficient to drain and road the valuable Waihi Swamp, situated between Po ngakawa and Maketu? This question had been asked several times, and, although it had been brought up every session, nothing seemed to have been done. Two sessions ago the Hon. Mr. Hall-Jones, who was then Acting Minister of Lands, suggested that a sum might be placed on the estimates as a preliminary expense, to see whether the work was worth going on with. If the present Minister of Lands did not see fit to do any more, he might adopt that course. It was a very important thing that this work should be carried out, and he thought it would be a really good thing if the Government drained this swamp. There was a similar swamp situated nearer Tauranga, which had proved to be a satisfactory investment to those who had  drained it. A drain through the swamp might be made at a cost of $2, or less, a chain, which would mean an expenditure of 2500 to make a drain for a mile and a half of road, which was all that was required. If that was so, it seemed to him that some expense should be gone to in order to carry out this work, as the area of the swamp was, he believed, 7.000 acres. Besides that, the road would open up several hundred thousand acres of Crown land. The Minister promised last session to inspect the swamp, but he did not fulfil his promise. Mr. DUNCAN .-- I visited the district, but I did not visit the swamp. Mr. HERRIES hoped the Minister would at least put a sum down for preliminary expenses, in order to test whether this swamp was good enough for draining. He (Mr. Herries) was satisfied it was. The settlers were of opinion that something ought to be done to open up this land. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) might state generally that peaty swamps involved much more trouble than was often expected. If this had been a silt swamp it would probably have been safe to promise that something should be done, and that right away; but it appeared that this was a six-foot peat swamp. Mr. HERRIES .- No. Mr. DUNCAN said that was the information supplied to him by the department. The de- partment reported,- "The Waihi Swamp contains about 3,000 acres, and is situated between the Pongakawa Stream and the Kaikokopu Stream. It is com- silt. If it was drained, cultivated, and exposed for some years it might be worth about $1 per acre." He questioned whether it would, because if you drained a peaty swamp it would very likely take fire before the next summer was over, and you could not stop it. The report went on, -- " The cost of draining about half of the best of it would amount to about $700. The Ponga- kawa Stream is very slow, but the Kaikokopu Stream is more rapid, running at the rate of about three miles an hour. The waters of the Kaikokopu Stream are, at ordinary water- level, from 1 ft. to 2 ft. below the banks. The Pongakawa flows level with its banks. In time of flood the stream brings down large quantities of pumice from the hills, and this pumice gets deposited in the slack water of the bends, and the river overflows the whole of the swamp. The same thing would probably happen to the drains, and they would consequently be a con- tinual source of expense to keep open. There is also considerable doubt as to whether the banks of the drains, which would probably have to be 6 ft. deep, would stand even at a very great batter. An experimental drain of about 100 chains in length might be made, and it would probably make about 500 acres dry, at a cost of about £60. If such a sum was provided on the estimates the experiment might be tried." From what he had seen of these swamps he was very doubtful whether the work would be a success. He was very sorry he did not see this swamp. It was the Tauranga people who put him from seeing this swamp. They desired him to go by another route, in order that he might see what they said was the best route to have their produce taken to market. So that it was not altogether his fault that he did not see the swamp. He was very dubious about these peaty swamps-he had known so many of them which had been failures. They had cost a lot. of money. He therefore hesitated to put any large sum down to have this place properly examined. Mr. HERRIES asked if the Minister would put down a sum to make the experimental drain. Mr. DUNCAN .- No. IMPORTED STUD HORSES. Mr. BENNET (Tuapeka) asked the Minister for Agriculture, If he will have one of the light imported stud horses stationed in the Crookston and Tapanui districts, and one in the Tuapeka district ? The farmers in these districts were very anxious to have one of the light imported stud horses stationed in their districts. The settlers in the districts referred to had a good class of horses, and were anxious to improve their stock, so that they could supply remounts for South Africa or to the Imperial army. He hoped the Minister would be able to comply with the request. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister for Agriculture) was very sorry there were so few horses to distribute in the country districts. Two horses were 
<page:372>
Zealand. He might state that one of these horses was being sent to a convenient place in Southland, below the Clutha, so that any one having suitable mares might send them to that horse. The horse would be contiguous to the railway, and in a fixed place. He wished to do what was best and fair in this matter to all districts in the colony. The trouble was they had not enough horses for all districts in the colony. ADVANCES TO SETTLERS OFFICE. Mr. BARCLAY (Dunedin City) asked the Minister in charge of Advances to Settlers, If he will cause steps to be taken which will ob- viate the difficulty of borrowers from the Ad- vances to Settlers Office being obliged to finance for a period before they receive their deeds, when paying off their morgages upon a sale of the land, or borrowing from a new lender ? This question had been put under circum- stances which he had already explained to the Minister, and had dealt with at some length on another occasion in the House during this session, on the second reading of the Advances to Settlers Extension Act. The difficulty was that the Advances to Settlers Office, when re- leasing a mortgage, before they would sign the release, required the actual cash to be placed in their hands. This was a course which was quite unusual, and gave rise to great incon- venience, because the purchasers of a property would not hand over the purchase-money until  they saw the necessary legal documents and the release of the mortgage executed. Mr. MILLS ; Minister in charge of Advances to Settlers) said that it was the custom of the     office to have the money paid in before the Board signed a release of a mortgage, and for this reason : that on one occasion the Board signed the release, but the mortgagor was unable to fulfil his part of the contract, and therefore the deeds had simply to remain in the safe, and it was not considered wise to do that any more. The Board was very willing and anxious to offer every facility to mortgagors, and the interest was only charged on "instalment " loans up to the date of repayment, which was a great con- cession, because, of course, in most cases the private investor required six months' notice or the payment of six months' interest to release a mortgage, except at due date of maturity. Only two objections had been raised by two solicitors in the whole colony regarding this matter. He had explained why the Board con- sidered it necessary to use every safeguard until the money was actually paid into the Advances to Settlers Office, or into some post-office ; but to facilitate matters, any man who did borrow was not compelled to repay the principal in Wellington, as payment was accepted by the Superintendent at any money-order post-office ; and there need not be any serious delay, as directly he was advised of the money being paid in, the business was brought before the Board at its first meeting, or, if neces- sary, the Superintendent called the Poard to- Mr. Duncan little time was lost by doing this. Again, the office did not insist on the interest on a loan being repaid at Wellington, as it could be paid into any post-office in the colony. This was another concession to those who wished to bor- row from the office; and the Superintendent advised him that their method of doing business had been found to work most satisfactorily for the time the Board had been in existence ; but he also considered that if the Board had to meet and sign these deeds, and then the mort- gagor did not fulfil his part of the bargain, it would not leave the securities in the position they ought to be in. He thought the honour-  able gentleman would realise from this explana- tion that the Board was willing to meet and oblige applicants in every reasonable way. Mr. BARCLAY said that, arising out of the Minister's reply, he would like to ask the honourable gentleman if he was aware that the system adopted by the Board in question was not adopted by any other department in the Government service. It was not adopted by any private lender, person, company, or individual in the colony; that the system in question was absolutely and entirely unique, and, so far from being found to work satis- factorily, it had been found to work very un-  satisfactorily. He would also like to ask the Minister if he was aware that the release signed by the Board had no value whatever until it was handed over and registered ; and also if he 1 was aware that if the release be signed, and the date not inserted until the money was actually paid over, the deed could be held in the safe, and no possible harm or danger could arise. Mr. MILLS thought he had already answered all that the honourable gentleman had asked him the second time. He had explained that the office thought it advisable in the public interest not to sign the deeds until they knew for certain that the money would be found, and this could be done in a very simple way by the man who had the money paying it into the post-office in any part of the colony, and wiring to the Super- intendent that he had done so. The office were not asking any man to trust them more than they were prepared to trust him ; so that he still thought, under all the circumstances, although the private lenders might not adopt that system, it was advisable in the interests of "safe lending " to continue it. Mr. BARCLAY asked why other Government departments did not do it. DUTY ON GOLD-SAVING FABRICS. Mr. GUINNESS (Grey) asked the Govern- ment, If they will favourably consider the advisability of repealing the present duty on plush and other textile fabrics used for gold- saving ? He might inform the honourable gentleman that a large quantity of this material was in demand, and was required for the purpose of saving the fine gold from the large slicing claims and dredges ; and it was a fabric which could not be manufactured in the colony, and it was on precisely the same footing as the 
<page:373>
gold-mining machinery and chemicals used in gold-saving, which were allowed to come in duty - free. The plushes and gold-saving cloths he referred to were manufactured in a particular manner especially for the gold- mining industry, and therefore were not suit- able for dress or other purposes. The first cost could not be said to be much, but when you added to the value a percentage on importation, and the 20 per cent. duty, it came very ex- pensive-especially when you remembered also that such a large quantity was used in saving gold, and the difference between profit and loss in saving fine gold was now cut so fine that this duty made just the difference in many cases between the claim paying or not. He hoped the honourable gentleman would give this matter his careful consideration, so that he should be able to communicate, not only to his own constituents, but to all those engaged in the gold-mining industry throughout New Zea- land, a favourable answer to this question. Mr. MILLS (Commissioner of Customs) said there was always a great difficulty in ascertain- ing that the articles the honourable member for the Grey referred to would only be used for the purposes he specified. The articles could be used in many other ways. That was the light in which the department viewed the question. Of course, the honourable gentleman had indi- cated by his question that it could not be done without some alteration in the tariff, as the article was clearly specified, and the amount of duty to be collected upon it. All that he could promise the honourable gentleman was this : that if at any time there should be a revision of the tariff he would bring this request before Cabinet for their consideration. MAKOHINE VIADUCT. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) moved, That there be laid before this House a return showing the expenditure incurred in connection with the construction of the Makohine Viaduct up to the 30th June last ; also the estimated cost of the viaduct when complete, and the date on which the Public Works Department expect it to be open for traffic. He would like to know if there was any objection to this, because, if not, he would move it formally. Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister for Public Works) said he would have preferred the honourable member to have waited until the viaduct was completed. In regard to the latter part of the motion, he had already told the House that he not only hoped to have the viaduct completed this summer, but he hoped to have the trains running to Manga- weka. They were very near to the completion of this work. With some alterations, he did not object to the motion. For instance, the department had to buy a plant for the manu- facture of the ironwork, which would also be used in connection with some of the bridges ahead, and therefore it should not be charged against this one work. Then, he would like to point out that there were additions to the work, as carried out, that were not con- templated when tenders were invited. For instance, the tenders provided for sinking the concrete foundations to a certain depth, but it was found in carrying out the work that it was necessary to go several yards deeper to get a solid foundation. What the honourable gentle- man wanted to get at was a comparison between the cost of the work as done and the amount of the lowest tender received. He was quite prepared to give that if the honour- able member would agree to these additions to his motion, namely : After the words "30th June last," to add "allowing a fair proportion of the cost of machinery for the manufacture of ironwork, et cetera; also for extra work beyond that specified and provided for when tenders were invited ; the lowest tender re- ceived ; and." Mr. MASSEY said he had no objection to the addition of these words to his motion. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) said he hoped the Minister would give that proportion of the cost which referred to the special plant separately from the total cost of the viaduct to date, be- cause he thought we ought to know the cost of that proportion of the plant. If the cost was all lumped together it would be of no use. Mr. HALL-JONES said he would see that the return was so clear that every member could understand it. Mr. J. ALLEN asked, Would the Minister show that cost separately ? Mr. HALL-JONES said he had already stated that he would see that the return was quite clear. If the honourable member did not want to accept his assurance he need not. Mr. J. ALLEN said he had no doubt the return would be so clear that honourable mem- bers would understand it. He wanted to un- derstand what the proportion of cost of the special plant was, and also the cost of the work apart from this plant; and he rose to ask the Minister if the cost of the viaduct would be shown apart altogether from the cost of the plant. He desired, equally with the Minister, to see a return of the fair cost of the work. Mr. HALL-JONES said it would be pre- sented, and also the cost of the special plant. Mr. J. ALLEN asked, Would it be shown separately ? Mr. HALL-JONES said it would be shown. Mr. R. MCKENZIE (Motueka) pointed out that in its present form the motion conveyed no information at all. What was wanted was a return showing the cost of the foundations, the cost of concrete in the viaduct, and the cost of all the material separately, so that they might be able to compare it with other works through- out the country, and also so that they might see whether reasonable progress had been made. The return the honourable member had moved for would give them no information. He would like very much to have it amended, or, failing that, to move for a separate return. Mr. HALL-JONES said the mover of the return was quite satisfied he would get what he wanted. He would get the cost of the work, and a certain proportion would be de- ducted for the cost of the machinery. That would give exactly what Mr. Allen was asking 
<page:374>
for, but that honourable member was so very suspicious that he (Mr. Hall-Jones) would not agree to put the return in the form that he desired to stipulate it should be. From the return that would be presented any member "could make a comparison between the amount that the work was tendered for and the cost of the work as done. Mr. J. ALLEN said the return they wanted was a very valuable one, and one that they should have. The work ought to have been started five years ago by tender, and, according to the contract, the work would have been com- pleted in two years and a half. He did not say whether the work could or could not have been done in that time, but the men accepted such conditions when tendering. Double the time had been occupied already that the contractor would have taken. What they wanted, and what he claimed the country had a right to have, was a comparison as between the cost of this viaduct erected as it had been under Go- vernment control, and by a particular class of labour, and the probable cost of the viaduct to the colony if it had been erected by contract. This return which was now proposed to be laid on the table would give them no infor mation at all that would be of any value in making that comparison ; and the fact that the Minister refused time after time to answer a plain question he put to him regarding the way the return was to be placed on the table was evidence to him that it was done delibe-  rately. He hoped the Minister would recede from that position, and let them know the full particulars. There was no harm in the colony knowing the cost of the viaduct apart alto-   gether from the cost of the plant. If the Minis- ter desired to place a proportion of the cost of the plant against the cost of the construc- tion, let him put it in a separate item. He would not gainsay that, and no one would object to it ; but he maintained that the two things should be shown separately. In the Minister's own interests, he ought not to put the whole cost in one lump sum, because that would make it appear to the outside world that this viaduct had cost a great deal more than it actually had cost. Mr. HALL-JONES. - I will give a return that will satisfy the honourable member for Franklin. Mr. J. ALLEN said Mr. Massey appeared to him to be very easily satisfied in this matter. If the return was put in as amended, and if, in addition to the cost of the work, a proportion of the cost of the plant was added, it would show a much larger sum expended on this viaduct than was necessary. He had no objection to a proportion of the cost of the plant being shown, but separately. They only wanted a plain statement of plain facts, and he did not know why the Minister did not want to give it to them. Evidently his desire was to so concoct the return that it would not give the information that some members of the House thought that they and the country ought to have. He did not wish to block the return or waste time, but the return as pro- Mr Hall-Jones posed to be laid on the table would be of little service to them. Mr. WARD (Minister for Railways) said it appeared to him to be very difficult to please the honourable member. The Minister in charge had stated that he would have a return prepared to place the matter fairly before the House, so that every member could understand it. The honourable member for Franklin had accepted the assurance of the Minister that the return would be of such a nature as to satisfy him; and yet the honourable member for Bruce, in his fastidious exactitude about the return the  Minister proposed to place before the House, found fault with the Government for not hav-  ing accepted the original tender. The reason it was declined was that it was too high, and the honourable member on that built up a theory that it was going to take five years to do the work, as against two years and a half, the time originally fixed for the contract. Nothing of the kind. From the date of the commence- ment of the manufacture, the Makohine Via- duct was not going to take more than three years and a half-from the beginning to the end of the whole business. Honourable mem- bers, after hearing the criticisms of the honour- able member for Bruce, would allow him, on behalf of the Government, to say that after the Government decided that the original tenders were too high, and had made up their minds to build the viaduct under the Public Works Department - after that, there was a British engineering strike, and material went up considerably. It was all very well for honourable members to say what would have been done had the original tender been ac- cepted. There was a well-known saying on the English Stock Exchange that it was the easiest thing in the world to job backwards ; and that was what the honourable member was trying to do. With the knowledge of after- events, which neither he nor any one else could foresee, he wished them to believe that it would have been very much easier for the Govern- ment to have done the work as originally pro- posed. The honourable member was one who doubtless could make water run uphill. He had found fault with the return actually before it had been laid upon the table of the House. Surely the proper course would be to await the production of the return, and then, if the infor- mation contained therein was considered insuffi- cient, it would be for any honourable member to ask for an extension of the return, contain- 1 ing such further information as was desired. Honourable members knew that great efforts were being made to push on the North Island Trunk Railway and bring it to a finish ; and, as the completion of the Makohine Viaduct was essential before the line could be utilised, he thought to complete the viaduct within three years and a half of its start by the Public Works Department was highly creditable ; and when a return was offered by the Minister for Public Works, and assented to by the honour- able member for Franklin-the mover for the return - upon the lines indicated, it was a great pity that such remarks should have been made 
<page:375>
intended to discredit the construction of the Makohine Viaduct, which, unfortunately, some persons had been trying to discount most un- fairly for some time past. It would be found that there was nothing in what the honourable member had stated, and that the Public Works Department was doing all it could to push the work on, and have it completed in sufficient time to be utilised for general traffic. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) did not understand the honourable member for Bruce: he never could. His difficulty was to ascertain what the honourable member was driving at. He had heard the question asked,- Why has not man a microscopic eye ? For this plain reason : man is not a dy. Evidently the honourable gentleman had a fly's eye, and saw in this motion what it was impossible for other honourable members to see. What did the motion ask for ? This : "That there be laid before this House a return showing the expenditure incurred in connec- tion with the construction of the Makohine Via- duct up to the 30th June last." To persons of average comprehension that was surely suffi- ciently expressive. It asked, further, for " the estimated cost of the viaduct when complete and the date on which the Public Works Depart- ment expect it to be open for traffic." That ex- pressed everything that could possibly be desired in connection with public expenditure upon the Makohine Viaduct. Then, as if the motion was not sufficiently expressive, the mover and the  Minister for Public Works afterwards consulted, and agreed upon certain amendments, which were quite satisfactory to the honourable member for Franklin, who moved the motion. Then, they were told by the honourable member for Bruce that the honourable member for Frank- lin acceded to the amendment suggested by the Hon. the Minister for Public Works because of his innocence of parliamentary wiles. This was the very first time he had ever heard it stated that the member for Franklin was so innocent as to fall into the traps laid for him by the Minister for Public Works. Surely it could not be said there was anything underhand in what those two honourable gentlemen had done. They had all seen them walk to the table of the House and consult as to the amendments to be in- serted which would give effect to the views which they both held. More than that : the Minister for Public Works had promised the House that he would put the terms of the motion in such a form as to make it understandable even to that member of the House who might be possessed of the meanest comprehension of them all. If the member for Bruce had his microscope about him he wished the honour- able member would lend it to him, so that he might be able to see what the honourable gentle- man was driving at. When the honourable member for Franklin replied, he (Mr. Fisher) hoped he would say what interpretation he placed upon the speech of the honourable member for Bruce. And, as to his being im- posed upon by the Minister for Public Works, it should be remembered that the honourable position amongst those gentlemen who sat in that cold region on that far-off side of the House. He (Mr. Fisher) thought the member for Franklin was able to take care of himself without the assistance of the member for Bruce. It must be evident to the member for Franklin that the member for Bruce had his interests somewhat too closely at heart. He hoped the House would agree to the motion in its amended form. Mr. MILLS (Commissioner of Customs) had heard the motion read, and had understood it very clearly. The honourable member for Franklin was perfectly satisfied with the expla- nation given by the Minister for Public Works, and agreed to accept the return asked for with some slight alteration. If the honourable mem- ber for Bruce wished to have any further in- formation than that expressed in this motion he could give notice of it. That would be a very simple matter, and one that could be dealt with in the usual course. But what he had risen for principally was to deny the statement that the Minister for Public Works had any idea of doing what the honourable member for Bruce said-namely, to concoct a return. He objected to those words being used, because he thought they were unfair, and they naturally tended to cause unpleasantness and lead to a protracted discussion. He was quite satisfied that when the return asked for was produced it would satisfy honourable members, including even the honourable member for Bruce. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston) said there was one objection to the motion as amended by the Minister- Mr. FISHER .- I thought so. Mr. PIRANI said he thought that, if the Minister put the value of the machinery when the work was completed, there might be some- thing in it, because some of the machinery would undoubtedly be of very little further use, and a deduction ought to be made to that effect. Otherwise he did not see how the motion could be improved. As it was, the Minister would give only what he thought fit. It would there- fore be of advantage to get him to furnish a return giving some information about the matter. In the discussions that had taken place it had been stated that the work had cost a great deal more through being carried out by the Government than if it had been done under the contract system. To his mind, it was far more important to know whether the work was being carried out expeditiously than what the cost would be, for the reason that the longer the work took the longer would they have to pay interest on the cost of the rest of the line that was being completed. Independent of the cost altogether, he would like to have some indication given as to the probable date on which the work would be finished. Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) said, a short time ago he replied to a question put by the honourable member for Franklin. He claimed that he had not spoken to the motion. He had no wish whatever to prevent the motion being put to the House, 
<page:376>
honourable member for Bruce if it did not come on. As amended, the motion was fair, and he had not the slightest objection to give every item as he had intimated. He believed the honourable member for Franklin was satisfied, but the honourable member for Bruce - suspicion was familiar to him-wanted to make out that something was underlying it all. Some six or eight months ago the statement had been made that the Makohine Viaduct had then cost $43,000 more than the lowest tender that had been received. He had no hesita- tion in saying that a man who could make a statement such as that was only fit for one place, and that place was a lunatic asylum. He would give honourable members the in- formation as desired by the honourable member for Franklin, and it would be information that would satisfy every member, with the exception of one, and that one member was the member for Bruce - no man on these benches could give information that would satisfy him. If he gave the exact information he would be satisfied, but if the return showed something wrong he had no doubt the honourable member would get such a return as he desired. He could assure him and other honourable members that he would be pleased to give all the information that had been asked for, to show that the absurd rumours concerning that particular work had no foundation whatever. As to the question of the honourable member for Pal- merston, he did not care how the matter was  put. What he said before he would repeat : If the honourable member for Bruce were to pro- vide an engine and rolling-stock to take coal from a coal-mine, he would not charge the cost of that engine and rolling-stock against a certain quantity of coal carried, but would distribute the cost over a certain period. There was no doubt that some of the machinery used at the viaduct would be almost as good as when it was first purchased, and would be used to manu- facture a quantity of ironwork for other bridges. He maintained that it would be grossly unfair to charge the whole cost against that one work, when it was to be used for other purposes. That was why he asked the honourable mem- ber for Franklin to agree to a fair proportion of the cost of the machinery being charged against this viaduct. He did not object to the sugges- tion to have the machinery valued on the com- pletion of the work, and to make that a set-off against the work. As to the time that had been taken over the erection of this viaduct, he did not think it was excessive when compared with other works. It was true they had sent Home for the machinery some time in 1898, but the last of it did not arrive in the colony until June, 1898 ; and without that machinery they could not start manufacturing the iron- work. On the 14th September, 1898, that work was begun, and his colleague had stated he desired to have trains running over the via- duct within three years and a half from that time. It was not an unusual thing for con- tractors to be behind time in completing their work. The Commissioner of Customs could Mir. Hall. Jones other members could do the same. The mem- ber for Waitemata had not forgotten the con- tract for a certain tunnel that was going on in his district which was finished three years after contract time. To show the difference between the contract and the system adopted in that case, he would say that the contractors for that tunnel, on the recommendation of a Committee of the House, were paid something like $3,500 in settlement of their claims; and in a Dunedin case the contractor was two years over his contract time. It was not done by the Public Works Department ; but it was the result of insufficient experience on the part of the contractors, for they did not make themselves acquainted with the nature of the country they had to pierce through, and they were not experienced in tunnel-making ; they came across a class of country most difficult to deal with. However, they were doing very well at Makohine, and honourable members must not think the time engaged in the work was excessive. When honourable members got the return they would be satisfied, and would see that the work has not eight months ago cost $43,000 more than the lowest tender. He hoped the honourable member for Bruce would be more cautious in the future, and, as one of our rising statesmen, he should show more faith in human nature. When the return was laid on the table he hoped the honourable member for Bruce would apologize for what he had said. Mr. HASELDEN (Patea) said the member for Bruce only asked for a plain answer to a plain question, and had the Minister given a plain answer it would have saved considerable time. Mr. HALL-JONES .- That is what I did. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) did not think there was very much that he had to reply to. He should have preferred to get the return in the form in which it was originally moved, but if he could not get that he was willing to take what he could get. The return was asked for under three headings, namely : "That there be laid before this House a return showing the expenditure incurred in connection with the construction of the Makohine Viaduct up to the 30th June last." The Minister offered to give the whole return if he would consent to amend the first part of it in this way : "allowing a fair proportion of the cost of machinery for the manufacture of ironwork." He under- stood that certain machinery had been pur- chased for the construction of the Makohine Viaduct, but it would also be used in the con- struction of other viaducts. He (Mr. Massey) thought that a fair proportion of the cost of such machinery should be charged to other viaducts-that was to say, that only a part should be charged to the Makohine Viaduct. He thought the suggestion of the honourable gentleman was not unreasonable, and on that account he agreed to it. The other parts of the return were not interfered with. We were to have the estimated cost of the viaduct when complete; the date upon which it was expected 
<page:377>
further heading that was not included in the original return-namely, the lowest tender re- ceived for the construction of the work. So that the return would include four headings instead of three. He hoped, at all events, that the discussion that afternoon would have the effect of hurrying on the Public Works Depart- ment, so that trains would be running over the line at the earliest possible date. Motion, as amended, agreed to. # CONCILIATION BOARDS. Mr. GRAHAM (Nelson City). - I beg to move, That there be laid before this House a return, in continuation of H .- 17, 1900, show- ing,-(1) The number of Conciliation Boards elected or appointed in the colony since March, 1900, and the present total number of such Boards ; (2) the total cost of all such elections ; (3) the number of disputes referred to Concilia- tion Boards, and the trades and industries in- volved ; (4) the number of persons cited to appear as parties in such disputes : (5) the number of disputes in which the awards were agreed to by such parties to such disputes ; (6) the number of disputes in which the parties failed to agree to such awards: (7) the scale of fees paid to Chairmen and members of Con- ciliation Boards for their services, and the total sum of such payments ; (8) the scale of pay- ments for travelling and other expenses, and the total sum of such payments ; (9) the num- ber of persons to whom such payments have  been made ; (10) the total cost to date of administering the Act, as far as Concilia- tion Boards are concerned; and (11) the number of days each Board has sat during each year since the passing of "The Indus- trial Conciliation and Arbitration Act, 1894." This, Sir, is simply a continuation of an almost identical return that was asked for and granted without discussion last year. The only differ- ence is that in the return now asked for the number of persons cited to appear as parties in disputes before Conciliation Boards is required to be given, and the number of days each Board has sat in each year since the passing of the original Act. The return, which will be useful and instructive, will be neither lengthy nor difficult to furnish, as shown by the return granted last year, and, as I have no doubt the Minister will be prepared to agree to the motion, I shall refrain from provoking discussion and simply move the motion. Mr. SEDDON (Premier). - It is perhaps opportune on this motion to place on record the position, and I think it is scarcely just or fair that there should be that wholesale con- demnation that at the present time has been made. For instance, it is sought to make a discrimination as between the various workings The mem- of the several Conciliation Boards. ber for Dunedin City (Mr. Millar) naturally desired to know, and may possibly question the Minister of Labour in the House, as to whether something that I said applied to the Concilia- tion Board at Dunedin. I do not know that he is justified in asking the question, and I might the time I made the statement-and I have nothing to withdraw-in Auckland, there were four hundred people cited in connection with the carters' dispute, and the question naturally arose in my mind, What necessity was there for four hundred persons being cited to appear before the Conciliation Board to deal with a simple question as to whether the wages paid for cart- ing was fair or otherwise. I subsequently re- ceived a telegram from the secretary of one of the unions, and he said it was not the union that did it ; but that after the union had cited the number they thought fair and sufficient, the cited parties insisted upon a large number of others being brought into the fold, and it was they who were responsible for the situation. This is not the only case ; and where you find that interested parties, with a view to discredit- ing the legislation and of causing friction, take an action of that kind, then I say we ought to put the blame upon the right shoulders, and say to the persons who do that that they must take the responsibility. Coming back to the Con- ciliation Boards, I have no hesitation in saying that, to my mind, in some respects the conduct of their business is unbusinesslike. An Hon. MEMBER .- A guinea a day. Mr. SEDDON .- No; I do not think we should attribute to men intrusted with such responsi- bilities that they are acting from sordid or selfish motives. I think we ought to be fair and generous, and give them full credit, because their position at the best is a most unpleasant one. We should not forget that one side is elected by the unionists and the other by the employers ; and it is the same as the Arbitra- tion Court : as a rule, each one goes there to do his best for the particular party or section that he represents. I say that the construction of the Board, under these circumstances, is open to question, and that we should not there- fore blame those who have been intrusted with this responsibility. It may be that they are lacking in experience, and I think they are somewhat blamable. Witnesses come forward, and it is easily known if their evidence is simply a repetition. Take the evidence of Smith, Brown. Jones, Robinson, Williams, and others : their evidence may be similar to that previously given by Roberts. It is only when a witness has something fresh to say, or can throw new light on a subject, that his evi- dence should be taken. I have read in the papers time after time - and I have carefully noted what is going on -- that many witnesses are heard who simply repeat, parrot-like, what has been already said by others. I say, in such cases the Board has a duty to perform, the same as a Magistrate or a Judge. In such cases I say the Boards have something to answer for. An Hon. MEMBER .- That would have the effect of reducing the number of sittings. An Hon. MEMBER. - And the number of guineas they get by it. Mr. SEDDON .- It would facilitate business. An Hon. MEMBER .- And facilitate reducing the cost. 
<page:378>
generous ; because you do not know what you may come to yourself. The senior member for Wellington City is laughing ; he is the first man, I believe, who would be selected as a member of a Board. Proceeding now with the constitution of the Boards, I want to say that, in my opinion, the manner in which the Boards are now selected is defective. You place practically two partisans on the Board in our manner of election, and experience has proved that this does not lead to conciliation. Then, what has been the remedy suggested? One is that there should be a permanent Chairman, and that in respect to each subject coming under dispute you should call in two experts, who shall assist the Chair- man in coming to a conclusion. I see the same difficulty again there, when you bring in these experts .- An Hon. MEMBER .- Not if they have got billets. Mr. SEDDON .- You have to pay them when they sit. An Hon. MEMBER .- Let their own people pay them. Mr. SEDDON. - At present I think the working-men have enough to pay, and it would be an impost they could not bear. That would be the answer to that suggestion. I say the State is the right party to pay. But you would have partisanship in the selection of the experts. Who is going to select them ? The Chairman would select them; and he would select a worker who is an expert, and by so doing  please the working section ; and he would then select an employer, and you would have the same trouble with your Board so constituted. What, in my opinion, would be an improvement,     and that I think would lead to greater facility and more conciliation and greater convenience, would be to have one or two men with legal training, with experience in taking evidence, and who are beyond and above party, and whose only object could be to endeavour to carry out their duty, and conciliate and give such an award as would meet the case in accordance with the evidence. Mr. HUTCHESON .- It is a question of the right men. Mr. SEDDON .- " It is a question of the right men." Well, I believe some of our oldest and best-trained Magistrates would be the best men to undertake the work. An Hon. MEMBER. - The best for Chairman, anyhow. Mr. SEDDON .- Yes ; that is the view I hold. We have had cases where there has been no trouble at all. But what I ask at present is that there should not be wholesale condemnation or judgment on those persons holding the positions. If there is a defect in the law, Parliament is responsible, and not those who are called upon to administer the law as they find it. The other question is this : It does appear at the present time-and has for some time past-that you cannot take up your newspaper without seeing column after column taken up with some dispute before the Conciliation Board. Who is re- is. And why ? Because of late years we have extended the application of the Act. Under the interpretation of " Industries," the Arbi- tration Court held that two - thirds of the workers were not included under the Act, not being engaged in industry, and, the interpreta- sion being so held, we had then to widen the law to embrace these workers. Now, those in- dustries that came in under the extended juris- diction of the Boards have never had any award at all. An Hon. MEMBER .- They are not creating the trouble now. Mr. SEDDON .- I say now is the first oppor- tunity they have had to come before the Board 1 preparatory to going before the Arbitration Court, and I would say this: With this fact before members, and the people and Press of the colony, we should give time to these indus- tries which came in under the extension of the Act-we should give them opportunity to get their awards; and then, in my opinion, there ought to be a lull-a cessation from what appears to be at present an incessant strife between the employers and the employed. It is scarcely fair to have these adverse criti- cisms. Then, when you turn over your news- paper, you get the Conciliation Board in one column and the Arbitration Court in another. Why is this? Owing to circumstances over which neither the Government nor Parliament have any control, the work of the Arbitration Court has got behind. In some cases men have been nearly two years without getting their dis- putes finally settled. We have it now from the President of the Court, that after a short time every dispute will be settled, and the awards will be made, and I am looking forward to the beginning of next year to find that there are no disputes at all between employer and employed. It is fair to give the return, but in giving it there should be this explanation ; otherwise it might appear by the return as if by comparison disputes were being promoted, and, judging from the return, there would be evidence to support that view. It is not fair to come to such a con- clusion, and it should be understood that by the widening of the law and the enlargement of the scope of its application you have the number of disputes increased, and there has been no oppor- tunity yet of awards being given. When the Court is cleared off I anticipate you will have, to a certain extent, industrial peace. I make these remarks because there has been a certain amount of feeling engendered in respect to the matter. I say to those who are fanning the flame, be careful. There has been trouble before on this matter, and this manner of adjusting the dis- putes is, I should say, very much more satis- factory than the way in which these disputes used to be settled ; and to cause a difference of opinion, and ill-feeling, as between the workers in the towns and the workers in the country is, in my opinion, unpatriotic. And not only that, but it would be almost impossible then to settle the disputes. What is being aimed at by this agitation, I am sorry to say, is an endeavour to create feeling as between the 
<page:379>
workers in the towns and the farmers in the ; this House, say - neither have I seen them country, and the object underlying it is put forward as the benefit of the workers. How can it prove beneficial to the farmers? My answer is No. I say the welfare of the farmer is inseparably bound up with the welfare and well-being of the worker in the towns. An Hon. MEMBER .- It is the other way about. Mr. SEDDON. - I say that you cannot separate the interests of the two, and the best market for the farmer and the nearest for his produce is within New Zealand itself. If he supplies the towns of New Zealand with his produce he has no middleman to pay ; he has no shipping freights to pay; and therefore I again say that his home market, which is his nearest, is his best. And the more you enlarge that market, and the more you improve the condi- tion of the consumers of the colony, the more you will benefit the colony and its producers, and those who strive to do that are public bene- factors, and are engaged in a patriotic work. But as to those who, on the other hand, try to create strife and to foster ill-feeling as between town and country, they are traitors to the country they live in, and wrong-doers. An Hon. MEMBER .- Have you not done it ? Mr. SEDDON .- No, Sir, I have never ap- proved of it. I hold broad views upon every question, and I am not one of those narrow- minded individuals who to suit their own pur-  poses abandon the principles that they hold, because they think it might benefit them politically. I say that the man who takes a broad view of this question, and works out the problem accordingly, is the man in whom in course of time all parties will have confidence, and not those who are endeavouring for the time being-as I know they are -to set the country districts 'and producers against the towns. I must say that, as far as the towns are concerned, and the representatives of the towns. they are not doing that. It is coming from the one side ; and why? I will prove to you very easily what is underlying the whole matter. The present Liberal party has now an al- most universal town and country support. There was a time when the party received the larger portion of its support from the towns, and when it was closely identified with labour and labour questions. But of late years the country districts have sent supporters to the Liberal party in this House, and the result has been to the profit of the country districts, and of the farmers and the producers of the country; and I have no hesitation in saying that at the present time, with a view, possibly, to altering this condition, our friends opposite are doing all they can to show that the farmers are not receiving justice, and are trying to make out that those in the towns are endea- vouring to obtain for themselves that which they would deny to their fellow-men in the country. My answer to that is that there is no foundation for it. I have never heard a working-man in any town in this colony, or any body of workmen, or their representatives in do-anything which would militate against the prosperity and well-being of the country. Now, here is another question : People are being told time after time that the Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act was intended to apply to the farmers, and that it was to be used for the purpose of crushing the farmers -- that if an accident happens to a farmer's em- ployé such accident means the ruin of the un- fortunate farmer. Now, I say again that those people who are making such statements are doing wrong, and that that law does not apply to the farmers. I say that when this matter was before the House we were all under the im- pression that it did not apply to the farming community. How, then, can it now be said that there was any attempt made by Parlia- ment, or by any party, to use this legislation- initiated by the people in the towns-for the de- triment of the people in the country? If that is the assumption upon which this legislation was passed, I go further, and say that there is no Act that is perfect when passed. But we have our Courts of law; and I say that it will be quite time enough when any Court of law decides that the intention of Parliament has not been given effect to in the legislation it passed - that this Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act does apply to the farmers and those engaged upon the farms-to alter the law. I say that as soon as we get an interpretation from the Court to that effect it will be our duty to alter the law and make it consistent with what we intended. An Hon. MEMBER .- Will you do it ? Mr. SEDDON .- I will, certainly. As soon as there is sufficient evidence to the effect that the Act has an application we never intended, it will be my duty to give effect to the intention of the Legislature. But in the meantime we must stand by the law. Then, again, I will give another answer : It was stated on the floor of this House, by gentlemen who were them- selves engaged in agricultural or pastoral pur- suits, that they were insuring their employés under the Employers' Liability Act before the Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act was passed at all. I say that such was the case. The late member for Wairarapa was one of the members who stated this, and I know that there were hundreds of employers who did the same. They actually claimed that they were safer, under the Workers' 5.0. Compensation for Accidents Act that we passed, than they were under the in- definite legislation of the Employers' Liability Acts -that there was an indefinite obli- gation without any limit whatever, and gene- rally with litigation that was almost ruinous. I therefore say that they forget now that the very ones who are arguing against the appli- cation of the Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act to the country districts are those who were asking for an amendment of the law to remove the disabilities under which they laboured under the Employers' Liability Act. I say, let there be a test case, and let the Court give its decision before they say that this 
<page:380>
Act does apply to them, or that it means ruin | to the farmers. Mr. FLATMAN. - Why not make it plain before any one is ruined. Mr. SEDDON .- If you are always going to legislate for everything that has never been in- terpreted by a Court where are you going to stop? To my mind the law is perfectly clear at present : and even supposing the law we passed, although not intended, did apply to the farmers, it is safer, more economical, and better for the farmers than the old Employers' Liability Act. That is my reply to that. However, Sir, I only rose, in respect to this motion, to do justice as far as I could to those who at the present time and under adverse circumstances are administering our laws. I say that a great deal of the blame that attaches to them should never be laid at their door, because we have widened the scope of the legislation-we have brought in a large number of trades and workers that the law previously did not apply to ; and, that being the case, we ought to give a fair time to the Boards and to the Court to do their work, and then after that I believe there will be a general consensus of opinion that we have done the right thing. Sir, I shall give the return, but I say its appli- cation will not be fair if given now, because of the extra work thrown on these bodies. I hope, Sir, that the information I give to the House will be accepted in the spirit in which it is given, and that it is done with a view to doing what is right to all parties concerned. Mr. MONK (Waitemata). - I would like to correct the impression which I think the Premier has that the Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act does not apply to the home-   steads of farmers. How is it, then, that it is being interpreted so by the legal fraternity, who are insisting now, in mortgages lent upon country lands, upon the insertion of a clause compelling the borrower to pay for a policy, so that the Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act, shall not interfere with their security ? Mr. SEDDON. - They may have some shares in this Oceanic Company. Mr. MONK .- I think that is very unfair. The Premier does not seem to desire know- ledge ; he only desires to bafile. Now, there is certainly a feeling throughout the country districts-and I say it with good reason-that the Premier is neglectful of the interests of the country people, and is simply conserving, as far as he possibly can, the interests of the city unions. When I put the question to him, asking if he would expand the workings of the Conciliation Boards and Arbitration Court, so as to enable them to operate in the interests of farmers, he would allow them no relief ; but they now show a disposition to help themselves. What was more equitable than my suggestion that the Conciliation Boards and Arbitration Court should be applied to matters relating to the country districts ? But he would not make this concession ; and I say, where was the con- cern he now professes for farmers, when he made all their local bodies subject to the deci- sions of the Conciliation Boards and unions in Mr. Seddon the cities, to their inconvenience? For, as I pointed out last session, the country people are receiving grants of money, and endeavouring to make them as productive as possible in the in- terests of roadmaking ; but they are not allowed to do so. It is in this way : In the winter time the country people are willing, in their own interests, to take jobs and to improve roads at a lower rate of wages than the city people rightly expect to receive; but they are pro- hibited from doing so, and must pay a cer- tain rate of wage, although the farmers them- selves are willing to employ their men and teams during the slack periods of the year at a lower rate of wages than would be accepted during the busy season. What was more inequitable than that a freedom of that kind should be taken away, and thereby the amount of improvement which these local bodies can secure out of their grants is limited ? Then, again, the Premier the other day said to a deputation which met him that the dairy and meat industries are receiving subsidies equal to $20,000 a year. Let me declare that the country people are getting no advantage from the regu- lations of the Goverment, but those for which they pay a price brings a profit to the Govern- ment. To commence with the sheep-tax. Does it not bring in a considerable revenue to the Government over and above the cost of inspec- tion, and the cost of that department ? What about the valuation of country lands by men who are travelling continually all over the country, and some of whom are, as the honourable member for Marsden said, simply ne'er-do-wells, and cost the people, mostly the farmers, $26,000 a year? Can the Premier point to one single department, professedly operating in the interests of the country people, upon which he is not in some form or other making a handsome profit ? Why, I believe that the Belfast meat-freezing establishment in Canterbury, as soon as the Slaughtering and Inspection Act is brought into operation, will have to pay a sum of not less than $853 a year, reckoning as a basis the number of animals killed last year, and upon that there will be a clear profit to the Government of over $400. Then, look at the price which the country people have been receiving for their oats down South. Now, the Premier took great credit to himself because orders had been received for 50,000 tons of oats-by the returns I see it is getting on to 800,000 bushels for the year. We are all very thankful that these oats have been sent away, but the producers of these oats have been receiving next door to starvation prices. I am informed that they have received 1s. to 1s. 2d., and in a few cases as much as 1s. 3d., a bushel, while the prices received by the middle- men have been 1s. 7d. to 1s. 9d. Who got the profit there? Not the farmer. Mr. SEDDON .- They will have to pay the freight, and the cost of rebagging. Mr. MONK .- We know that ; the prices I have mentioned has not covered that. An Hon. MEMBER .- What has this to do with Mr. Graham's return? Mr. MONK .- It has to do with the return, 
<page:381>
have to make an assertion on behalf of the country people that the labour legislation of the last few years has been continuously regardless of their interests, and the Premier is conscious of it, and is seeking to confuse the position. The country people do not wish to be in op- position to the city folks, nor in mere opposition to the unions of the city, they simply desire to have the privilege of forming themselves into a union for the management of their own in- terests, and nothing can be more just and equi- table. I should like the House to take notice of this : If unions are right in one class of the community, can it be wrong that similar privi- leges should be allowed to others? And that is all the farmers are asking. And if the farmers form themselves into associations and into unions they will not come to the Ministry for help ; they will simply take their own business into their hands, and they will regulate freights, appoint their agents, and manipulate all produce in the Old Country. They will not be a plague to the Government, but rather a moderate, though powerful, organization to in- struct and guide them. Mr. MORRISON .- It is time these things were changed. They have been in the habit of coming to the Government for everything they could get. Mr. MONK .- It is all very well for the honourable gentleman to make assertions, but assertions are not facts. Mr. MORRISON .- I will prove it. Mr. MONK .- I do not think the honourable  gentleman can prove it, when they have sup- plied over eleven out of the thirteen millions of our last year's exports. When the estimates come down it will be easy to point out to the House the large amount that has been paid by the country people. As an instance of hard- ship, have the Government forgotten the valua- tion-rolls, for which the local bodies are charged one-third ? And I do not think the Premier could furnish a single instance in which that return was satisfactory and could be used by the local body until they themselves had cor- rected it. And, Sir, so audacious were the charges made by the Valuation Department that the Government, for very shame's sake, were compelled to make large reductions. Mr. SEDDON .- The impression is that the Valuation Department is improving every day. Mr. MONK. - How can the department possibly improve when men put in responsible positions in it are inept at the work they have to do? There is a gentleman at the head of a department in the South --- I will not mention names-and the Government know that not only in that case, but in many others, instances of which members bring before the House, the men whom they have put in these positions are, some of them, known as failures, though they are, I admit, men who are very assiduous in their duties. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston). - Sir, I wish to say one word in reply to the Premier about Conciliation Boards. I am very glad indeed to find that the Premier has at last initiated a Unfortunately, he has chosen a time when we can only conceive his idea is to block this motion, though I do not think his remarks about Conciliation Boards ought to be allowed to pass without some comment. It is satisfac- tory to find he is not so enamoured of his political partisans on those Conciliation Boards as he used to be, because nearly all the trouble on the Conciliation Boards is caused by men who are his ardent political partisans-men who are not working for their living. Mr. SEDDON .- They are elected by the unions. Mr. PIRANI .--- The Premier knows why they are elected. He knows how the game is carried out, and the canvassing that goes on. He need only look at the personnel of the Boards, and he will see how the elections are worked. Sir, I say this: It would be well to allow the Con- ciliation Boards to deal only with disputes in which the employers and the employés agree to a reference to the Boards, and in cases in which one party or the other did not agree the case should go to the Arbitration Court. Mr. R. MCKENZIE .- Abolish the Concilia- tion Boards. Mr. PIRANI .- Yes, it is a question whether they should be abolished ; but, at any rate, I am satisfied there should be some alteration in the present system. What is the practice now ? If both parties are not satisfied they must go to the Arbitration Court ; and I would like to ask, who could be satisfied with the decision of a Conciliation Board constituted such as, for in- stance, the Wellington Conciliation Board is ? The Wellington Conciliation Board has never yet settled one dispute in the whole course of its existence. Every dispute that has come before it has gone on to the Arbitration Court. I have been told that the other day one mem- ber of a Board abused several members of a union because, as he said, they were taking a guinea a day out of the mouths of his wife and family. Hon. MEMBERS .- Oh ! Mr. PIRANI .- That is so. I can give you another instance-it happened in Christchurch -in which a question was put by a tanner as to how it would be possible for tanners to carry on their business if they gave the rate of wages asked for, and the answer was, " Well, reduce the price you give to the farmers for their wool- skins." Sir, it would be better, in the interests of arbitration, and also in the interests of con- ciliation, if the whole system were altered by which the temptation to these political parti- sans to live on conciliation were removed altogether. In the first place, let the fee be reduced to 10s. a day instead of a guinea. The Premier said the other day that 10s. a day was sufficient for a member of a Land Board ; and I am sure, if he only gave 10s. a day to members of Conciliation Boards, and at the same time allowed the parties to a dispute to elect their own representatives, and allowed them the option of going to the Arbitration Court direct, he would do away with a great deal of the objection to the system. I hope the House will

sider it is one of the most useful that could be laid before Parliament. Mr. TANNER (Avon) .- Sir, I have no objec- tion to the return being furnished which is the subject of discussion, but I think it is some- what unusual, on the question of the ordering of a return, for the House to discuss at large the whole matter of labour legislation in the way honourable members have done this after- noon. Above all things, I deplore the fact that there is revealed in the House a spirit of covert hostility to the machinery this House a few years ago set up to solve labour disputes. I still further deplore the fact that this hostility is apparently shared by men who assisted to put the Act I refer to on the statute-book. Honourable gentlemen must have voted either mechanically or without thought of what they were doing in 1894, when they passed the Act under which the various tribunals were first set up, which have been so much criticized and so much traduced this afternoon. That Act was distinctly intituled " An Act to en- courage the Formation of Industrial Unions and Associations, and to facilitate the Settlement of Industrial Disputes by Conciliation and Arbitra- tion," and members must have been aware of the fact, unless they voted for the Bill without reading the title. The Act had the effect it was intended it should have. It did encourage the formation of labour and industrial unions and associations. At the time the Act was passed there were not more than about thirty-eight or  forty organized bodies in the colony that were registered under the old Trade Union Act of 1878; but the means provided by this House in its wisdom, and to its credit, to solve the con- tinual disputes that were arising in the industrial world, were such that from that time to the present more than ninety other organizations have come into existence. They have come into existence expressly for the purpose of having their difficulties solved in a simple, expeditious, and easy manner. No doubt the result has been that the Courts which have been set up have been crowded with work. It is possible, Sir, that the Conciliation Boards and the Court have in some cases been manned by men who had had little experience in such matters ; but where, I ask, were we to look for men with ex- perience in the colony, seeing that no such machinery, no such Boards, and no such in- stitution ever existed in the colony pre- viously ? The legislation was an experiment. We were bound to take the men who were considered most suitable for the new work, as the Government does in creating a new depart- ment and making appointments thereto. As time goes on we shall find whether our antici- pations as to the fitness of the instruments selected are correct or otherwise. But to speak of the way in which the Courts are flooded with applications does not necessarily mean that the entire labour world throughout the colony is in the state of ferment that so many honourable gentlemen are anxious to make others believe, but do not themselves believe. They know very well that the bulk of these Mr. Pirani their lives before had a judicial decision with regard to industrial matters, and who are patiently waiting till their turn comes to go \- before the Board or Court, as the case may be. When the case has been heard by the Con- ciliation Board - often, unfortunately, without success -they have the same right to carry the matter to the appellate Court, and that privi- lege belongs also to the employers. And let me say, that not all the cases of appeal to the de- cision of the Arbitration Court have been made by workmen. We had a case in Christchurch only a few weeks ago in which a gentleman ! at the head of the Employers' Association, whose name is known all over the colony in this connection, and who has been president 1 of the Industrial Corporation of New Zealand, stated distinctly that, whatever decision was come to by the Conciliation Board, the matter would be carried to the Court. How, under those circumstances, is it possible to cast the covert blame which is sought to be cast in this House on organized bodies of labour people because so much time is occupied by the Boards ? They 1 are not in all cases the men who are continu- ally appealing to the Arbitration Court. The employers are doing the same thing -- and, by : the way, both parties have equal rights so to do, and I would be sorry to see either party deprived of them. No doubt we get at times decisions perhaps extraordinary and unusual ; but you will get them under every judicial We get them from the Supreme system. Court and from every Magisterial Court in the colony, and in these instances they come from trained men, not from tiros with two or three years' experience of dealing with cases of such difficulty that the House hesitated before set- ting up the machinery for the purpose. I regret the course the debate has taken, and I vigorously protest against the aspersions that have been cast on the men manning the Boards, 1 many of whom are trying honourably and honestly to do their duty, as well as those in the Arbitration Court. Perhaps we cannot all share the same high opinion of these men, but I think this House ought to refrain from casting blame on the gentlemen who have been appointed under legislation, and with the sanction of the House, for this specific task they perform, or strive to perform-the most difficult functions that could be assigned to any men. We ought to give the Act reasonable opportunity of being worked, and watch its operation, before any further criticism is made. Continual disparagement, or tinkering with the 1 Act, is not likely to bring any beneficial result. One word more before I sit down. Honourable gentlemen on that side or on this side of the House can say what they like, or try to put in motion any inimical agitation they choose, but this is the plain fact : We passed the Act under the pressure of the labour people of this colony, and this House will not attempt to retrace what has been done. That Act is on the statute- book, and will have to remain there. If any attempt is made for its removal there are nine- teen thousand people who are members of these 
<page:383>
reason why. Mr. G. J. SMITH (Christchurch City) .- I think, Sir, that the honourable member for Avon has gone a little wide of the mark. I only came in from the library when the debate had made some progress, but from the remarks that have been made since I came into the House there have been no aspersions on the Act itself. As far as the Act is concerned, I was a member of the House when it was passed. I knew what I was doing, and I believed then, as I believe now, that the method proposed was the best way to settle industrial strife. So far as the question of Conciliation Boards is con- cerned, I join issue at once with the honourable member for Avon. I say, if we are going to have industrial disputes, the sooner we get them settled the better in the interests of all parties ; and I infinitely prefer that the disputes should be taken direct to the Arbitration Court. The honourable member for Avon referred to the question of the Conciliation Boards. Well, I will take him back to a case in Canter- bury in a recent dispute. One of the woollen- mills - the Kaiapoi Woollen-mill - was cited before the Board. The Conciliation Board settled the conditions of labour in, I think, thirty eight departments, visited the mill at Kaiapoi, and did it in two days. The Board did not give themselves the time necessary to go into the various questions of the case before them. They are handicapped to this extent : they are not experts, and you cannot get ex- perts in every case. An Hon. MEMBER .- The Board is charged with having wasted time. Mr. G. J. SMITH .- I do not think they take  #cc-zero enough time. They should take time to con- sider matters, with a genuine desire to settle them. I regret that this question has come before the House on this particular motion, but, as I know Mr. Graham, the member for Nelson City, is anxious to have his motion passed, I will say no more at the present time. Mr. ARNOLD (Dunedin City) .- I have only wo or three minutes, but I want to say a good deal in that time. In the first place, I want to say that the member for Palmerston was not correct in stating that the Wellington Con- ciliation Board has not settled any disputes that have been brought before it. If members will look at return No. 7-laid on the table of the Legislative Council -for last year they will find that some cases, at any rate, were settled by the Wellington Board. In addition to those settled, one was partly settled : and one was settled apart from the Board altogether. Mr. PIRANI .- Well, I withdraw the state- ment, and admit that one case was settled. Mr. ARNOLD .- That is not correct either. There was more than one. With regard to these Conciliation Boards, it has been suggested -- and I want to lay emphasis on this one fact -that, while the present Boards are not doing the work that they might be doing, a better system could not be provided by simply pro- viding that a certain number of employers or employés might be elected at the commence- separate disputes occurred the representatives from that trade should deal with it. Let me say this ; that such a plan as that cannot now and never will be acceptable to the Labour party. Simply for this reason : that it has been found over and over again in this colony that the employés cannot meet in conference in the manner suggested with their employers ; and the only manner in which they possibly can have these disputes dealt with fairly is by meeting with those who are not interested in their own callings. Not only do I repeat the statement that was made- The hour of half-past five having arrived, Mr. SPEAKER left the chair. WOODVILLE COUNTY BILL. Mr. SPEAKER resumed the chair at half-past seven o'clock. A message was received from the Legislative Council stating that this Bill had been passed, with an amendment, consisting of a new clause, which was as follows :- "2A. The Woodville, Kumeroa, and Maunga- atua Road Districts are hereby abolished, and shall be deemed to be merged in the Woodville County constituted by this Act, and the pro- visions of section fifty-seven of ' The Counties Act, 1886,' shall apply to these local bodies." Mr. O'MEARA (Pahiatua) moved, That the amendment be agreed to. The alteration in the Bill was the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Palmerston, and that suggestion was now given effect to. In accord- ance with his promise this clause had been in- serted in the Bill in the Legislative Council. Captain RUSSELL (Hawke's Bay) said he did not understand the position, and therefore would not presume to say it was not a wise amendment ; but he knew there was a strong feeling in some parts of the country in favour of retaining the Road Board system, and this entire abolition of three Road Boards seemed to be a very serious alteration to be made by the Council, and brought down to and adopted by the House, probably before the people interested knew anything about it. He was not personally interested in this matter : it was not his con- stituency ; but the position seemed an awkward one they were getting into. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston) said this amend- ment had been suggested in the House, and the honourable member in charge of the Bill, to facilitate its passage, had promised to endeavour to get it inserted in the other Chamber. The question had really been dealt with in 1894, when it had been decided that in all Counties Bills, where small counties were concerned. Parliament would insist upon the other local bodies in the district being merged into the county. Otherwise the passing of these Coun- ties Bills would be almost useless. He felt sure the people in the district would be better satisfied with the Bill in its present state, and that it would be better for them than if there were three Road Boards in the county as well as the County Council, all in operation, which would be the case but for this clause. He 
<page:384>
clause. Mr. O'MEARA (Pahiatua) desired to explain to the honourable member for Hawke's Bay that when the Bill was in Committee he had stated that resolutions had been passed by the three Road Boards agreeing to be merged into the county. Public meetings had also been held in the district, and it had been unani- mously agreed by the people that the district should be formed into a county ; so that they had been consulted by the promoters of the Bill in every way possible. Motion agreed to. SHOPS AND SHOP-ASSISTANTS BILL. IN COMMITTEE. Clause 2 .- "Subsection (a) of section seven and subsection (a) of section eight of ' The Shops and Shop-assistants Act Amendment Act, 1895,' are hereby repealed ; and chemists' shops shall be included in the operation of sec- tion three of 'The Shops and Shop-assistants Act, 1894.' " Mr. McNAB (Mataura) moved to strike out all words down to " operation of." Mr. HUTCHESON (Wellington City) moved, That progress be reported. Motion to report progress negatived. Mr. McNab's amendment agreed to. Mr. McNAB (Mataura) moved, That the following words be added to the clause : "and section seven of 'The Shops and Shop- assistants Act Amendment Act, 1895,' are hereby repealed, and the following enacted in lieu thereof : 'All shops in city, borough, or town district, except those wherein is carried on exclusively one or more of the businesses of a   fishmonger, fruiterer, confectioner, coffee-house keeper, or eating-house keeper, or the keeper of a book-stall on a railway platform, shall be closed in each week on the afternoon of one working-day at the hour of one o'clock. When- ever a public holiday or half-holiday occurs in any week it shall be sufficient compliance with this Act if the shopkeeper closes his shop on such holiday or half-holiday instead of on the closing-day under this Act."" Amendment agreed to, and clause as amended agreed to. Clause 3 .-- " Subsections (two) and (three) of section four of ' The Shops and Shop-assistants Act, 1894,' are hereby re-enacted." Mr. BARCLAY (Dunedin City) moved, that the clause be struck out, with the view of inserting, as a new clause, the words of the section sought to be re-enacted by this section. Motion agreed to, and clause struck out. Clause 4 .- Domestic servants to have weekly half-holiday. Mr. HALL (Waipawa) moved, That progress be reported. The Committee divided. AYES, 23. Fraser, A. L.

Thursday, 15th August, 1901. Library Recess Committee Report-Land for Settle- ments Bill-Shops and Offices Bill. The Hon. the SPEAKER took the chair at half-past two o'clock. PRAYERS. LIBRARY RECESS COMMITTEE REPORT. The Hon. Mr. FELDWICK asked the Chair- man of the Joint Library Committee (Hon. Mr. Rigg), When the report of the Library Recess Committee will be laid on the table of the Council ? He was aware that the honour- able gentleman had just anticipated him by placing the report on the table. However, as he (Mr. Feldwick) had placed the question on the Order Paper, he would ask the question all the same, so as to enable the Chairman of the Library Committee, in reply, to offer any state- ment he might see fit to make. The Hon. Mr. RIGG said the report which he had laid on the table that day was the one referred to in the question of the honourable gentleman. There had been a little delay in the matter so far as the Council was concerned. He understood the report was laid on the table of the other House two days ago. The reason for the delay was simply this : that there had been an oversight on the part of the Librarian. It was only right he should say that that officer had been exceedingly busy since he had received his appointment, had done a great deal of good work, and therefore some allowance must be made for a small oversight of this kind. LAND FOR SETTLEMENTS BILL. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER. - Sir, in moving the third reading of this Bill, I desire to answer a question put to me yesterday by the Hon. Colonel Pitt as regards the operation of the Bill 
<page:385>
informed that the operation of the Bill will be to prevent mortgaging within a period of five years. I read the Bill wrongly myself yester- day, and I am informed that is the effect of the Bill, and it is the intention of the framer. The Hon. Colonel PITT .- That being so, I shall move, by way of amendment, That the Bill be recommitted for the purpose of re- considering clause 11. It was quite evident to me yesterday that what the Minister has now stated was the effect of clause 11, and I can see no other construction which can be put upon it. Then, section 60 of the original Act pro- vides that a person who has a lease under the Act is not allowed to transfer it, or deal with it in any way, within a period of five years, unless upon the recommendation of the Land Board and with the consent of the Minister. Now, it appears to me that is quite a sufficient restriction upon alienation, and quite a suffi- cient protection to prevent any improper aliena- tion of the lease. As I said yesterday upon the second reading, I ask members to con- sider whether they cannot conceive that very great injustice indeed may be done to small settlers by their being prevented from raising money by way of a mortgage upon their lease-holdings. A man may have enough money to stock his land, and to fence it, but he may not have sufficient money to put a house upon it. Very well ; a judicious loan at that time upon the security of his property may make all the difference whether that man is to be a successful man in life or not. Of course, I quite understand that the object of this clause is to prevent dummyism; but, if the Land Board or the Minister thinks there is anything of that nature in the proposed alienation of the lease, it is perfectly competent for the Board or the Minister to say that the lessee shall not be allowed to deal with it. I submit that is ample protection, and I now ask the Council, before they agree to this clause being passed in the form it now stands in, to consider whether they are not attempting to protect the system at the expense of the small settlers. I shall test the feeling of the Council upon the matter, because I think it is a mistake in the policy of the Bill. I move, That the Bill be recommitted for the purpose of reconsidering clause 11. The Hon. Mr. REEVES .- I would point out - and I think I am not mistaken in what I say - that it is provided by the Advances to Settlers Act that any man who has been on his farm for three or four years can get an advance under that Act. That being the case, why should we demand that a man should be five years on his farm before he is capable of getting a loan ? The Hon. Mr. SHRIMSKI .- It is my inten- tion to vote against the amendment, for the reason that it seems to me, if carried, it would be the means of opening the door again to dummyism. If the power is given for money to be advanced upon a man's property as soon as he gets possession of it, it will be opening the door for dummyism, which is the very thing this Bill seeks to prevent. The honour- able gentleman who moved the amendment VOL. CXVII .- 24. have the power of raising money from some source, and it follows that the money-lender, or whoever advances the money, would come into possession of the property shortly afterwards. The Hon. Mr. JONES .- Sir, the Hon. Mr. Shrimski is quite right in what he has stated. The idea of this Act has all along been that those who go on the land should remain there, if they are capable of doing so with benefit to themselves and the colony ; but, unfortunately, there are always evil influences at work. When a man gets on the land he is surrounded by all sorts of counsellors, by money-lenders, and other people of that kind, who exercise every effort to get from him what little he possesses. We should remember that this land is purchased at very great cost by the State, and often the money which was paid for it is, in my opinion, greatly in advance of what should be paid for it, and the settler therefore has to pay a very high rent for his holding. When a person comes before the Board and applies for a section under the Land for Settlements Act he is asked what his financial position is, what prospects he has, what is his capacity to engage in the industry, and what is his knowledge of the cultivation of the soil ; and if he cannot show that there is a reason- able prospect of his succeeding he is rejected as an applicant, or is supposed to be rejected, by the Board. I admit that there are some- times cases in which a man may have but little money ; but he may have knowledge of the industry, and indomitable courage to make up for his lack in this respect. I have even known men who have had no money go on land and pull through successfully, with advantage to themselves and the colony ; but, Sir, these cases are few and far between, and we are not legislating now for isolated cases, but we are legislating, I take it, in order that on broad principles we may really help those who desire to become settlers in this country. There is one thing, however, I should like to see done, and that is: where a man finds, after he has made certain improvements, that he has not quite sufficient money to enable him to remain on his section with advantage to himself and the country, he should be able to go to the Government and ask them for a little help. An Hon. MEMBER. - He can do so. The Hon. Mr. JONES .- The honourable gentleman says, " He can do so " ; but his only recourse is to the Advances to Settlers Department, and, Sir, that department is not under Government control at all. It is worked on strictly business principles. The administrators of the department have no hearts, and they are not supposed to exercise their judgment, save with regard to the financial position. Now, if the Government had power- if the Land Board or the Minister had power -- to make advances to struggling settlers who are deserving of such advances, and who are really in such a position that they can pay the interest and the capital when due, I think it would be a very good thing indeed ; and I believe the time is coming when the Government will make 
<page:386>
tion, because, if the money is advanced to im- prove the property, as the Government are the owners of the property, the State is benefited in every way. I entirely disapprove, as may be conjectured from my remarks, of the ideas pro- pounded by the Hon. Colonel Pitt, because I think it would open the door to speculation. The Hon. Mr. T. KELLY .- I intend to vote against the amendment, for this reason : that this clause 11 which forbids the mortgage, I am informed, only takes effect after the passing of this Act, and does not affect any person who holds a lease now under the principal Act. He can still obtain a mortgage. It simply stops the mortgaging of a lessee's interest who be- comes a lessee after the passing of this Bill ; it stops it for the future ; and, that being so, it is a very good proposal, and really in the interest of the lessee. It is not an advantage to the lessee or the colony to give facilities for borrowing by way of mortgage, for if a person cannot go on land and cultivate it without a mortgage he would be better without it. In the event of financial impossibility to carry on the work of the section, the tenant can surrender under clause 12, and any improvements made by him will be valued, and he will receive the benefit from the incoming tenant. Well, I think that will enable the tenant who is not financially able to hold the land to receive the value of improvements. It is very evident that if a man is financially unable to farm his land properly he has no business to be there, and the sooner he goes and gives place to some one who can pay his way the better, and clause 12 enables him to do so without loss. The Hon. Mr. A. LEE SMITH .- Sir, I think the paramount object of any legislation providing land for the people should be the proper settle- ment of that land-of giving opportunities to those who so desire to settle on the land ; and therefore I consider there should be the greatest care taken to insure that they do stay on the land-that is, a limit of time should be pro- vided within which each person who goes on that land should not part with it, and clause 11 effects this. If you fail to do that you will find a repetition of the many cases which have taken place, I believe, in the past, of specu- lators and dummies taking up land for the express purpose of making a quick profit out of it by sale of their interest in it. Now, the sup- posed severity of this clause, as the Hon. Mr. Shrimski has pointed out, is very much modi- fied by clause 12, which will enable a settler who is in difficulties to go to the Board and represent to them the circumstances of the case. It will then lie in the discretion of the Board whether the circumstances are such as to warrant a breach of this clause 11, and I do not think you can have a better protection for your Bill than to get it in the position which this Bill provides for : that is to say, that there shall be no going in for leasing a section merely for the purpose of speculation ; but in cases where men who are in difficulties, or for some family reason, such as illness, or anything like that, wish to be relieved of their holdings, then Hon. Mr. Jones of getting out of their sections by the means which section 12 provides. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- I would like to point out that dealings with these classes of land acquired under the Land for Settle- ments Act have been specially safeguarded already in many ways. Any one who will turn up the Act passed last year will find that the dealing with this land to individuals is specially hedged round with provisions which absolutely prevent any one going on the land who is not able to cultivate it with advantage to himself and to the State. Special provisions have been made enabling the Land Board to inquire into the circumstances of the applicants, and to see whether they are suitable or not for going on the land, because the blocks of land acquired under the Land for Settlements Act have got to bear their own burdens. It is not intended that they should be either rack-rented on the one hand, or that they should be occupied by tenants who are not able to pay their way, because each estate, as purchased, has got its own burden to carry; and hitherto there has been no default made in any one of them. They have been able to pay their way, and the land, so to speak, has cost nothing to the State. The tenants pay their interest and their sinking fund annually, and at no cost to the State, except the bare fact that the State borrowed the money and was able to acquire the lands. But after that the provisions of the leases have been such as to absolutely take away from the State any liability whatever, excepting the very remote one of the whole country becoming insolvent, which, of course, is a contingency we need not consider. We know very well that these tenants in their early days may have struggles, and may require assistance until events improve : but we have also to consider the difficulty of whether, if too great facilities are given for mortgages, we are not defeating the original intention of the Act. I admit that when I answered the question of the Hon. Colonel Pitt yesterday I was not very clear in my own mind as to what was the intention of the clause referred to. I believed its operation would not be so stringent as it is, and as it is intended to be; but I only beg to assure the Council that it is the deliberate result of experience that it is most desirable to prevent any dealing with these lands by mortgages in the initial years of the lease. It may seem hard in some cases, but still in the long-run it will be found that the State will secure a more permanent class of settler on the land and a more satisfactory kind of close settlement. It is very difficult indeed to confine the advances to be given to settlers only to the Advances to Settlers Board. There might be less objection, perhaps, if the advances were limited only to that Board ; but still at the same time I do not see how it could be done. It would be restricting settlers in their negotiations for financial assistance. In fact, I know that many institutions are willing to meet settlers on very liberal terms now, and I should be sorry to appear to prevent the settlers 
<page:387>
from getting the advantages of the money- market. But still we must all admit that it is very often by means of these borrowings from private individuals that settlers are led into eventual trouble. The borrowings from the Advances to Settlers Office are not so objec- tionable, and never can be, because every year sees a certain portion of the principal repaid, and the settlers' money, which pays the interest and sinking fund, is really reducing the loan each year. The Hon. Mr. JONES .- The difficulty is to get the advances. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- Well, of course, on a leasehold property the advances are limited by the amount of interest the tenant possesses in the lease ; he cannot get advances on anything else. But, of course, he has im- provements he can get advances on, and if he has got a good bit of land at a low rent he has got an additional interest in the lease, which is an interest on which he can raise money. But after discussing the matter with the Minister I have come to the conclusion that he is quite right to endeavour to absolutely prohibit deal- ing with the lands as a matter of mortgage in the early years of the lease. It may seem hard, and it may make it more diffi- cult for struggling settlers to start their new homes when they go on the land; but still it is in their interest in the long-run, inas- much as the Land Board has got so much power in the first instance that before they  accept an applicant they are able to ascertain that they have the knowledge and capabilities to make a good use of the land for which they are applying, and that they also have enough     financial power at their back to enable them to treat the land well. I think there need be no trouble in dealing with land of this kind, because nine men out of every ten who are approved by the Land Board ought to be able to carry on for five years without money. I therefore trust that the honourable member's amendment will be rejected, and that the third reading will be agreed to. The Hon. Mr. TWOMEY .- I shall vote for the amendment of the Hon. Colonel Pitt, not because I am disposed to promote dummyism, but I am disposed to give more time to con- sider the point raised by him. The crowning glory of the land-for-settlements policy in the first years was that men who were almost penniless were settled on the land and made a living on it, and are settled, to my knowledge, there ever since. Now, avowedly, the inten- tion of this clause, and the declared intention of the Minister, is that no such man shall go on the land. I regret that, as to my certain knowledge men who went on the land with very little or nothing are there still, and making a comfortable living, and getting into a position of comparative opulence. An Hon. MEMBER .- With the help of the money-lender. The Hon. Mr. TWOMEY .- Helped by friends, more likely. But even if money-lenders help to put men in a position of comfort and affluence I do not think they can be regarded as enemies. The money-lender is not a great friend in many respects, but if he puts a poor man on the land, and that poor man makes a living and succeeds on it, he is then the friend and benefactor of that man. Why I want this clause postponed and reconsidered is this: I think it can be so framed that the same object will be gained, while at the same time the settler will have the opportunity of borrowing money. Somebody said that there should be a limit. Very well, why not make a limit like this-and I am cer- tain that the Hon. Colonel Pitt will be able to draft a clause that will suit it : Why not put in a clause that would enable the Advances to Settlers Department to make advances to these settlers ? My idea is this: Why not open to the Advances to Settlers Depart- ment the means of advancing to these men if they possess sufficient security ? That is the point. Why not allow the Advances to Settlers Department to advance to them. The land be- longs to the Government, and the money of the Advances to Settlers Department belongs to the Government, and why could not the Government advance on their own land and to their own tenant a little money to enable him to tide over difficulties? That is the ground on which I shall vote, and on which I would ask honour- able gentlemen to reconsider the position- whether it would not be to the advantage of the settler and to the advantage of land-settlement if the Advances to Settlers Department could advance to him a sufficient sum to enable him to tide over a difficulty until he gets on his feet. That is the reason why I will vote with Colonel Pitt, with the view that some clause like that may be drafted, for such a clause would have a better effect on the prevention of dummyism than anything else. If you make it so that only the Advances to Settlers Department can advance, then dummyism is dead, and at the same time the tenant will have a chance of borrowing money to enable him to tide over difficulties. The Hon. Mr. W. KELLY .- I intend to vote for the recommittal of the Bill. I can see no good object to be obtained in preventing a man taking up land from borrowing on his improve- ments. In the district I come from there are numbers of small settlers, and on many occa- sions they have applied to the Advances to Settlers Department for loans on their lease- holds, but to those tenants the department refuse to advance altogether. They have prac- tically boycotted them, and refuse to lend to them on any conditions. Several complaints have been made to the Government in con- sequence of that. My honourable friend Mr. Twomey wants to have this business handed over to the Advances to Settlers Department. My opinion is that if this is done the Advances to Settlers Department will refuse to lend on these small sections. I cannot see why there should be any objection to this Bill being re- committed. It appears to me that we should endeavour, as sensible men, to assist the farmers throughout the colony to get money on the best terms they possibly can; and if those 
<page:388>
tenants can borrow on their improvements, it is our duty to give them every assistance we can to enable them to get the money on the best possible terms. An Hon. MEMBER .- Where can they get the money from ? The Hon. Mr. W. KELLY .- From the people living in the district. They do not need to go to the large cities to get it. There is plenty of money in the districts to lend to the small settlers. I know settlers who have applied to the Advances to Settlers Department and have been refused, and have got the money from people in the district. I intend to support the Hon. Colonel Pitt in his proposition to have this Bill recommitted, so that the clause may be altered ; and I hope honourable gentlemen will think well over it, and give the small settlers an opportunity of getting money on the most reasonable terms. The Hon. Mr. LOUISSON. - I think we should be very careful, and that every restric- tion should be placed in this Act against any trafficking in this land. The principle of obtain- ing land by the Government to sell in small sections is a very good one. and has been found to work admirably in the past; and the Government or Parliament has surrounded the Act with certain safeguards to prevent those people who have obtained the land from parting with it very casily, and I think it is only right that that principle should be continued.  I am not aware, Sir, that there is any alteration of the present law involved in this Bill. Clause 11 seems very drastic at first, but it is con- siderably modified by the second portion of the clause, which provides that "on the death of a lessee, or on the happening of any ex- traordinary event which. in the opinion of the Land Board of the district in which the land is situated, renders a transfer necessary or ex- pedient. a transfer of the lease may, with the sanction of the Board and the Minister of Lands, be made." That leaves a great deal of power in the hands of the Land Board, which up to the present time, I believe. they have used very carefully and very legitimately ; and there is no reason to believe that if any particular circumstances occurred which they thought would entitle the holder of the land to transfer they would put any technical ob- jections in the way. If a lessee, after having been on the land a certain time and having made certain improvements, finds that he is not in a financial position to carry on, he can go to the Land Board, and he can surrender bis lease and get value for his improvements. What can be fairer than that ? It seems to me, Sir, that if a man goes on to a section of land with the idea of his ability in the first instance to carry through, and he finds afterwards that he is not in a position to carry on without going to the money - lenders, I think the very best thing he can do is to surrender his lease, and get a return of the amount he has laid out in mprovements, and let some other man try if he can carry out the lease successfully. In the first instance, the Land Board, I understand, Hon. Mr. W. Kelly takes every precaution to see that the appli- cant is in a fairly good position to carry out the conditions of the lease; and I suppose it would only be in exceptional instances where their opinion will prove erroneous, and the man will not be in a position to carry out the conditions of his lease. But if you relax any of the restrictions which now surround the prin- ciple of the Bill, I think you will open the way to a lot of trafficking in these sections which was never intended when this principle was first adopted in the Acts that are already in force. Then, as regards this Bill itself, there  is nothing in the measure which absolutely prevents a man borrowing money on his lease. It simply says that he shall not transfer his lease. There are many ways of borrowing money on a lease without absolutely trans- ferring the lease. An Hon. MEMBER .- The Government do not want him to transfer his lease. The Hon. Mr. LOUISSON .- Exactly. This clause simply says that he shall not transfer. Unless you are going, in the proposed new clause, to empower the lessee to borrow money, I do not see that it affects this clause any more than any other clause. I think the best policy would be to adhere to the principle upon which these Acts were passed in the first instance. I think the principle was that the holders of these leases should not be allowed to part with them very easily, except through the Land Boards themselves. The machinery has been provided that where a lessee finds himself in difficulties the Land Board may deal with the matter ; they can take over his lease on the most liberal terms-that is, give him full value for his improvements. Now, I will ask honourable members whether the lessee is likely to get such liberal treatment as that from a mortgagee or money-lender. Supposing the lessee borrows, and goes on for another twelve months, and then finds himself in further difficulties, is it at all likely that he would receive the same liberal treatment from the lender of money as is held out to him under the Bill ? I think not, Sir. I think the result would be that he would lose his land and his improvements also. Apart from that, I think. if you once introduce the principle of allowing lessees to deal with leases outside the Land Board, you are simply introducing the principle of trafficking in the land, which was never in- tended. I shall certainly oppose the recom- mittal of the Bill if it is for the purpose of introducing any means of allowing lessees to deal with the leases outside the Land Boards. \- The Council divided on the question, "That the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question."

Taiaroa Baillie Montgomery Twomey Gourley Pitt Scotland Williams. Johnston Kelly, W. Majority for, 9. Amendment negatived, and Bill read the third time. On the question, "That the Bill do pass," The Hon. Colonel PITT said-After the vote which has been taken, I do not propose to delay the passage of the Bill, excepting to say that I am surprised at the arguments which have been used against the recommittal of the Bill in the debate just concluded. In reply to those honourable members who discussed the clause in question and opposed the recommittal, I desire to point out to them that they do not appreciate the position one iota. Section 60 of " The Land for Settlements Act, 1900," says,- " Except on the recommendation of the Land Board and with the approval of the Minister, it shall not be lawful for any lessee to transfer, sublet, or in any way part with, mortgage, or charge his lease, or any portion of his interest therein, until the expiration of the fifth year of the term of his lease." Before the lessee can attempt to mortgage his lease he must have the recommendation of the Board and he must have the approval of the Minister. Now, I would like to ask honour- able members, are they not prepared to trust the Board, and are they not prepared to trust  the Minister ? I am ; and I venture to say that this is ample protection to the lessee in the matter, and ample protection, too, to the State, against what appears to be feared by honourable gentlemen-namely, dummyism. The clause  #cc-zero that has just received the approval of the Council-clause 11-I think will be found to be harsh in its operation, and it will not be many years before Parliament will be called upon to repeal it. Bill passed. SHOPS AND OFFICES BILL. On the question, "That this Bill be com- mitted," The Hon. Mr. SHRIMSKI .- I would ask the Minister to allow the Bill to stand over until some honourable members who have taken a deep interest in the matter have returned. They are now absent, and, as this is one of the most important Bills of the session, I would ask that it be postponed until to morrow. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER. - I do not think it is necessary to postpone this Bill. has been on the Order Paper for two or three days past, and although I extremely regret that any member of the Council should be absent on an occasion of this kind, I do not think the business of the Council should be postponed on account of the absence of any honourable mem- ber. If the debate goes on until a late hour I shall not object to adjourn it, and thus give time to the Hon. Mr. Shrimski to look up his absent forces ; but I cannot do more than that. I have not pressed the matter until the Council ject, and I hope I am not asking too much of the Council in asking it to proceed with the Bill now. The Council is in possession of the evi- dence, and will be able to see what has been brought up this year that is new matter on the subject. I do not think that members will find a great deal of novelty in the evidence. Of course, there is the old rock against which previous labour proposals have had to stand the risk of being wrecked, and that is that people do not like what is new ; but still it is astonishing after a year or two how people get along with what they do not like at first, and I have no doubt that if the Council in its wisdom passes this Bill it will find, five years hence, that the shop-assistants and the office clerks will be only too glad to acknowledge the service the Council and Parliament have done them by securing them payment for over- time. A few years ago Parliament dealt with the question of a weekly half-holiday, and, as far as I remember, every one in business looked upon it as a terrible attack upon the liberties of the subject, and it was generally resisted up and down the country-especially by employers-and even the employés were not quite certain how to take it ; but now you will find that they would sooner give up their Sunday than lose their weekly half-holiday, and I believe the same thing will occur with regard to this Bill. I refer to the payment of overtime, because that really is the only new departure which the Bill contains. Every- thing else in the Bill, excepting the matter of detail, is pretty well affirmed already, and can almost be said to be at the present time an established law or custom. But it has not yet been established that in shops or in offices the services of clerks or shop-assistants, if required after hours, should be paid for at a reasonable rate of overtime. Well, Sir, I must say that I think it is only fair to both sides that there should be a payment for overtime. I am not sure exactly, as regards Parliament, if this Chamber would gain much if it was extended to us, because we, as a rule, do not sit very late ; but I am quite certain that the other Chamber might with advantage have something of the sort applied to them. At the present time the evidence of the witnesses is very instructive, be- cause, apparently, if the witnesses are to be re- lied upon as thoroughly representing the classes they come from, they are perfectly satisfied with the present conditions, which, I must say, as- tonished me, because I have been used in my nightly walks to notice with a considerable It amount of concern that certain establishments kept their lights going very late, and I presumed, of course, that that meant that a certain num- ber of young people were destroying their health. An Hon. MEMBER .- Are you referring to the Government Buildings, or the Government Printing Office ? The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER. - No, we do not do that there; and in the Printing Office they are paid overtime. However, I admit that the evidence, unless you read between the lines, goes to show that the clerks do not want much 
<page:390>
read between the lines, and I do not believe that the evidence, so far as it has come before us, is satisfactory on that point. I do not believe for one minute, if you look at other parts of the evidence, but that what is necessary, both in the interests of employers as well as employed, is that they should be compelled to do their work very much more than they do in office-hours. We have got evidence which tells us that in certain offices, if the clerk and the manager are on good terms, and the clerk wants to get out to a football match, or a cricket match, or a tennis game, or something of that sort, he can always get off on the understanding that he comes back at night and does his work. I say that is not good for anybody. The Hon. Mr. JENNINGS .- There is no harm in that. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- I say there is a great deal of harm in it. That is how half the irregularities in business occur - when a single man gets back to office alone at night. The Hon. Mr. JENNINGS .- Not at all. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- Yes, excuse me; I am only stating what I think. I say that, in my opinion, office-work ought to be done in office-hours, and especially clerks should not be allowed to come back to the office in the evening unless it is absolutely necessary. Therefore I say that, in the interests of all concerned, this sort of free-and-easy business which certain of the evidence indicates points to this fact : that if overtime is required to be paid for it will make both sides very much more businesslike-it will make clerks very particular in claiming payment, and it will also make the employers more chary in getting clerks back in the evening. Of course, the evidence has to be read in many ways. In none of the banks does it appear that over- time is now practised to any serious extent. All classes of employers that gave evidence were almost unanimous in saying, " We do not sin at all in this respect " ; and therefore, if they are as innocent as they claim, this Bill, which refers to these establishments, will not pinch them very hard. There was a certain amount of sentiment brought into the question. They affirmed-and, of course, the Council knows this by the number of petitions laid before it on the subject - that the existing relations are cordial and harmonious in many of the different insti- tutions, mercantile and otherwise. Well, that is as it should be; and I have no doubt that they are. I do not wish for one minute to suggest but what all decent employers are on very good terms with their staff. They try to get the best men they can about them, and when they have got good men they treat them well. I think both sides are to be congratu- lated upon being on such good terms one with the other. But when the clerks tell a Select Committee of this Council, "If you make them pay us overtime you are going to destroy all these harmonious relations which have been built up with years of good under- standing," I, for one, am not such an absolute idiot as to believe any word of that, because a Hon. Mr. W. C. Walker able a business commodity to be questioned, even if the price to be paid for it is a little overtime. Businesses are built up, as all of us know, on a proper understanding between the chief and his staff, and, if the staff is a good staff, he will not mind paying a few shillings a week for overtime ; and certainly he will not wreck the good relations he has built up with very much care between himself and his staff. Therefore I think we may throw to the winds absolutely the absurd contention that one and all of the different institutions that came before us tried to establish-namely, that if this Bill is carried it will absolutely destroy all the har- monious relations existing between these insti- tutions and their employés. My honourable friend on the left has suggested that it is going to reduce salaries. I have been told that in some banks it would be very hard to reduce salaries; they are low enough at the present time. But even then we could not get any bank clerk to tell us whether that was the case or not. The nearest they got to it was that they said a few years ago they were terribly hard-worked; but they would not admit that they were hard-worked now or did too much evening work. Therefore I must ask the Coun- cil to take it absolutely on the ground of com- mon-sense. A certain amount of this evidence must be taken with a great deal of salt ; and from their own knowledge of the circumstances members must judge as to whether it is right or not to pay for overtime. I believe, myself, it is the right thing to do. I believe it will be good for the employer, as I said before, and it will also be good for the employed ; but cer- tainly it must be good for certain offices where, apparently, the work is so light that a clerk can be let out in the afternoon to play a game or take a little diversion, and come back, if he chooses, at night. That cannot be good fer any one ; it is demoralising morally, and I be- lieve also it is demoralising from a commercial point of view. It does not help the offices, and therefore I feel quite certain it will be in the interests of all concerned if such a practice is checked by a Bill of this nature. The Com- mittee, I think, have dealt with the Bill in a very consistent and tolerably fair way. I must say I was out-voted on one question which I do think I ought to have been successful in maintaining. Certainly it was against logic and cool reason that warehouses should be ex- cluded from this Bill. I see no reason why overtime in warehouses should not be paid for, if it is paid in other establishments. It may be quite true that, like Casar's wife, they should be above suspicion ; but also from another play I remember a quotation, " Methinks the lady protests too much." I am sure the latter quo- tation, more than the former, applies to ware- houses, as well as to banks and other institutions of that kind. I shall ask the Council, therefore. to affirm the principle that warehouses, like every other institution, should " toe the mark "" and pay for their overtime if they require it. Of course, they said they did not require it ; they did not overwork their people ; they let 
<page:391>
as they come back when they want them. But still I do not see why, if they should want them back at the time when they ought to be cultivating the domestic virtues at home, they should not pay them for it. It will also be noticed that the Committee has extended the hours of work by enabling the work to begin at half-past six in the morning. I pro- pose to verbally amend clause 2A-that is a new clause which says that all shops shall be closed at six in the evening. That means absolutely that all shops, big and little, are to close at the specified hour. I propose to alter the word to " not later than," so that they can close earlier if they like. We do not want to keep people working too long. There are one or two altera- tions in clause 3. In paragraph (c) we have altered " four " to "five" hours continuous em- ployment, because we found that in large shops, if the maximum was kept at four hours, it would prevent the shop being kept open during the dinner-hour. In order that half the employés may go away whilst the other half keep the shop open, we have altered the hours of employment to five hours. Then, shop-assistants shall not be employed at any time between the hours of six o'clock in the evening and half-past six o'clock in the morning. The reason for that was: we found that in this country butchers particu- larly required to be early at work, but they cannot work later than a certain hour, and they cannot work more than a certain number of hours in the week. Therefore butchers are just as much protected as any one else. I think, Sir, I have touched upon most of the important matters dealt with in this Bill; but really, after all, the new and important question is that overtime is to be universally paid for. That is the real new contention of the Bill. If that contention is right, then I submit there should be no exceptions from it, and that in every case overtime should be paid for. I believe it will be found to be sound in principle and sensible in its operation. I think childish objections have been taken to this question of overtime. Overtime is to be calculated at so-much per hour on the ordinary salary. Well, absolutely some of the witnesses came before us, and as- sured us that because they were paid at so-much per annum it would be derogatory to their sense of professional dignity that this salary should be calculated at so-much per hour. If that is one of the strongest contentions against the proposal there is not much in the contentions. I beg to move, Sir, That you do leave the chair. The Hon. Mr. JENNINGS .- Sir, before the Council goes into Committee on this Bill I have a few words to say in connection with it. I may say that the Labour Bills Committee, to whom this Bill was referred, has paid a great deal of attention to it indeed, and have been sitting for nearly four or five weeks considering it. I can- not agree with what the Hon. the Minister has said with regard to some of the evidence given before that Committee, and I say it is not right - and honourable members will agree with me, if they have read the evidence and followed it carefully-to put before the Council the case saying that they could get out from the bank at any time-it is not right that this should be put before the Council as an argument in favour of the inclusion of bank officials. Other wit- nesses representing bank officials said such was not a general practice. The position, as far as bank officials are concerned, is that, out of a total of 1,003 employed throughout this colony, 967 have signed a petition against being in- cluded in this Bill. I ask honourable members in this Council to realise that bank officials can- not be considered non-intelligent members of the community. They are men well educated, belong to good families, and outwardly do not show signs of being " sweated." Will any one in this Council say that they did not know what they were doing when signing the nume- rous petitions praying that they did not want to come under the operation of this Bill ? The whole position, so far as the warehouse- men and the bank officials are concerned, is this : The warehouseman or the bank official is not placed in the same category as the man who works in a printing-office, or in a boot-factory, or other industry. The work is not so continuous and regular. Their objec- tion with regard to the overtime clauses -- and honourable members will see that the evidence bears out what I am saying-is that they have many advantages given them as a quid pro quo which far outweighs payment for overtime. Why, Sir, one person engaged in a warehouse gave evidence to the effect that an employé had received sick-pay for twelve months while away from business ; and the evidence of warehouse- men right through was that their pay had never been stopped on account of their being away owing to illness ; besides this, they had a fortnight's holiday every year on full pay, and other advantages. Is there any other artisan or mechanic placed in the same position ? I have worked in many places, and, as a rule, my pay has been stopped when I have been away through illness. Sometimes I have struck a good employer, and my pay has gone on ; but, as a general rule, when any mechanic or artisan is away from work through illness or any other cause his wages are deducted. In regard to the bank officials, seeing that they have themselves petitioned against inclusion, is it wise for the Council to include them ? I beg the Council to consider that point. If the representatives of the people in another Cham- ber affirmed the principle of this Bill-and they are more qualified to speak than we are-then it is for us to adopt it after careful revision. I say that this Council may place itself in a wrong position by going against the expressed convictions of these witnesses, who, I claim, before the Labour Bills Committee, fairly re- presented the opinions of warehousemen and bank officials throughout the colony. Yet, notwithstanding that fact, the Minister has asked the Council to include them ; and even goes further, for, though the Committee struck out warehousemen, he will ask the Council to make them "toe the mark" too. Sir, I am appalled at such a state of affairs as this.

Hon. MEMBERS .- Oh ! The Hon. Mr. JENNINGS .- Yes, I am- honestly. I would rather retire from political life to-morrow than make myself one of a party who wish to force down the throats of people what they do not want. I say it is not right. If a printers' union or a carpenters' union make representations to the honourable gentle- man, or to the Labour Department, those representations are very properly listened to. Now, in the face of the numbers of persons affected by this Bill saying that they do not want it. I ask, is it right or wise to thrust it upon them ? I say this Bill should have come from the other Chamber, and this Council may find itself in a false position if it is going to include in the Bill those clauses which the people concerned object to. I would rather the department had brought down a Bill similar to the South Australian Shop-hours Act. That Act has worked fairly satisfactorily, and I believe it would suit the peculiarities of this colony. Again, why not allow shopkeepers and those employed in offices to adopt the local option principle ? It has been adopted through- out the colony in regard to shopkeepers fixing the day for the half-holiday. The municipal authorities call a meeting of those interested for the purpose of deciding what day will suit the majority. Why should not that option principle be extended a bit further ? I would give power to those affected by this Bill to meet in a similar manner, and would say, "Meet amongst yourselves and decide as to the  hours you are going to close, and so forth, and arrange what would suit the majority." It is not right in these smaller matters to be con- tinually having one portion of the people at loggerheads with the other, and thus causing irritation. I have received innumerable letters objecting to certain provisions in this Bill. There is one, for instance, from a number of chemists objecting to being included. I think it would be better to put off the Bill for another six months, so that further consideration may be given to the new provisions of the measure ; and if any honourable gentleman is prepared to move in that direction I shall be prepared to support him. The Hon. Mr. A. LEE SMITH .- As one who has been intrusted with something like a hundred and fifty petitions from members of the staffs of various banks in the colony, I feel that I ought to make some remarks upon the question of the application of this Bill to such institutions. I am very sorry to see that proper consideration has not been given to the representations of these gentle- men. Deputations representing the whole of the banks in Wellington waited upon the Labour Bills Committee, and those gentlemen pointed out the great difficulties which would arise from the operation of this Bill. Now, I will give some of my own observations. I regard the staff of a bank as altogether on a different footing from that on which the staff of a warehouse or any other similar institution stands. First of all, let us look at it in this way: Supposing you provide that the officers must leave the bank within half an hour of the ordinary time of closing on Saturday, or on other days, and a large quantity of money has been paid in in the way of country cheques, or cheques from places at a distance-we know that it is necessary according to law to get those cheques away that night for clearance by the country banks-then if you only allow the officers half an hour in which to do the work the thing would be absolutely impossible. Then, take the 4th of the month, or the 20th of the month : it is usual for merchants to make their bills payable on the 4th or the 20th of the month - mostly on the 4th. An enormous amount of additional work has therefore to be done on those two days, and if the officers were only to work during the hours now proposed it would mean that a very much larger staff would have to be engaged. The staff of these institutions is regulated according to the usual business transacted, and if on the 4th of the month you closed the bank at one o'clock or five o'clock, as the case may be, the officers would have no possible chance of getting through with their work. They necessarily have to work longer on those days. The only consideration you can give to them is to allow them overtime. That is a very small matter compared with the great necessity there is for these great institutions being able to carry on their work properly, for there is no possible chance of their putting off their work, as in the case of an ordinary mercantile house or warehouse-the work in 1 which houses may sometimes be put off till next day. Therefore, the application of this Bill to the banks will result in their having to employ very much larger staffs to cope with this extra work only, or else the work will be badly done, and great mistakes may occur. I quite agree with what the Hon. Mr. Jennings has said-that the Council ought to give con- sideration to the representations of the peti- tioners. My sympathies are with those who have been overworked in the past, and there is no doubt that the staffs of banks have been worked very much longer than they ought to have been worked. There is no doubt about that ; but the thing is quite different now. I believe those institutions have taken warning from remarks made in this Council, and the warning held over them on the introduction of this Bill last year, and therefore they have altered their ways. I think the Council would do well to give much consideration to the pro- visions of this Bill, and to pause before it imposes on these institutions a system which 1 I am quite certain will be unworkable. The Hon. Mr. BOLT. - There was one matter which came before the Committee, and as to which evidence was taken, and that was: it was shown that the conditions of labour in both warehouses and banks had improved very much With during the past two or three years. regard to warehouses, if honourable members will look at the evidence they will see that there is uniform testimony as to the friendly feelings and the good conditions which exist in ware- houses at the present time. Wherever there is 
<page:393>
an exception to that rule it was shown to exist in warehouses which carry on partly wholesale and partly retail trade ; but as to bona fide wholesale dealers there was no departure from the testimony I have alluded to. With regard to the offices and banks, this Bill does not provide anything which is not now the law. As a matter of fact, the whole of the provisions of the Bill as they affect banks are now included in the existing law, with the exception of clause 25, and new clause 22A, which reads,- " Payment of wages or salaries shall be made in full at weekly or other intervals as agreed on, being in no case longer than fortnightly inter- vals." The other new matter affecting banks is found in clause 25, which is a new provision put in by the Committee. Clause 25 pro- vides,- " (1.) The occupier of an office shall at all times keep a record-book, called the ' Extra- time Book,' wherein shall be entered a cor- rect record showing, in the case of each office- assistant who is employed under the last pre- ceding section, the name of the assistant, and the respective dates, periods, and purposes of such employment. "(2.) The extra-time book shall at all times be open to the inspection of the office-assistants and of the Inspector. " (3.) The Inspector may at any time require the occupier to verify the entries in the extra- time book by statutory declaration in such  form as may be prescribed by regulations." With the exception of these two clauses, the whole of the provisions of the Bill are now law, and have been law for some time. I am satis-     fied, however, as some honourable members have already stated, that the introduction of this Bill, and the discussion which has taken place on it, more especially as it affects those working in offices, will have a beneficial effect ; and therefore I would have no objection to striking out the whole of the clauses with re- gard to banks, with the exception of the clause rendering it necessary for employers to keep an " extra-time book," which should be retained. I think it is a proper thing that a book such as is provided for in the clause should be kept, not only in banks, but in warehouses also. The Labour Bills Committee were of that opinion, and they kept the clause in, so that by-and-by it could be seen to what extent extra hours are worked in these institutions. There is one point I wish to correct the Minister on, and that is when he made the statement that this system of clerks getting away on an afternoon and going back at night to make up for the time so lost was in vogue in the warehouses. As a matter of fact, no warehouse allows it, and it did not come out in evidence that such was the case in connection with the warehouses, but that it was the case in connection with the banks; and I look upon it as being a very im- proper course of conduct to take place in con- nection with any institution. I think that the clerks and others who have to conduct the business of such institutions should do so within the ordinary working-hours. To do otherwise leads to laxity of life and unsteadi- ness of conduct. You cannot allow young fellows to loiter about the streets during the time they should be at work, and then permit them to go back at night to make up for it, without undermining their perseverance and sense of the responsibilities of life's duties. I do not know that I need say anything more with regard to warehouses. I have heard it has been lately noticed that warehouses have been work- ing late. I am very glad that that statement came to my notice, because I can offer some explana- tion of it. There are two seasons in the year, and only two, in which the warehouses have to work late. That is on the 1st August and the 1st February. During the months of January and July the stock-stocking is going on, and at the end of the stock-taking -which is at the end of those months-the new season's shipments come to hand, and they have to be opened up at once. That duplicates the work of the warehouses for about a fortnight; in each of these two half-years the work is no doubt very heavy and the hours long, but, with the exception of those two seasons, there are no late hours to speak of. In connection with this, I made it my business to call on the store- man of Bing, Harris, and Co., and I asked him what number of hours he had had to work in the way of overtime during the last twelve months; and after carefully considering the matter he said he was certain he had not worked fifty hours' overtime during the whole twelve months ; and that, of course, includes the two busy seasons I have just referred to. I therefore think there is not the slightest ne- cessity for keeping warehouses in the Bill; and, if unnecessary, why have them in it? If we look around we shall see that this is certainly a very inopportune time to introduce legisla- tion having an irritating or vexatious tendency. We should, I think, rather do the reverse. I may say, if the Council thinks it desirable to strike out all the clauses relating to offices, as has been done by the Labour Bills Com- mittee with regard to warehouses, I shall have no objections, and shall vote for this to be done, provided that the clause enacting that the extra-time book shall be kept is retained. I think that would be a very proper check on the overtime system, as I believe the system hitherto in vogue in banks of allowing their young men to get away for two or three hours in the daytime should be stopped whenever it involves night-work. The Hon. Mr. PINKERTON .- I had not the opportunity of being present at the last two meetings of the Labour Bills Committee. I have attended as regularly as possible-and I endeavour to attend Committees as far as I can -but I have read the evidence given before the Committee on this Bill, and, in my opinion, the Bill is not wanted at all. I do not know what the Bill is brought down for. We are told that the relations existing between employers and emploved in the cases of banks, warehouses, and offices are of such a nature that they desire to be left alone : and, if they desire to be left alone, why should we interfere with them by 
<page:394>
consider to be beneficent conditions-benefits that they do not want ? They have told us that they do not want them. The Minister says that we must read within the lines. I say that we have a right to read the evidence, but cer- tainly no evidence has come before us to war- rant us passing such a Bill as this. It has been said already by the Hon. Mr. Lee Smith that he presented a number of petitions against the proposed operation of this Bill, wherein the petitioners asked for relief from the operation of the Bill. I have also presented a number of petitions-not so many as the honourable gentleman-but in every instance these peti- tions were signed largely by the employés, who prayed to be left alone ; they stated that they were very well contented with the present con- ditions, and said, " Leave us alone." As a very old trade-unionist, and one who has taken a lively interest in all measures for the ameliora- tion of the workers, I have always done my level best to procure what benefits I could for all concerned-in fact, I have made it the one rule that any union desiring to be affiliated with a central body, and to obtain the benefits of that central body, should be manly and straightforward enough to say what they wanted. I think the bank clerks and the officers in warehouses are manly enough and firm enough to say what they want. They have done so; and they have told us in their petitions that they want to be left alone ; and if they want to be left alone, and are manly enough to adhere to that request, I think this Council should leave them alone. Why should we endeavour to destroy the relations now existing between the employers and employés so long as both parties are satisfied? If one party represented to us that they were not satisfied, then I, for one, would stretch a point to relieve them from the disabilities they were suffering under; but, as I have said, surely these men know best what they want, and it is not for us to say what they want. We must read the evidence, and go upon the evidence which is put before us. In respect to some cases we may have different information, but reading between the lines it does not appear that there are conditions existing in this par- ticular branch of employment that should not exist. I have heard, and I dare say other honourable members have heard, some com- plaints that have come to them from clerks in offices; but those men have never come for- ward or formulated their complaints in any way, and, as they have said what they wanted, I think it is wrong for us to endeavour to force any conditions on them, or to seek to alter their conditions from what they are at present. I do not see what the Bill is wanted for. I shall not oppose it going into Committee, but there are certain clauses which very likely I shall oppose. With regard to warehouses, I cannot imagine why warehouses should be exempted and other institutions kept in. On going round the town, as most of us do in the evening, we often see lighted windows in warehouses until a very late hour. I was in Hon. Mr. Pinkerton streets at night just to see where the lights. were, and I saw a great many lights in the windows of the warehouses, not only in the offices, but also in the other departments of the warehouses. I could name some of them, but I suppose that would not be fair ; and I say that, if the warehouses are to be struck out, surely the banks should be struck out also. The Shops and Shop-assistants Act is working very well, and I think we are going to do a great deal of mischief to our workers by agi- tating in the way we are doing, and stretching the Act to an extent that was never intended, unless we can show some good cause for it. The Hon. Mr. LOUISSON. - Sir, I must confess I do not like this Bill at all, and my dislike to it has been very much strengthened by the opinions of people I have spoken to. Nearly every person you converse with in con- nection with politics at all will tell you how very much he dislikes this particular Bill, and how unnecessary he thinks it is. There seems to be a general consensus of opinion outside Parliament that this Bill is not required, that things are working very well at the present time, and that there is an excellent feeling between employers and employés, and that it would be injudicious to have any further en- actments which are likely to destroy these rela- tions. Now, with regard to the petitions that have been presented from time to time to this Council against this Bill, the figures given by my honourable friend Mr. Jennings are most extraordinary. He tells us that out of 1,003 bank clerks in the colony, 967 have petitioned against this Bill. Why, Sir, we may say that it is a unanimous vote of the whole staff of the bank officials of this colony. I believe the present policy of the Government, and the policy of all well-wishers of the country. is "Trust the people." Well, here, in round numbers, are a thousand officials-the whole of them -- who tell us exactly what they want ; and are we to turn round and say, "No, we will not trust you. You do not know what you want. We know what you want better than you do." Now, Sir, I could understand that position if there was no unanimity amongst these officials-if there was a small majority of them against the Bill. But I take these figures to mean an absolutely unanimous vote and ex- pression of opinion of the whole of the bank clerks of the colony. Out of all the bank clerks and officials in the colony there are thirty-six who did not sign these petitions, and we may reasonably take it for granted that these thirty- six were either away or incapacitated from signing. At any rate, if it was absolutely necessary to get a unanimous opinion from any section of the people on a particular subject, I do not think you could go very much nearer than you have done here. where you have a vote of 967 out of 1,003. That same argument, I think, refers to the warehouses, because al- though the petitions have not come in so nume- rously from these persons, still, I believe they are practically unanimous. I really think it would be unwise to force legislation of this. 
<page:395>
candidly that they do not want it, and that they are very well satisfied with the present condi- tions. I think legislation is intended to im- prove the present condition of the people, or any particular class of the people ; it is not intended to legislate in a direction which the people interested say they do not require for their benefit, but which we in our superior wisdom think they do require. I think it is quite time to initiate legislation on these particular subjects as soon as we find that there is something very wrong in the arrange- ments between employers and employés. If there are any great hardships existing, now is the time we should hear of them. There has been a great deal of agitation outside about this particular Bill, and a great deal of discussion, and I think if there were any hardships that require to be remedied, now is the time they would have come to the knowledge of this House ; and, although I do not propose to move any resolution on the subject, I should certainly like to see the Bill withdrawn for the present, until it was apparent there was a great neces- sity for legislation in that direction. The Hon. Mr. JENKINSON .- I am afraid there is a very great deal of misapprehension about this Bill, because it is to a great extent only a consolidating measure. There is not a great deal of new material in it, and, con- sidering we have had it before the Council on previous occasions-last year, and the session before that, I think, it was before the Council-  it appears to me that honourable members have not read the Bill, and have not studied what is the present law. The Hon. Mr. PINKERTON. - Why alter   the present law ; it is working well enough ? The Hon. Mr. JENKINSON .- It is well to consolidate the law in some cases. The Hon. Mr. PINKERTON .- We have no objection to consolidation; it is the new matter. The Hon. Mr. JENKINSON .- Not only do members of the Council seem to be ignorant of the provisions of the law, but a certain number of witnesses who came before the Labour Bills Committee took the greatest exception to what had already been the law for years. The Hon. Mr. A. LEE SMITH. - It is broken almost every day in the banks. The Hon. Mr. JENKINSON .- Oh, I think not. I do not know that it is necessary to break the law ; the law is sufficiently elastic in the matter of banks closing to allow sufficient latitude, and there is, therefore, no occasion for breaches. Now, the greatest exception was taken by some people who gave evidence to this provision : that to close banks and offices at five o'clock on five days a week and twelve o'clock on Saturday. They said it would be a very hard provision if this was enacted, and that they did not want it at all, and that it was going to disturb the harmonious relations existing between employers and workers, which have been referred to several times during this debate -this provision which has been the law for six years, and which is to be re-enacted and put knowledge affected them. Now, that is just on a par with the misapprehension that a great number of the members of this Council seem to have regarding this Bill. An Hon. MEMBER .- There are too many black lines in the Bill. The Hon. Mr. JENKINSON .- I admit there is a certain number of black lines in the Bill. A good number of these good amendments were made in the Committee, and I think the Bill as it has emerged from the Labour Bills. Committee is a most comprehensive mea- sure, and a measure that, as the Minister of Education said, will a few years hence cause. shopkeepers and shop-assistants and clerks to rise, not in their wrath, but in gladness,. and to bless us. I want to point out just one or two of the new provisions of this Bill. The Hon. the Minister, I think, said that one of the chief proposals, and one of the most drastic proposals, was the payment for over- time. Now, Sir, I think the most drastic pro- posal in this Bill is the attempt to curtail the hours of adult labour. I think this is the first time that Parliament has ever touched on the matter of curtailing the hours of adult labour. We hear reports that Eight Hours Bills are coming forward-in shoals almost-in another place, and I am not sure but what an Eight Hours Bill did not at one time get through one House of the Legislature. However, this is the first time any Legislature has made any decided attempt to curtail the hours of adult labour, and as to whether it is wise or not I am not exactly sure ; so much so that J intend to vote against the clauses curtailing the hours in banks and warehouses. I think any overtime worked should be paid for, but whether we should curtail the hours of office and bank clerks I am not at all sure about at present. If we were going to have a compre- hensive Eight Hours Bill, meting out eight hours for all and sundry, then, I think, would be the time to enact this provision ; but to bring it into this Bill, and say that shop- assistants and bank clerks shall not work more than a certain number of hours a week-rather more than eight hours a day, fifty-two hours per week-and shall not be allowed to work overtime beyond some three hours a day upon thirty days in a year, be that overtime paid for or not, and allow a labourer or artisan to work much longer hours-that is a proposal that requires very great consideration ; and I think what has happened in the Conciliation Boards and through the decisions of the Arbitration Court will bear me out in what I am saying, that the workmen of the colony are not ripe for such a proposal. I do not know that in any case that has come before the Conciliation Board the overtime has been entirely stopped, nor has it been asked for by any union. They fix a certain graduated payment for overtime ; but I do not think they ever curtailed the number of hours and said that forty-four, forty- five, or forty-eight hours should constitute a week's work, and that the men must be abso- lutely debarred from working overtime. And I. 
<page:396>
regard to shop-assistants any different. That is the most drastic proposal we have in this Bill-the fact that we, for the first time, inter- fere with the hours of adult labour. There is another new phase in this Bill-that which gives hotel-servants a half-holiday. That is a very good thing, and I do not think there should be any difficulty in getting that. I hope that portion of the Bill will become law, and that the hotel-servants will have a half-holiday every week. An Hon. MEMBER .- They get more than that now. The Hon. Mr. JENKINSON .- That is the honourable gentleman's opinion, of course, and perhaps his servants do ; but we have the evi- dence of a good number of witnesses, and we have our own opinions about it, which tell us that the honourable member is quite wrong as regards the usual rule. Then, we have another proposal that payments of wages and salaries should be made weekly, and in no case longer than fortnightly. A few sessions ago we passed a Bill called the " Limitation of Imprisonment for Debt Bill," and in consequence of that the fact has been brought home pretty forcibly to traders that monthly payments go a long way towards encouraging credit and keeping it up. I think that one and all of the traders who came before us, and I think every trader you may ask on the matter, will tell you that the payment of monthly salaries prompts and en- courages credit ; and I think if you enact in this Bill that all shop-assistants, and all bank clerks, and all warehouse assistants-and Go- vernment officers too-shall be paid weekly or fortnightly, you would do a great deal to   eradicate this credit system that is in vogue at present. Then, there is another phase in this Bill by which we are interfering with adult labour in a way that I do not think we should do, and that is that payment for the half-holiday shall be enacted. It is quite true that, generally speaking, the half-holiday is paid for in the same way now as the other holi. days are paid for. and all shop-assistants get paid for their half-holiday and for the other holidays ; but in this Bill, as it came to the Council, it was provided that it should be enacted by law that they should be paid for the half-holiday. I do not know that we should go so far as to affirm that. I think if anything will tend to disturb friendly relations between man and master this would, and in some instances it might act harshly on the employer, and we ought to consider the employer as well as the employé. I shall vote against stating by Act that holidays must be paid for. There are several holidays mentioned in the Bill for guidance in reference to the statutory half- holiday. It also says that wherever the Go. vernment think fit to proclaim a holiday such holiday may also be taken as a guide for the half holiday. Now, Sir, a clause has been put in by the Committee that those holidays shall be paid for. As a matter of fact, they are paid for already; but I am altogether opposed to its being laid down in the Bill Hon. Mr. Jenkinson may seem inconsistent on my part, but I can- not help that, and I will oppose that clause when it comes up. If it passes into law we must also enact that these holidays are to be strictly observed, or else the employer will in some cases compel his assistants to work on these days, and so far the law will not prevent him doing so. There is another proposal which, so far, is not in the Bill, but which I would like to see and will try to get in the Bill, and that is that it shall apply to Government offices. That is the only point I wanted in the Bill to make it acceptable to the whole community, and I hope all honourable members will vote for that clause going in. I am not quite sure that the Minister did not have those very Govern- ment buildings in his mind's eye when he talked about some buildings in town being lit up almost every night. Whether that is the case or not, it is a fact that those buildings are lit up almost every night. Members will bear me out in saying the Government are the greatest sinners in this respect. And it is not the under- paid clerks who suffer in this matter. It is the higher-paid officers. An Hon. MEMBER. -- The overpaid officers. The Hon. Mr. JENKINSON .- No, not the overpaid officers. I do not think there are any overpaid Government officers, nor overpaid members either. Almost every night you will find a light in the office of the heads of the de- partments up till two or three in the morning. An Hon. MEMBER .- During the session. The Hon. Mr. JENKINSON. - And during the recess too. All we want is to get this grand proposal of mine in the Bill and I am sure the Bill will pass both Houses without trouble. If honourable members will study the effect of this Bill I think they will find that it will do a great deal to bring about uniformity-at any rate, in the hours of employment-and so pre- vent the great amount of time that is spent by the Conciliation Boards in dealing with the ques- tion of hours of employment. I am quite sure that if this Bill passes, and also other Bills in the same direction for making the hours of labour uniform, it will go a long way towards keeping a number of cases from the Boards and from the Arbitration Court. The question of wages I do not know that we can deal with in the Legislature, but the question of hours can be laid down, and not be a sore and constantly recurring point of dispute to masters and men. There is a good deal to talk about in the Bill if one went through it : but I am quite sure that if this debate is held over till to-morrow, and honourable members take the Bill home and read it carefully, they will find that there is not much new matter in it. I think they will find that the Labour Bills Committee dealt with the Bill as they have dealt with the warehouses-namely, on pretty fair and reason- able lines, with the exception that the Govern. ment offices should be included. As I said before, the antagonism to the Bill simply arises from the fact that a great number of the mem- bers do not know that the bulk of the Bill is already law. 
<page:397>
The Hon. Mr. SHRIMSKI .- No doubt the honourable gentleman who has just sat down has some personal experience of this matter, because he is a member of the Labour Bills Committee, and consequently he is in a better position to argue points with reference to this measure than a number of other honourable members. I may say that I think this Bill, as it is a consolidation Bill, should have been intro- duced into the other Chamber and then have been sent to this Council as the revising Cham- ber. Instead of that being done, the Bill has been introduced into the Council and the other House is the revising Chamber. I entirely dis- approve of that. Had it been an ordinary Bill it would have been a different matter, but as it is a consolidation measure I think it should have been introduced into the other Chamber and then have come up here for revision. It has been very gratifying and pleasant to me to hear the speeches of certain honourable gentlemen this afternoon. I refer particularly to the speeches of the Hon. Mr. Bolt, the Hon. Mr. Jennings, the Hon. Mr. Pinkerton, the Hon. Mr. Jenkinson, and one or two others. Sir. I was surprised to see the conversion of some of those honourable members, and their advocacy of the bankers, merchants, wholesale houses, and the employés in wholesale houses. It is interesting to compare the position they have taken up to-day with that taken up by them in the past. I have no objection to including banks, nor do I wish to see ware-  housemen excluded. But what struck me more particularly was the interest which those honourable gentlemen took in these lofty in- stitutions. An Hon. MEMBER .- Hundreds of petitions.   The Hon. Mr. SHRIMSKI .- I will come to the petitions directly. It is because those in- stitutions are wealthy and have means at their command, and can afford to send petitions and influence those honourable gentlemen to advo- cate their interests ; but not a solitary member has stood up in defence of the interests of those who will mostly be injured by this Bill. Read clause 2A. What do we find there ? That every shop is to be closed at six o'clock in the even- ing. What about the poor unfortunate man who, in his humble way, keeps a little bit of a shop, and who only gets any business after the larger houses are closed? Not one of those gentlemen, who have in the past taken such an interest in the poor people of this country have spoken on behalf of these people on this occasion. I am opposed to this Bill. as I have always been opposed to our labour legislation and to any interference with the privileges and liberties of the people. I do not believe in it. Some honourable gentlemen have said that we are going rather far, and that we might run the ship ashore-that the result will be to cause strong feeling against this legislation. Well, I believe the day is not far distant when we shall see a revulsion of feeling against what has been taking place. For some time past it has constantly been boasted that this country is prospering; but there is no doubt there are rocks ahead, and that before long this legis- lation instead of benefiting the working-man will be doing him an injury. We must remem- ber that what we do does not only affect the present generation, but it also affects those who are growing up, and our legislation may have the effect of preventing many of them getting employment. The Minister said that officers in banks and warehouses should be paid over- time. There is no doubt that such a thing may take place, but it will certainly be at the cost of a reduction of the salaries of these officers, because I believe that there are large numbers of clerks and assistants in warehouses who desire work. I say that any one advertising now for a confidential clerk will to-morrow morning have hundreds of men at his doors wanting the position. There are plenty of them to choose from, and consequently if overtime is paid it will come out of the general wages. As I have stated before, whatever you do to restrict trade means placing heavy burdens upon the \- masses of the people, because they have to pay for it. It is the consumer who has to pay for these things, and the consumer means the mass of the people. I shall oppose this Bill. Debate adjourned.

Mr. SEDDON (Premier) asked that Ministers be relieved from answering questions to-day. Captain RUSSELL (Hawke's Bay) asked the Premier when members would be placed in possession of the paper B .- 1, and particulars regarding unauthorised expenditure, and also when the customary quarterly returns, up to 30th June, which should be published in the Giazette, would be available. He hoped that these would be at the disposal of honourable + members, so that they might be the better able to understand the tables of the Financial State- ment. Mr. SEDDON thought members would give the Government that credit to which they were entitled for the manner in which they had supplied returns this year. There was scarcely a return desired by honourable members that had not been agreed to. Mr. MASSEY .- We have not seen them yet. 
<page:398>
Mr. SEDDON said the Government was not going to put an army of clerks on to that work. It would be unfair to saddle the colony with that enormous additional expense. Captain RUSSELL .- I am only asking for those that are authorised by law. Mr. SEDDON said they had extra clerks engaged preparing returns for the House, but some of the returns that had been asked for would cost a tremendous amount of money, and it was unreasonable to expect the Govern- ment to incur that extra expense. As regards returns that had to be supplied according to Act of Parliament, he thought the Government had fairly complied with the law. Hon. MEMBERS .- No, no ; you have not. Mr. SEDDON said it would be impossible for him to supply anything that would satisfy honourable members on the Opposition benches -- it was intended that it should be so. With regard to the Financial Statement, he could assure them that he mtended to make it as clear as possible, but if after they got it any further information was required to make it plainer, he would do his best to meet the wishes of honourable members. He thought honourable members would like to have the B .- 1 paper; but he could not do impossibilities. He had known sessions pass by without it being given at all. The un- authorised expenditure must, of course, be given. Captain RUSSELL .- When are we to get it ? Mr. SEDDON said honourable members would get it before the financial debate took place. He wanted to push on the business of the country, and he believed that by giving what information he could it would facilitate He would meet the wishes of business. honourable members in the matter as far as he could. # PUBLIC HEALTH BILL. Interrupted debate on the question, "That the amendments of the Legislative Council be agreed to." Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) said he was speak- ing when the debate was interrupted. On that occasion he was not speaking on the amend- ments themselves, but he was protesting that members were being asked to agree to amend- ments that they had not seen, and there- fore could not understand, and he suggested that the amendments should be printed. Since then that had been done, and he found that two important amendments had been made. According to new subclause (2) goods imported contrary to the provisions of Orders in Council, and which in the opinion of some official might be likely to convey infectious diseases, might be dealt with under "The Customs Laws Consolidation Act. 1882"-that was to say, that they might be destroyed or otherwise disposed of at the option of the Minister in charge of that department. The other clause was even more important. It referred to the vaccination clauses in the Public Health Act, under which, he believed. persons who objected to compulsory vaccination might have exemptions granted them by a Stipendiary Magistrate, or & Registrar of Births, Deaths, and Marriages; but according to the new amendment "Registrar" was struck out, and people would have to go to the Magistrate- probably in the open Court. The arrangement would, in his opinion, not be nearly so con- venient, for while many people objected to going before a Magistrate, there was no such objection to going to a Registrar. He did not feel very strongly about either amendment, but there were members in the House who held strong opinions on the vaccination question ; and the importance of these amendments justi- fied their contention that the House should not agree to amendments made in another place without having them printed and circulated, so that they might be thoroughly understood. Mr. FOWLDS (Auckland City) said he de- sired to enter his protest against the alteration with regard to vaccination. He did not think that the door should be narrowed to get the exemptions. It was the opinion of many medi- cal men that vaccination was not merely use- less, but exceedingly dangerous. The alterations meant that no one could get an exemption ex- cept from a Magistrate, while formerly the order could be signed by a Registrar of Births, Deaths, and Marriages, or by a Magistrate. He thought the proposed limitation was altogether wrong, and he would vote against it. Mr. COLLINS (Christchurch City) wished to add his protest against this alteration being made. He thought it infinitely better that the law should remain as it was than that people should have to get an exemption from a Magis- trate. As had been pointed out, many people who would strongly object to having to apply to a Magistrate would not object to applying to a Registrar. This was a matter of very con- siderable importance, and had given rise to a great deal of agitation in almost every part of the world. There was a difference of opinion regarding it, and a great deal of medical evi- dence could be produced in favour of both sides. He felt sure it would be far better to leave the law as it was at present. Mr. HALL ( Waipawa) had very much pleasure in supporting what other members had said. In this matter we were far behind the English law, where no difficulties were put in the way of parents who desired to have their children exempted from vaccination. Those who were opposed to vaccination were supported by a large amount of medical testimony. There were many cases in which vaccination had been the means of producing in children disease that remained with them throughout the whole of their lives. If people were against vaccination, if they had conscientious objections to it, those objections ought to be given effect to without the people being dragged before a Magistrate and questioned, probably by a gentleman who was prejudiced very strongly in favour of vac- cination. He had therefore great pleasure in supporting what previous speakers had said upon this subject. Mr. R. THOMPSON (Marsden) also wished to lodge his protest against the amendment, 
<page:399>
and hoped the Minister would not accept it. He knew there was a very strong feeling amongst country settlers on the question of vaccination. There were many country dis- tricts that were not visited by a Magistrate, or only once in every three months, and he did not think they ought to put people to the trouble of travelling twenty or thirty miles in order to meet a Magistrate to get exemption. So far as he knew the feelings of the country settlers, they would resent this alteration of the law. refuse to comply with it, and nothing but trouble would be caused throughout the coun- try. It would, he considered, be better for the House to put down its foot and refuse to accept this amendment, leaving the law as at present. If the House did not do that it would only create a great deal of trouble. Mr. FLATMAN (Geraldine) also wished, on behalf of the country districts, to enter the same protest as the last speaker. It would be very inconvenient in many cases for people who wished to have exemption to go to a Stipendiary Magistrate. The last speaker had expressed his opinion upon the matter, but he considered it right to rise in order to indorse what had been said. He trusted the House would not accept the amendment. Mr. LAURENSON (Lyttelton) desired to join in the chorus that had been raised in protest against the alteration of the law introduced in this Bill. Other speakers had expressed his sentiments, and so what he wished now simply to do was to draw the attention of the Govern-  ment to a very remarkable decision that had been given in his district. There it had been de- cided-by whom, he did not know-that certifi- cates of exemption would not be granted unless the parent produced a certificate signed by a doctor stating that the child was not fit for vaccination. The decision that had been come to by Parliament last year was that if a parent had conscientious objections to vaccination that parent on making a declaration before the Registrar could have his children exempted. He trusted the House would not budge one iota from the decision it had come to last year, that exemption should be granted upon parents making a simple declaration before a Registrar that they had conscientious objections to vac- cination. Mr. BUDDO (Kaiapoi) said that after the strong objections already made to this parti- cular clause it was hardly necessary to say a word, but he wished to join in the vigorous protest against any legislation of this sort being forced upon the country. He admitted it was a debatable subject : but medical testi. mony was to the effect that after a period of seven years vaccination was absolutely value- less. Now, there had been no epidemic of small-pox in this colony, and if small-pox came here the sanitary conditions had been so much improved that he thought there was little chance of the disease making headway. That being so, why should they force upon parents who had a strong objection to it the neces- sity of inflicting upon their children a painful operation, that was in many cases also a dangerous one ? The present law was more - suited to country settlers, and was sufficient to meet the necessities of the case, and if an epidemic came there were already enacted stringent laws to meet the circumstances. And vaccination should not be performed except from pure calf-lymph. He did not think the House should for a moment entertain the proposal to adopt this clause. He took it that if the House voted against the motion that would be sufficient to throw out the proposal, but would like to know if it was necessary to move an amendment. Mr. SPEAKER said the honourable member might move an amendment to agree to all the amendments of the Legislative Council except the new clause 2A. Mr. BUDDO then moved, To add to the original motion the words "except the new clause 24, to which this House disagrees." Sir J. G. WARD (Minister of Public Health) only desired to explain to honourable members what the position really was. Personally he had no objection whatever to a Conference upon the particular clause in question if honourable members so desired it. The amendment was not the Government's, but was made in another place, and he understood the reason for the alteration was that, as would be found, in con- sequence of the terms of the original Act, either Magistrate or Registrar, in addition to having to take a statutory declaration of the person desiring exemption, was required to take evi- dence. Now, many of the Registrars in New Zealand were in receipt of $5. $10, or $20 per annum, and it was found that these people could not give the time that was necessary in order to allow the provisions of the Act to be carried out without seriously interfering with their private affairs. It was not fair to ask that these officials should do this. If honourable members wanted a new department set up, or could suggest any better offcial to deal with this matter than the Magistrate, he was willing to consider the suggestion. Honourable members were aware that exception was taken to the inclusion of "Registrars " when that official was included in the Bill, and if they were going to occupy the time of Registrars in this matter they should make provision for the payment to them of something like adequate salaries, since they were required to take not only statutory declarations, but also evidence in support of such declarations. An Hon. MEMBER .- Add " Postmaster." Sir J. G. WARD said that Postmasters could not give the necessary time to this matter, and, as he had said, the Registrars could not do it. The principle of the right of people who had conscientious objections to vaccination to obtain exemption had been affirmed, and was now the law of the land, and the question was how could they best make provision to give effect to that. If honourable members insisted upon the inclusion of "Registrars" in that particular clause, it was still his duty to point out why it was proposed that this amendment should be made. The person 
<page:400>
3.0. matter, and whose duty it was to de- vote the necessary time to do so, and who was paid for it, was the Stipendiary Magis- trate ; and if honourable members, with that explanation before them, wanted to continue to have the Registrars, many of whom, as he had said, were in receipt of £5 a year, to do this class of work, which they never expected to have to do, then the Government would require to make independent provision for the Regis- trars throughout the length and breadth of the colony. An Hon. MEMBER .- What about the exemp- tion of parents who have conscientious ob- jections ? Sir J. G. WARD said that according to the Act an application for exemption had to be "supported by a statutory declaration, and by such other evidence as the Magistrate or Regis- trar in each case thinks reasonable, and no fee shall be payable in respect of either the applica- tion or the certificate." If the Registrar or the Magistrate were not satisfied, supposing a case of small-pox was reported in a particular dis- trict, it was then their duty to take other evi- dence in that particular district to ascertain the wishes of the people who desired to be exempt from vaccination. An Hon. MEMBER .-- That is the duty of the Health Department. Sir J. G. WARD said no doubt it was; but the law as it now stood imposed duties on the Registrars, and it would mean the appoint-  ment of persons for this purpose all over the country. He admitted the force of the objec- tions that were raised, and he would be glad to know of any better way of doing it. If it was the wish of the House to have a Conference on the subject with the other Chamber, in order to suggest that other persons should be set up and paid for this duty, well and good. He thought, himself, that to impose the duty on the Regis- trars, as at present paid, was not fair or practi- cable. Mr. R. THOMPSON said the Stipendiary Magistrates were not accessible in many places. Sir J. G. WARD said the declaration might be made, and sent to a Magistrate. It might be . and he ventured to suggest to the honourable made. and sent on to a Magistrate; and then, if he required evidence, it could be brought before ! in New Zealand who had to deal with so many him. An Hon. MEMBER .- And possibly they might have to travel a hundred miles. Sir J. G. WARD said, if small-pox were re- ported in a district a hundred miles away it : had to administer the old-age pensions, he was would be the duty of the Magistrate to find out whether it was desirable to have evidence taken, and whether it was desirable to allow any i he (Mr. Fraser) came from the Magistrate had exemptions during the time of a visitation of small-pox. Mr. FOWLDS said it was so rarely these emergencies arose that the Magistrates might . attend to the matter without any trouble. Sir J. G. WARD said, personally he had no feeling in the matter. He would like to ex- plain, regarding clause 2, which had been re- ferred to by the honourable member for Frank- lin - that was the clause giving power to prohibit ! tions of this kind, surely it was not too great Sir J. G. Ward fectious diseases -- that at present, if the Health Department should have it reported to them that there was likely to be any infectious disease brought into the colony in any particular class of goods that was being imported, they had to go to the Customs Department and get that department to put into operation the power they had to prevent the landing of such goods, and, if necessary, to see to the destruction of them. As a matter of departmental conveni- ence, it was desirable that this power should be under the control of, and be administered by, the Public Health Department. There was no change in the power itself ; the clause in the Bill was simply for the purpose of enabling this power to be exercised by the Health De- partment. However, upon this matter of the Registrar he was quite prepared to take the feeling of the House. If members thought it was desirable to continue the Registrars, and wished to have a Conference set up in order to meet the gentlemen from another place, he had no objection. He simply put before them what the position was, and if they considered that public convenience would be better consulted in the way he had indicated. he was quite pre- pared to agree to it. Mr. WITHEFORD (Auckland City) said the only exception he would take to the alterations was with regard to the prohibition of the im- portation of goods which in the opinion of the Governor in Council were likely to introduce infectious diseases. He thought there was a tendency to place too much power in the hands 1 of the Governor in Council. He was inclined to think that, instead of leaving the power en- tirely in the hands of the Governor in Council, the local bodies ought to have some power in the matter. He thought it was unduly limit- ing the measure of local control to leave it entirely to the Wellington people to decide whether in Auckland there were infectious goods that should not be landed there. Mr. A. L. D. FRASER (Napier) said the Minister in charge of the Bill seemed to wish to put on the shoulders of the Magistrates a | great deal more work than they had at present, gentleman that there was no Government officer responsible duties as the Magistrates of the towns and country districts. The Magistrate had not only to deal with all civil and criminal matters coming under his jurisdiction, but he Chairman of the Licensing Bench, and he was the local Coroner. He knew that in the district to travel many hundreds of miles. It was the same on the East Coast, in the Hon. Mr. Car- roll's district. The Minister had pointed out, as an objection to leaving these duties to the Registrars of Births, Deaths, and Marriages, that they were not over well paid, and that therefore it was too much to ask them to undertake the extra duty. Well, if a Registrar at $5 a year were capable of investigating ques- 
<page:401>
an ordeal to intrust to Justices of the Peace as well. And, again, if Justices of the Peace were included in the list of officers by whom this duty could be carried out, why not also include the officer in charge of the police in the district? It was evidently very simple, and there was nothing difficult or of a technical nature about it. All these officials might be intrusted with the power to take the evidence and to grant the certificate. On the general question, however, of vaccina- tion he had a most decided opinion. He spoke as a parent of children, and had not the slightest diffidence in declaring that he had never had any of his children vaccinated, and never would. He was not speaking so much from medical authority in taking this stand, but from very sad experiences that had come under his notice. Although Government officers so far had not thought fit to prosecute him for non-compliance with the law in this respect, they were at liberty now to do so if they chose. To demon- strate his strength of conviction he had freely confessed that none of his children were vacci- nated ; and he would go further, and say that if the Almighty blest him with others hereafter he would take good care that they should not undergo an operation that was so questionable in its benefits. Mr. GRAHAM (Nelson City) was very pleased to hear these protests from all sides of the House in reference to any attempt to alter the law in regard to the exemption from vaccination. He sincerely hoped that those  members who protested would carry their protests further, if necessary, by their votes in the House. Last year they had a new Public Health Act, and many members who, like himself, had conscientious objections to compulsory vaccination worked very hard to get the modified exemption which was ulti- mately given by that Act. They never knew where they were; there seemed to be no finality. The Government were continually introducing into amending Acts of Parliament something that would undo what had been done in a previous session, and it was wrong that that should be done. Last year's legis- lation provided that children could be ex- empted from vaccination if their parents or guardians had conscientious objections to it, and made known those objections to a Magistrate or any Registrar, and people were just getting to know and to under- stand the facilities that existed to enable them to claim such exemption. After the Act was passed last year numbers of people waited on him - probably they waited on other members as well- and asked him what they should do. They had waited on a Magistrate, and the Magistrate, notwithstanding the exemption clause, said they would have to pay a fee of half a crown. He (Mr. Graham) saw one of the parents who refused to pay the half a crown, and sent that parent back to the Magistrate with a note that no fee could be charged, and it was then found that no half a crown needed to be paid at all. However, all who had paid the half a crown-and many poor people had done VOL. OXVII .- 25. so-did not get it back again once it had found its way into the Government chest. It was now proposed to contine the power to the Magistrate alone, and to take it out of the hands of the Registrars. Well, people now had to go to the Registrars to register births, deaths, and marriages, and marriages were also frequently solemnised by the same officer ; and if he did all these various analogous duties, surely he might be allowed to carry out the duties with reference to conscientious objections to vaccination. The law ought at least to be allowed to remain as it was. It already gave a minimum of concession in return for a maximum of trouble. Those members of the House who themselves held conscientious scruples against vaccination had no little amount of trouble last year to get the con- cessions made, and the Government should not now try to further limit the already limited opportunities that people possessed in the way of exemption. Like the honourable member for Napier, he also had a large family, now grown-up, and they were as healthy as he was himself, and not one of them had been vaccinated. He had many notices served on him-ordinary notices and peremptory notices -but he took no notice of them ; and when he told the Registrar of that time that he had con- scientious objections to vaccination the officer said he held a like opinion, and that if he had children himself he would do the same thing. He (Mr. Graham) trusted the House would not only strongly protest against the proposed alteration, but that they would also support that protest by their votes, so that the large number of parents op- posed who had conscientious objections might give effect to them without being put to needless trouble. Exemption from vaccina. tion had to be claimed now within four months of the birth of a child, otherwise it could not be obtained ; and, as a matter of fact, many country and back - block settlers had not the opportunity during that time of going into a town where they could see a Magistrate. He knew from personal experience of mothers who would sooner go anywhere or before any one other than before a Magistrate, and he knew also that Magistrates were not willing in all cases to be obliging in the performance of these duties after they had been forced upon them. They looked on the duty as one that was being thrust upon them-one they ought not to have added to their numerous other duties-and, taking all the circumstances into consideration, he was firmly of the opinion that if the law was to be altered at all it should be in the direction of extending the opportunities that already existed. He would like to see a provision put into the Bill giving the people the right to make declarations before any police officer or any Justice of the Peace, in addition to Magistrates and Registrars. It was certainly not fair that parents should be compelled to have poisonous virus injected into the systems of their children, and he hoped the House would strongly oppose the inclusion of the clause in - the Bill. 
<page:402>
what had already been said by previous speakers. He considered the greatest facility should be afforded parents to protest against their children being vaccinated. Many people believed that the true remedy for small-pox was inoculation, and that it was a sufficient remedy; but he was sorry to say he had seen diseases that had resulted to young children from the effects of vaccination. He did not consider it was fair to cast the duty on Magis- trates of taking evidence and making declara- tions. They were already overworked. It was also unfair to ask that parents should have to travel a long distance, as they would have to do in many cases, to see a Magistrate. A simple declaration by a parent before a Justice of the Peace that the parent was unwilling to have his children vaccinated should be quite sufficient. It would answer all purposes, it would give little trouble to anybody, and it would give satisfaction to the public. Mr. T. MACKENZIE (Waihemo) hoped the Minister would carry the restrictive clause. This was a maudlin age, and anything in the shape of restrictions were irksome to certain people. They all knew the enormous benefit that vaccination had been to the world. Hon. MA.MBERS .- Question. Mr. T. MACKENZIE said it was all very well for honourable gentlemen to say "Ques- tion," but it was beyond dispute that vaccina- tion had been of vast advantage to humanity. Yet now there were a lot of sentimentalists who wanted to extend every facility of evading what had been proved to be of great use to humanity. The whole of the arguments they had used had been directed rather against impure lymph that might have been intro- #cc-zero duced than against the Act ; but it appeared to him that if proper precautions were taken, such as one might expect would be taken by the Health Officer the colony now possessed -- Dr. Mason, a gentleman who was pains- taking in every respect-the result would be to the advantage of the people, and not to their disadvantage, and at the same time a very useful Act would not be evaded. The honour- able member for Nelson City said he had seven children, and that they were grown-up and ex- ceedingly healthy, although they had not been vaccinated. Well, he (Mr. Mackenzie) also had seven children, all vaccinated, and he ventured to say they were as healthy as the honourable member's, or any honourable member's who were vaccinated. It seemed to him that the result of any laxity would be that, if small-pox should unfortunately come to the colony, those persons who were supposed to be more con- siderate to their children than those who be- lieved in vaccination would be the very ones who would spread the disease throughout the length and breadth of the colony. He ventured to say that if they were going to extend the facilities as suggested by the honourable member for Wanganui and the honourable member for Nelson City, it would be better to wipe the Act out of existence altogether. He saw no reason why a minority of the people maintain the health of the country when four- fifths were allowed to escape. The view he held on the matter was that if people wanted exemption, and had conscientious scruples, they should go to a Magistrate. That was done in England ; and he knew that such an exten- sion of facilities as honourable members were urging now had led to very considerable alarm in Great Britain, and, owing to the vast num- ber who now escaped from vaccination, it was feared that if an epidemic broke out to any extent it would have a much more extensive field for operation than would be the case if all these people had been vaccinated. He thought insistence on the purity of the lymph and the way in which it was used should occupy the attention of the Government rather than an extension of facilities for exemption from vac- cination. Mr. MONK (Waitemata) said he would sup- port the opposition to the provision, introduced in another place, that only Magistrates should have power to exempt parents from the obliga- tion to have their children vaccinated. He felt amused at the alacrity with which honourable members had taken the opportunity of adver- tising their contributions to the birth-rate. He was not going to record the self-praise he might But he had been particu- adduce in this respect larly impressed with the silence that had been ob- served by the Minister of Justice on this subject. Science had taught them enough to convince them that every parent ought to be very careful indeed over having his children vaccinated. The remark made by the honourable member for Waihemo -- that the fact that the Medical Super- intendent of the colony was an able man would be a sufficient guarantee that the lymph would in all cases be pure-was sheer nonsense. It was not possible for any medical man to be able to say there might not be bacterial germs lurking in the veins of any individual which might be inimical to the health of an infant who was His vaccinated from such a person's arm. belief in the matter - and he thought it was also pretty well the consensus of medi- cal testimony - was that it would be advis- able for the Government not to allow any child to be vaccinated except with lymph from heifers. There would be a certainty of immunity from disease which was known to lurk in the human subject, even from genera- tion to generation, and he hoped the Govern- ment would accept the suggestions made by the honourable member for Napier, by rather en- larging the opportunities for parents to be ex- empted. He could not but think that members who devised the restrictive forms of interference with the personal convenience of citizens must have an experience that had been limited to city life, for they seemed quite oblivious to the difficulties which existed in some parts of the colony in getting access to Magistrates. In some parts of his electorate it would be a serious task to have to reach a Magistrate to obtain an exemption. These were matters that required attention, and the Minister should feel rather pleased that members had afforded him, 
<page:403>
from their different points of view, an oppor- tunity of judging of the merits or demerits of the amendment before them. He spoke as the representative of a very sparsely populated district, and he knew this would inflict hard- ships on many if they were compelled to go before a Magistrate ; they would have far enough to go to reach a Registrar or Justice of the Peace. He did not think, however, that honourable members need be under any very great apprehension as to the large amount of work there would be imposed on country Regis- trars. Babies did not come in a deluge, but were nicely distributed over the roll of time. He did not think, speaking from his know- ledge of his own district, any officials were so hardly worked as the Stipendiary Magis- trates in this colony, looking at the distances they had to travel, and the many places at which they had to sit. Summing up his per- sonal opinion on the matter, it was that the Government should make it penal for any child to be vaccinated from a human subject or arm-to-arm ; and, further, that in the interests of good health they should make it a special duty to see that lym ph fromthe cow be pro- vided, and none other. He did not think the proposed amendment was at all necessary, and he felt it his duty to vote against it. Mr. HOUSTON (Bay of Islands) said the difficulty in this matter arose altogether from the clause in the Act of 1900. He contended that vaccination should be made compulsory on one condition - that the Government should supply pure lymph imported from Germany. He had conscientious objections to arm-to-arm Vaccination as performed by medical men. He had vaccinated all his own children, to the number of ten, and he got his lymph direct from Germany, and be considered the Govern- ment would be wanting in their duty in not providing pure lymph and making vaccination compulsory. All this difficulty about lymph would have been avoided if that had been done instead of inserting the clause in the Act of 1900. In regard to the clause under considera- tion, he thought it would be imposing too much And in his on the Stipendiary Magistrates. district there were cases in which a parent would have to travel ninety or a hundred miles to reach one, and this was an unfair penalty to impose on any parent. Even in the case of Registrars they would have to travel forty or fifty miles. Major STEWARD (Waitaki) said there were two sets of facts to be taken into consideration in connection with this question : one of these proved that vaccination administered carefully under proper conditions resulted in a large im- munity from small-pox, and even in the case of persons being attacked it reduced the death- rate very much indeed. This fact was not to be disputed. But there was also 3.30. another set of facts which caused an agitation against vaccination, and which showed that in consequence of arm-to-arm vaccination there had been transmitted to numbers of indi- viduals diseases not of the nature of small-pox, against which vaccination was used as a pre- ventive, but diseases of an almost equally deadly nature. It was therefore not sur- prising that there should have been an agi- tation against the arm-to-arm transference. The honourable member for Waitemata and the honourable member for the Bay of Islands had hit the mark. If our legislation made it penal for any operator to vaccinate by trans- ference from arm to arm, and then provided that every person should have his children vaccinated by pure calf-lymph, he did not think there would be any further conscien- tious objection taken, and we should have our population almost immune from small-pox. He was old enough to remember that, say, some forty and odd years ago, in England it was the most natural thing in the world to notice the scars of small-pox in the faces of persons whom one met. It was scarcely possible to get a do- mestic servant in the country who was not more or less pitted. Then, there were dreadful cases of blindness caused by this disease, and a large number of deaths, besides various other bodily ailments which small-pox frequently left behind it. Any person who travelled through the same districts in England now would scarcely meet with a single individual who was pitted with small-pox. Now, that change had been brought about by the adoption of the system of vaccina- tion. Only a few years ago, in the Cityof Glasgow, where the practice of vaccination had fallen into desuetude, they were confronted with an outbreak of small-pox which came from outside the city. Attacking only a few cases at first, it spread with almost inconceivable rapidity over a population which had not secured immunity by vaccination. The result was, there was an enormous death-rate, which ran into a per- centage of, he thought, something like 80 among those attacked. Efforts were then made to vaccinate the population. Thousands and thousands of people were vaccinated, and even- tually the disease was stamped out. The ex- perience gained on that occasion plainly showed the benefits of vaccination. It was shown that vaccinated persons were comparatively immune from attacks of small-pox, and that the most recently vaccinated persons were the most im. mune. Therefore the case for vaccination was absolutely complete. He was strongly in favour of vaccination, but he would not have it com- pulsory, unless only pure calf-lymph was used. Amendment agreed to, and motion as amended agreed to. Sir J. G. WARD moved, That Mr. Buddo, Mr. A. L. D. Fraser, and the mover be ap- pointed a Committee to draw up reasons for disagreeing to new clause 2A. Motion agreed to. MORTGAGES OF LAND BILL. Sir J. G. WARD (Colonial Secretary) .- Sir, this Bill has been introduced by the honourable member for Waitaki, and passed through the House upon two or three former occasions. It has also been before the Statutes Revision Com- mittee, and in that respect the necessary con- ditions have been met. I think it will be agreed on all sides that if anything can be done to 
<page:404>
facilitate mortgages of land, or the transfer or redemption of mortgages, it is a desirable thing to effect. The main proposal in this Bill is to have a schedule with proper covenants imply. ing the requisite mortgage conditions printed, so that they could be used with a view of either having mortgages effected, or reduced, or re- lieved altogether. An Hon. MEMBER .- Will it reduce the cost ? Sir J. G. WARD .- Yes, I think it will, and it certainly will add to the convenience of people who have to do with mortgages. If any- thing can be done to facilitate the transfer of land in the colony, I think it ought to commend itself to the consideration of honourable mem- bers. The schedules attached to the Bill con- tain the requisite covenants for a mortgage. I beg to move the second reading of the Bill. Mr. McNAB (Mataura) .- I am not going to oppose the Bill. In fact, I intend to sup- port it. When this Bill was in the hands of the honourable member for Waitaki I sup- ported it on each occasion on which it came before the House. But what I want to call the honourable gentleman's attention to for a moment is this: If he looks at the Second Schedule he will find set out there the covenants which are to be implied in the mortgage, and the covenant under the head " Secondly " is a covenant that the mortgagor shall insure against loss by fire the property and buildings on the land. Now, since this Bill went through the Statutes Revision Committee, there has been introduced into our law the liability on the holder of land to have recovered against him, at any time that an accident may take place, damages arising through injury resulting to any employé on his property, under the Workers'   Compensation for Accidents Act of last year, and it will have the effect of necessitating from now onwards a practice amongst the legal profession to put in mortgages a covenant not only to insure against fire, but to keep all the employés working on the property in- sured against liability under this Act of 1900 ; and I would suggest that the honourable gentle- man get the Law Officer to bring down a clause to be added to the Second Schedule, providing that the mortgagor will also insure and keep himself insured against that liability. It can be done by extending the operation of the Second Schedule to insure not only against fire, but against the liability under the Act of last year. Otherwise you will find that mortgages executed on this form will not protect the mortgagee in some cases of an emplove recover- ing damages against an employer. If the con- tractor is not able to meet the claim it will come back upon the landowner, and if he in turn cannot pay it will come back upon the mort- gagee. That is the only alteration that I con- sider necessary on account of the legislation passed by this House since the measure was before the Statutes Revision Committee. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) .-- Before the question is put I would like to say that the point raised by the honourable member for Mataura is one that requires the careful consideration of this House. I would like the Minister in charge of Sir J. G. Ward the Bill to say what he has found to be the practice already with regard to mortgages. Now that an accident is a first charge on a property, I believe it is already the practice for the mortgagee himself to insure, so that the suggestion of the honourable member for Mataura may not be in the direction of making it easier for the mortgagor. At pre- sent I understand that the mortgagee himself insures his mortgage. Mr. McNAB .- He cannot deduct it unless the mortgage allows him. Mr. J. ALLEN .- He pays it out of his own pocket at present ; but if provision is made in the Bill, as the honourable member for Ma- taura suggests, it will come out of the pocket of the mortgagor. There is another part of the schedule which I think the honourable member in charge of the Bill should have amended. ] notice that in the second part of the Second Schedule it is provided that the mortgagor will insure and will keep insured all buildings and erections for the time being on the land. That is to be done in the name of the mortgagee. I do not know whether that is the common prac- tice now in New Zealand. Mr. McNAB .- It is almost the universal practice. Mr. J. ALLEN .- It is not universal. If the insurance were to be done jointly in the name of both the mortgagee and mortgagor it would give the mortgagor some interest in his build- ings as well, and I hope the Minister will see his way to do this. If the alteration is made, some amendment of the 5th section of the Second Schedule will be necessary. At present it provides that, in the event of the buildings being burnt, the mortgagee may elect for him- self whether the moneys shall be applied to- wards the payment of the principal, interest, and other moneys covered by the security, or towards rebuilding or repairing the build- ings or erections so destroyed or damaged. I hold that the mortgagor ought to have some- thing to say as to the disposal of the money in a case like that. If the money has been spent in buildings on the ground, the security remains, just as it would have been if the mortgagee had accepted payment of that part of his capital. I certainly think that the mortgagor has a right to be joined in the insurance, and, in the second place, he has a right to have a say in the disposal of the money after the buildings have been burnt down and the money paid over by the insurance com- panies. These points should receive careful consideration in Committee. As to the general principle of the Bill, I do not think it will cheapen mortgages to the extent of one penny. The provisions of clauses 5, 6, 7, and 8 may be convenient for the increase or decrease of mort- gages, and for transfers. I believe a practice of indorsing mortgages similar to that proposed prevails at present, when a certain amount has been paid off, or even when it has been in- creased. I do not know whether the expenses are heavier than under this Bill-probably they are not. Although it may appear that we are to get some conveniences under this Bill, 
<page:405>
process will be cheapened at all. Major STEWARD (Waitaki) .- I would like to draw the last speaker's attention to the pro- visions of subsection (2) of section 3, in con- nection with his suggestion that the terms of one or two covenants in the Second Schedule need some alteration. The honourable member will see it there stated :- "In every mortgage executed under this Act there shall be implied all the covenants and conditions set forth in the Second Schedule hereto, except in so far as is otherwise expressed in such mortgage." . So that the person who wants a mortgage to contain covenants different from those given in the schedule will not use the form therein set out, but where both parties to the mortgage ac- cept the ordinary conditions as therein set out they can use the form as given in the Schedule. I would point out that the provisions of this Bill are not new to New Zealand, for under "The Government Advances to Settlers Act, 1894," The precisely the same system is followed. Third Schedule of that Act contains a form al- most identical with that in the First Schedule of this Bill, and the Fourth Schedule of that Act also, mutatis mutandis, corresponds with the Second Schedule of the present Bill. The honourable member for Bruce just now referred to the proposal under this Bill that the insur- ance policy shall be effected in the name of the mortgagee. Mr. J. ALLEN .- I want it to be done jointly. Major STEWARD .- Yes; the honourable member takes exception to the policy being in the name of the mortgagee only, and thinks it should be in the joint names of the mortgagor   and the mortgagee. With regard to all the mortgages made under the Advances to Settlers Act, this Bill really proposes to follow on the same lines, as under that Act all insurances must be in the name of the mortgagee. I do not express any strong opinion on the question raised by the honourable gentleman, but I think that if he gets his way in Committee he will do away, to a considerable extent, with the willing- uess of mortgagees to use the simple form pro- vided by the Bill. I believe that a large number of persons will be found willing to adopt a simple form of this kind. This Bill, if passed, will, I think, afford relief to a very considerable If honourable members number of persons. will turn to the return dealing with mortgages, to be found in the Appendices to the Journals of last session, they will find that last year, that is, from the 31st March, 1899, to the 31st March, 1900, there were registered in New Zealand no fewer than 11,814 mortgages, so that there are at least twenty-three thousand people, mortgagees and mortgagors, interested in these transactions. If only one-fourth of these persons should be wil- ling to come under a Bill of this kind, something like five thousand people would each save a cer- tain sum of money every year. Now, the amount of money dealt with by way of mortgage is also interestingly stated in the return referred to. I find that the total amount of money represented by the mortgages of last year was no less than small means are interested in this matter I need only point to the fact that, of the total 11,814 mortgages registered, there were no less than 9,160 that were for sums under and up to #500, so that the matter of saving even a few shil- lings on nine thousand mortgages by persons who are not too well off in the world is an item for consideration. Then, as a similar system to that proposed in this Bill has been in operation since 1894 in regard to Government mortgages, I can see no earthily reason why it should not work equally well with regard to private mort- gages. Seeing that the Bill is purely optional, and that no person, unless so disposed, need use the form prescribed under the Bill, and that that form will only be used when both mort- gagor and mortgagee are so disposed, it appears to me that no honourable member should object to its becoming law. I hope the honourable gentleman will succeed in securing the passing of the Bill. Mr. R. THOMPSON (Marsden). - I fail to see what good this Bill can do if it is passed. It is, as the last speaker has said, optional ; and if the honourable gentleman thinks that the passing of a Bill of this kind is going to bring about an alteration all over the colony of the way in which the legal profession conduct this business, or that it will affect the conduct of those who lend money on mortgage, my conclu- sion is that the honourable gentleman knows very little about the business he is speaking of. I know that he himself is the author of the Bill: he has brought it forward several times, and no doubt would like to see it pass ; but I am afraid that his practical knowledge of this question must be very trifling. I venture to say that if the Bill passes it will have no effect on the mortgaging business of the colony. I would point out to the Minister in charge of the Bill that the Government now are the principal mortgagees in the colony. They do the largest business ; and I ask, is it going to affect their system of dealing with the ques- tion ? Not a bit. I do not think it will do the borrower any good whatever, and I am quite satisfied that the members of the legal profes- sion will not be influenced in any way by it. I certainly think it would be just as well if the Government left things as they are, for this is only a waste of time. I think this should be left to the honourable member for Waitaki. Personally, I do not care whether the Bill passes or not, because I am satisfied it will have no effect whatever. As to the question of insurance, of course the lender will always dictate his terms as to how the buildings are to be insured. I know it has often been the case, even in respect of trust property, that the buildings have not been sufficiently insured to enable them to be rebuilt when they have been destroyed by fire, and the result has been that the mortgagor has had to find money to pay in part for their rebuilding, supplementing the amount of the insurance before the build- ings could be reinstated. I know several cases in which trust properties that have been burned down have not been sufficiently insured to re- 
<page:406>
about any alteration whatever in that respect. Though I have no doubt it would please the honourable member who is the father of this Bill to see it pass, for he has brought it for- ward for two or three sessions, I do not think it would really do anybody any harm or any good. Mr. HOGG (Masterton) .- I differ slightly from the last speaker with regard to the merits of the Bill. In past years I have supported a somewhat similar measure which was brought up by the honourable member for Waitaki. I believe the object of the Bill is a good one : it is simply to reduce the cost that mortgagors have to contend with when they borrow money pri- vately. I think that is a very good object. We know that a very large number of enterprising people in this colony, as in all new countries, re- quire the aid of capital, and they ought to be as- sisted in every possible way, by having the forms they have to comply with simplified as much as possible and made inexpensive. Now, the whole object and scope of this Bill, as far as I can see, is to simplify these processes and re- duce the expenses attached to them. In the past borrowers have had to pay somewhat heavy charges in connection with mortgages. Now, we have a simple form of mortgage prescribed under this Bill. Under present conditions the various Land Boards have a great deal of trouble examining every mortgage that comes before them. The provisions of the Land Act of 1892 require Crown tenants to submit their deeds of mortgage to the Land Boards and obtain the permission of the Boards before they are allowed to mortgage their properties. Now, inasmuch as each solicitor who prepares these deeds inserts his own terms and conditions, it requires a great deal of time and trouble on the part of the Commissioners and members of the Boards before they are able sufficiently to overhaul and examine the documents, and see whether the terms are of a reasonable character or not. This Bill aims at uniformity, and at protecting the mortgagor as well as the mort- gagee. Both will be protected by having some uniform form of mortgage prescribed. Why, Sir, this should have been done years ago, instead of being left to the present time. There are a great many mortgages executed in the country every year, and it is very desirable that the necessary deeds should not be ren- dered too expensive. With regard to the registration of covenants, conditions, and other processes, everything should be simplified. If the parties are agreed and attach their names, that indorsement should be sufficient. The Bill before us provides that the mortgage can be altered or its terms extended by a pro- cess exceedingly simple, and at the same time inexpensive. There is one thing, how- ever, that has been omitted, and probably when it goes into Committee I will endeavour to get the omission filled in. That is, in con- nection with mortgages for a specified term. In cases where they have been running over three years, or as soon as a term of three years is up, the mortgagor should have an opportunity, Mr. R. Thompson mortgage. As now happens, a mortgagor may have to wait for a number of years, although the rate of interest has altered very materially, before he is allowed to redeem his mortgage. Now, I think that is unfair. There ought to be a provision for redemption on reasonable notice in every mortgage, and, in cases where no pro- viso of the kind is made, it ought to be made mandatory that if a man chooses to say, " Iam going to redeem my mortgage and pay up the debt," by giving six months' notice he should have the opportunity of doing so. I 4.0. hope members of the House will sup- port me in getting such a proviso as I have indicated inserted in the Bill. Mr. SYMES (Egmont). - This is a lovely lawyers' Bill, and I am certain the last speaker has never read the Bill, or he would have under- stood it better than to speak of its effect as he did. He talks about the difference in the mort- gages of Crown tenants. Why, they are all the same ; they are all under the Land Transfer Act. Mr. HOGG. - I was referring to private mortgages. Mr. SYMES. - They are not Crown tenants. Private mortgages cannot possibly come before the Land Board. Mr. HOGG .-- But they do. Mr. SYMES .-- It is utterly impossible, be- cause they must all be under the Land Trans- fer Act, and they are all on the usual form. I notice that not one single lawyer has spoken on the Bill, showing- Mr. GRAHAM .-- They all want it to pass. Mr. SYMES. - Of course they do. Now, it is. utterly impossible to carry this into effect. The Bill says in the Second Schedule :- "Secondly, that the mortgagor will forthwith insure, and, so long as any money remains owing on the security, will keep insured, all buildings and erections for the time being situate on the said land against loss or damage by fire, in the name of the mortgagee, to their full insurable value, in some insurance office in New Zealand to be approved by the mortgagee, and will duly and punctually pay all premiums and sums of money necessary for the purpose of keeping every such insurance on foot. And will, not later than the forenoon of the day on which any premium falls due, deliver or cause to be de- livered the receipt therefor to the mortgagee, who shall also be entitled to the exclusive custody of all policies of insurance." Why, Sir, the thing is an absurdity. It may happen that on this particular day on which the premium falls due the mortgagor and the mort- gagee may be thousands of miles distant from each other, and, under these circumstances, how is it possible to deliver this receipt ? There may not be a post-office within reach to get the re- ceipt delivered in time. Anyway, a permissive thing of this kind could never be of any use. It is very clear to my mind, at any rate, that the father of this Bill has never had anything to do with mortgages. An Hon. MEMBER .- Lucky man. Mr. SYMES .- I do not think that neces -. 
<page:407>
thing to do with mortgages are the men that keep the place going. I do not mean the Shylocks, of course, but those men who bor- row and invest the money in various enter- prises, for they are the people who find useful outlets for the capital of men who would not do anything with it themselves. I say this is only a permissive Bill, and could not possibly be carried out, and to think that its provisions and conditions may be agreed to is very unlikely. Did you ever hear of a mortgagee giving the mortgagor the chance to dictate the terms of the mortgage ? All I can say is that the author of this Bill must be very simple if he thinks so. I have had a good deal to do with both mortgagors and mortgagees, and seeing other people's mortgages carried into effect. I know well that the mortgagee every time dictates the terms where, when, and how it shall be done. Now, under the Land Transfer Act-and all the Crown lands in this country are under it- you get the same form at 1s. What would be the effect of this on the Land Transfer Act, and what would be the effect of this in con- nection with Government lands and Govern- ment mortgages in this country? I think, before we should be asked to pass a Bill of this kind, at any rate the Minister in charge should have explained how this measure would affect us, and whether it would clash with any other form of mortgage in use in the colony. At any rate, Sir, I, as a member of this House, am not going to swallow a Bill of this sort until it is thoroughly explained. I shall certainly vote against the second reading of the Bill. Mr. G. J. SMITH (Christchurch City) .- I think that this Bill is a very harmless piece of legislation, and I hardly think it is worth the while of a Minister of the Crown to father it. It will need a much better Bill than this, which is really one belonging to the honourable mem- ber for Waitaki, to effect the purpose he has in view. The honourable member for Waitaki, year after year, brings forward in this House a number of small Bills, with the object of which we all sympathize, but he seems to lack the ex- pert knowledge necessary to put his measures forward in the best way. Now, so far as this Bill is concerned, it is entirely optional in its pro- visions. The terms suggested in it may or may not be accepted by the mortgagee. I think the probabilities are they would not be accepted. The mortgagee himself will say upon what terms he chooses to lend his money, and if the mortgagor does not choose to accept those terms, then he would have to seek elsewhere for the money he needed. Another thing I would like to point out is that the Bill professes to reduce the cost of mortgages. It will do nothing of the kind. The present position is this : The legal practitioner who prepares the documents, say, under the Land Transfer Act, is paid by a scale according to the amount of the mortgage-money. If this form of mortgage is adopted we are doing three-fourths of the work for the legal practitioner, and at the same time we allow him to charge the same fee as before for the preparation of the mortgage. Waitaki has not acquired greater knowledge on these points before assisting to introduce such a Bill as this into Parliament. It seems to me that, as the Bill is evidently optional, it will not matter much whether it is put on the statute-book or not ; but if it will satisfy the honourable member for Waitaki, and in any way effect its object, then by all means let it be placed on the statute-book. I was astonished to find the honourable member for Masterton getting up just now and saying he proposed in Committee to insert a provision that at the expiration of three years he would give the right to the mortgagor, upon six months' previous notice, to pay off the mort- gage. I presume, therefore, from the same point of view, he would give the mortgagee the right to notify the mortgagor after three years had gone by, that, as the current rate of interest had risen since the agreement was entered into, he proposed to call in the mort- gage-money or charge a higher rate of interest. So far as the provisions of the Bill with refer- ence to insurance and the proposal that the policy of the insurance should be in the joint name of the mortgagor and mortgagee, I agree with the honourable member for Mataura that the policy of insurance ought to be in the name of the mortgagee. If the buildings are of great value, and the amount advanced on them is comparatively small, no doubt the mortgagee would agree that the mortgagor's name should appear on the policy. If the honourable mem- ber wants to carry out his ideas and reduce the cost of mortgages, he should put a scale of charges in the form of a schedule to the Bill, and insert a provision that his form of mort- gages should compulsorily apply to all lands in New Zealand. Mr. WILFORD (Wellington Suburbs) .- Sir, I shall not detain the House for more than one minute. I think I may say I am voicing the opinion of the whole of the lawyers of the House when I say this Bill will have their unanimous support. Last session, when the Bill was introduced by the member for Waitaki, every legal practitioner in the House got up and explained that his view was that the measure was a good one for somebody. The chief disadvantage is that the deed of mortgage under this Bill will not tell the mortgagor the conditions of his contract, because the plain mortgage itself does not in any way set out the conditions under which money is borrowed ; and, if the mortgagee exercises the power he is granted by the statute and the mortgagor feels aggrieved, the mortgagee will say, " Well, that is the law. It is part of an Act of Parliament, and if you want to find out what the mortgagee can do you had better go and look up the statute, and you will find the powers therein set out." If the mortgagor says, " Why not have it in my deed as formerly ?" he will be told the Act says it is not necessary, and that if he wants to know anything about it he will have to look up the statute. I may say that, as far as the im- plied covenants are concerned, the Schedule is in a way a copy of the Chattels Transfer Act. 
<page:408>
nants are implied and set out in that Schedule, and the honourable member who made the statement was in error in saying it was uncom- mon for the buildings on any premises that are mortgaged to be insured in the name of the mortgagor and the mortgagee. I believe that in every mortgage where part of the security is the building it is always required by the mort- gagee that the property shall be insured in the joint name of the mortgagor and the mortgagee ; and it is right that it should be, otherwise there are ways open to fraud that the House should not connive at. Well, Sir, I intend to support the Bill, not from the point of view that it will enrich myself-for as a matter of fact, it will do nothing of the kind - but from the point of view that the measure will do no harm and may help some. I may say that at present Land Transfer mortgage- forms are obtainable at the Land Transfer Office on payment of 1s. The form says on the face of it what is required to be filled in. On the third page there is set out the power of sale, which is also set out in this Bill. I believe that, as the member for Christchurch City has said, the Bill is perfectly harmless, and if the Minister in charge really desires that the Bill should be put through I shall support him, for the reasons I before stated. The mortgagee may be inconvenienced, but no real harm will be done to him. I do not be- lieve that many mortgagees will use this power, for, as the mortgagor has to "pay the piper,"  the lender will, no doubt, conduct his business as of yore. Mr. ATKINSON (Wellington City) .- Sir, I agree with the last speaker, and with the mem- ber for Christchurch City (Mr. Smith), that this is a fairly harmless Bill. I also agree with the member for Christchurch City that it was hardly worthy of the dignity of a Minister of the Crown to introduce it ; but I cannot agree in the amiable view of the same honourable gentleman that because it is a harmless Bill there is no reason why it should not be put on the statute-book. I think, how- aver, that we are entitled to criticize somewhat severely the action of the Minister who has in- troduced this Bill in putting it before us in such a thoroughly perfunctory fashion. There was no explanation of the Bill clause by clause, and not even in general words was there any exposition of the policy that dictated, or may be presumed to have dictated, the introduc- tion of the measure. Of course, we know that the real author of the Bill is the honourable member for Waitaki. On previous occasions that honourable gentleman has made it plain enough, as he did this afternoon, why he had been promoting the measure. He said it was with a view to assist the mortgagor, and to reduce the cost of preparing mortgages. Well, there is no doubt whatever that on that par- ticular matter the interests of the legal pro- fession and the interests of the public are antagonistic. No doubt the legal profession is a great burden on the community. There are far too many lawyers, and their charges are Mr. Wilford might do in this House as a member of the House to reduce that burden I am in duty bound to do. But, so far as this Bill is con- cerned, I feel no conflict whatever between my professional interest and my duties as a mem- ber of this House. I quite agree with the member for Egmont and the member for Mars- den, and, in fact, with the majority of the mem- bers who have spoken, that the practical effect of the Bill must be very slight indeed -hardly appreciable at all-notwithstanding the benevo- lent intentions of the member for Waitaki in originally promoting the Bill. Of course, the theory of the honourable member for Waitaki is really this : that the measure, if passed, will enable mortgagees to make their own mort- gages, and therefore to dispense with profes- sional assistance in the preparation of them. Unless that be the effect of it, then the Bill is going to have no effect, as far as I can see, ex- cept for the subsidiary matter of the last three Unless that is so the main or four clauses. provisions of the Bill will be practically inopera- tive. Mr. WILFORD .- The mortgagee would never take the trouble on himself for nothing. Mr. ATKINSON .- No; of course, the mort- gagee would never take the trouble on himself for nothing. It would be for nothing, because at present the professional work costs the mort- gagee nothing, being always paid for by the mortgagor. But, speaking from the standpoint of the legal profession, one is reminded that the most popular toast with the profession is " The jolly testator who makes his own will "; and if this Bill should be passed, another equally popular toast might be "The jolly mortgagee who makes his own mortgage." "Mortgagor " might well be substituted without detracting from the popularity of the toast. Mr. HERRIES .- You might mention the House of Representatives. Mr. ATKINSON .- Yes ; the House of Repre- sentatives is no doubt the greatest benefactor the legal profession have had in this colony during the last few years. But, Sir, from the standpoint of public policy, assuming that the Bill is going to have some practical effect, I wish to take strong exception to it. I re- gret very much that the Hon. the Minister in charge of the measure is not in the House at present, and I regret also that, though this point to which I take exception was expressly raised by me in the House last year when the Bill had been taken over by the Post- master-General, and he admitted there was something in it, he has paid absolutely no heed to it in the present debate. The main objection I see to the Bill is that it is setting up a sort of hybrid registration system between the two systems that exist now. There is the old system under the Deeds Registration Act, and the new system under the Land Transfer Act : A mortgage executed under this Bill will have the covenants mentioned in the Second Schedule, and may be registered under either system. There is, I see, some work for the lawyers in the first operative clause. What, I would ask, is the 
<page:409>
Act "? Of course, at present a mortgage that is executed at all is, ipso facto, executed under either the Deeds Registration Act or the Land Transfer Act ; but, seemingly, the meaning of the words "executed under this Act " must mean "executed in the form contained in the First Schedule of this Act." Well, assuming that a mortgage were so executed, I ask, Is it a desirable thing, the Land Transfer system being simplicity itself, to introduce a hybrid system? Is it desirable to establish, in the interests of public policy, such a system ? I have spoken of the Legislature as being during recent years the great benefactor of the legal profession in the colony ; but there is no doubt, in passing the Land Transfer Act, the Legislature benented the .community at large enormously at the expense of the legal profession : The profits which the profession drew from the complications of the old system were greatly reduced by the very simple procedure and the security of title given by the Land Transfer system. One of the induce- ments which at the present time induce a wise owner of land to bring it under the Land Trans- fer Act is the lessened cost of dealing with land under the Act. If this Bill is going to have any effect at all it will be to reduce the cost of mort- gages outside the Land Transfer Act, not to make the costs under the two systems equal ; and this distinction calls attention to another fallacy in the argument of the promoter of the Bill, for the mere cost of preparing the deed is-I will not say a small part-but it is by no means the whole of the costs in con- nection with the preparation of the mortgage ; the investigation of the title outside the Land Transfer Act is often a very long, and therefore costly, business. But, speaking generally, the -cost of preparation of the deeds under the old system is considerably more than under the new. Now, if this Bill passes it will equalise the cost under the two systems so far as the mere preparation of the deeds is concerned. Is that desirable in the interests of public policy ? I submit it is not. It is in the interests of the community that all land should as fast as pos- sible be brought under the provisions of the Land Transfer Act, and, if that is so, you will by passing this Bill be taking a retrograde step ; we shall be removing one of the inducements at present existing to have land brought under the Land Transfer Act. Instead of tending to make one system you will have created an extra one, and have given the more ancient one a greater chance of prominence than it appears to enjoy at present. I have here the Land Transfer Amendment Bill introduced by Sir Patrick Buckley in 1892, and members who turn to clauses 14 and 15 of that Bill will find that they provide practically for the compulsory bringing under the Land Transfer Act of all transactions subsequent to the Bill becoming law : - " And whereas it is expedient that all lands within the Colony of New Zealand shall as speedily as possible be brought under the operation of the principal Act, and that, until land can be fully brought under the provisions with regard to dealings with such land and the evidence of title thereto shall be assimilated as nearly as possible to that prescribed by the said Act, but without guarantee of title : Be it there- fore further enacted as follows :- "Except as hereinafter mentioned, no instru- ment executed after the coming into operation of this Act for the purpose of creating, trans. ferring, encumbering, or otherwise dealing with any estate in land shall be registered under 'The Deeds Registration Act, 1868,' if the person or any one of the persons executing such instrument for the purpose aforesaid was at the date of such execution entitled to main- tain in his own name or in his own right an application to have the land brought under the operation of this Act." The very first conveyance of land executed after the passing of this Bill, if it had passed, would have given the purchaser a sort of pro- visional certificate of title under the Land Transfer Act, which in course of time would have matured into a certificate of title in the ordinary form. I will read a few words from Sir Patrick Buckley's speech in the Council in introducing the Bill,- " With regard to the second portion of the Bill, it was explained in the last portion of clause 14 that it was expedient that all lands in the colony should as speedily as possible be brought under the operation of the Land Transfer Act. It was proposed that when the Act came into operation there should be no further registration except under the provisions of the Act. Any person who had a title to land might adopt the simple mode prescribed in the Bill of going to the Registrar, and if the Registrar was satisfied that he had a title he would give him a provisional certificate. After the lapse of a certain time -- twelve years -he might then obtain a certificate of title granted under the Land Transfer Act." Though this may have been considered by the Council at that time too drastic, I would submit to the Minister that it is not in the interests of public policy that any inducement that at present exists to have the operation of the Land Transfer Act widened-to have more land brought under that system-should be re- moved ; and if this Bill is to have any effect at all it will be to lessen to a considerable extent one of the main inducements. I should like the Minister to explain whether the Govern- ment have considered this aspect of the ques- tion. Having considered the Bill a good deal last session, and this session again, this appears to me to be far the most important question of public policy touched by the Bill. In regard to the Schedule itself, no doubt the covenants set out in it approach much more nearly to those ordinarily in use than the covenants im- plied by the Property Law Act or the Land Transfer Act ; and in that respect perhaps the Bill may be considered to effect an improve- ment. But I would suggest that if the Go- vernment are satisfied that the covenants implied by virtue of the Land Transfer Act are now so out of date as to be obsolete, 
<page:410>
3.30. of all, to leave the old system alone entirely with its present disadvantages, so that the owners of land might still have the present inducements to come under the Land Transfer Act ; and, secondly, to amend the Schedule of the Land Transfer Act, so as to make the im- plied covenants under the Land Transfer system agree with those ordinarily inserted in mort- gages at the present time. If that were done, instead of adding a third system you would heighten the inducements to the owners of land to bring their land under the Land Transfer system as quickly as possible. With regard to clauses 5 and 6, I think they are distinctly an advantage. They provide for the amount of a mortgage being increased or re- duced by indorsement on the mortgage ; also for the renewal or extension of the currency of a mortgage. Clauses 5 and 6 are really very valuable alterations in the present law, because a mere indorsement will effect what might otherwise be required to be done by a new deed. An Hon. MEMBER. - The same thing is done now. Mr. ATKINSON .- Certainly the same thing is constantly done. But, speaking technically, greater security will be given to transactions of the kind by this clause than they enjoy at the present time. As to clause 7. 1 think that will only improve the position of a man who has not brought his property under the Land Trans- fer Act, and therefore, on the grounds I have before mentioned, I shall oppose that clause. As the honourable member for Mataura has pointed out, the risk undor the Workers' Compensation Act is certainly a risk which should be covered by the implied covenants in this Bill; but I think the better plan would be to abolish the risk altogether, and remove what seems to me to be the greatest blot on our statute-book of 1900 -- that is, the risk to which owners of land and the mortgagees of land are exposed under the Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act. However, until that is done it is desirable that we should guard against that risk, and that we should have some implied covenant with regard to that risk inserted in the Second Schedule, as well as the covenant for insurance against fire. Sir J. G. WARD .-- Sir, regarding the state- ment of the last speaker, that in introducing this Bill a detailed explanation was not given of the various clauses, I should like to say that when the honourable member has had a con- siderably larger experience of the House than he has at the present time he will find it is not a bad thing when introducing a Bill in this House to be as brief as you can. And, generally speaking, when a Bill has been circulated for a considerable time, and has been in the hands of honourable members, it is natural to suppose that each member has read the clauses of the Bill, and understands the intentions and pur- port of the measure just as well as the intro- ducer of the Bill himself. My object when introducing Bills in this House has always been, while explaining their main objects and Mr. Atkinson planations of the various clauses, and to, as far as possible, do this in Committee. Occa- sionally I have found it necessary to go fully into the details of each clause of a Bill, but my experience, when I have done that, has been that I have been met-more especially in the case of some honourable members opposite-by the statement that they found I was giving the details of clauses of a Bill which they already thoroughly understood, and that my explana- tions were altogether unnecessary and were more for Committee. This is a short Bill, and I can assure honourable members that it was not from any want of courtesy that I did not go more fully into it. On the contrary, I knew the House had already passed the Bill two or three times, and that it had been before the Statutes Revision Committee, and I contented myself with putting on record shortly and tersely what was intended to be brought about by this measure. I should like to say, generally speaking, I think the aim of honourable mem- bers ought to be to simplify as far as possible the system of mortgaging the land, and if the proposals in the Schedule of this Bill are not sufficiently full or clear to meet what is desired, I shall be quite prepared to accept any reason- able suggestions in Committee, with a view of having them made more explicit. Now, I do not believe if this Bill were placed on the statute- book it would clash with the ordinary Land Transfer system at all; and, in reply to the argument adduced by some honourable mem- bers that this being not compulsory it will not be much availed of, all I can say is that there is a great deal more competition now in the matter of lending money than there has been in former years. And those honourable mem- bers who think the mortgagor has to go on his bended knees in order to induce the mortgagee to make any terms the mortgagee thinks fit are mistaken. A mortgagor can now go to a great many people to obtain money. And if a system more inexpensive, and not so difficult as the old one, can be placed at the option of mortgagors and mortgagees, there surely can be no harm done in having a simple, but adequate, schedule placed upon the statute- book as suggested in the Bill. Regarding that portion alluded to by the honourable member for Mataura, I see the point clearly, and I quite recognise that under the Workers' Compensa- tion for Accidents Act there would be a clashing in the direction indicated by the honourable member ; but I think probably he would have heard the head of the Government state in this House that it never was intended that the clauses of the Workers' Compensation Act should apply to the farmers of this country. Mr. McNAB .- It might be a carpenter work- ing on a building. Sir J. G. WARD .- All I can say is that the clashing ought to be avoided so far as the Second Schedule of the Bill is concerned ; and when the Bill has passed its second reading I will have the matter looked into with a view of seeing in what way the difficulty, under ordinary circum- stances, can be overcome. I have no doubt. 
<page:411>
tional implied covenant being put in the Sche- dule. As to the point raised by the honourable member for Bruce, regarding a joint insurance by the mortgagee and mortgagor, the honourable gentleman will see that there is a clause in this Bill where the option is given to a per- son to contract outside the terms of the Sche- dule entirely, and in that case a joint insurance by the mortgagee and mortgagor can be effected if they so desire. But I may say the almost universal practice now is for the insurance to be in the name of the mort- gagee, and it is the best one. But if there are people who have an interest in properties such as the honourable member refers to, and who desire to insure in the joint names of the mortgagor and mortgagee, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent them from doing it. On the contrary, subclause (2) of clause 3 makes pro- vision for it exactly as the honourable member desires. Sir, while honourable members have treated this Bill with fairness, and have given every credit to the honourable member for Waitaki, who was its author, I am surprised to find some of them seem to dissent from the Government having taken up a Bill which had already been passed in this House two or three times on former occasions, and which had been before the Statutes Revision Committee. think it is the duty of the Government of the day, when private members have been success- ful in getting measures through the House more than once, to assist those members in getting their measures placed on the statute-book, as a member in his private capacity has not the same facilities for doing it as the Government itself has. If, Sir, as suggested-jocularly, I think-by the honourable member for Christchurch City (Mr. Smith) it is undignified for the Government to take up private members' Bills, then all I can say is that other honourable members may some day find themselves in the position of having passed a measure two or three times through this House and yet not having suc- ceeded in getting it on the statute-book. They will, under these circumstances, no doubt be glad to avail themselves of what assistance the Government may be able to give them. In Committee I shall be very glad to give careful consideration to any suggestions honourable members may have to make. Bill read a second time. # HOSPITAL NURSES REGISTRATION BILL. Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) .- I think, Sir, that this Bill will com- mend itself to honourable members. It has seemed strange that while we insist upon people in other callings having the necessary qualifications and experience, nothing has been done in the direction in which this measure goes. We insist that no man shall work as a surveyor until he has been licensed, nor can others engage in a seafaring life until they are proved to be competent, and so in several other professions until they can procure portant matter of attending to the sick, how- ever, no means are at present provided by the State to enable those engaged in this profession to produce evidence of their ability to carry out their important duties. The object of this Bill is to provide for the registration of those who at present possess the necessary qualifica- tions and of those who may hereafter be- come qualified. Each year those registered would have their names published in the Gazette, and any one requiring the services of .a nurse could make sure of getting a competent nurse by a reference to this list. The Bill is not a lengthy one, and the clauses. explain themselves. Its one object is to pro- vide for the registration of hospital-trained nurses in New Zealand. There is no inten- tion to interfere with any competent per- son at present acting as a nurse. The Bill provides that hospital - trained nurses now qualified may become registered upon pro- ducing evidence of their fitness. Clause 2 defines " hospital" as a public hospital within the meaning of " The Hospitals and Charitable Institutions Act 1885 Amendment Act, 1886." Section 3 provides for the registration of nurses, and that a copy of the register shall be published in the Gazette annually in the I month of January. Subclause (1) of clause 4 deals with the case of those who have been trained in the larger hospitals that issue certificates, and provides for their registra- tion under certain conditions ; subclause (2) provides for the examination of those who have served in the smaller hospitals, but who produce a certificate of four years' training ; and subclause (3) deals with the cases that may arise after the passing of the Act. Those- whom it affects will require to have three years' training as a nurse in a hospital, together with systematic instruction in theo- retical and practical nursing, and must pass an examination from time to time held by examiners appointed under the Act. Sub- clause (4) provides for the registration, under certain conditions, of certificated nurses coming from other places. The remaining clauses are the machinery clauses required to give effect to the provisions of the Bill. I beg to move the second reading of the Bill. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce). - I do not know exactly what the object of this Bill is. One object of registration nowadays is to protect the public, and when I read the title of this. Bill I assumed that its object was to pro- vide that the public should be secured against bad nursing ; that nobody should be placed in the hands of incompetent nurses. But, in my opinion, it does not protect the public at all, and is useless, and is as so much waste-paper. In fact, it is rather worse than that, because it imposes certain conditions upon those who expect to become good nurses, which conditions may or may not be fulfilled. If they complied with its provisions they would certainly be able to wear their badge ; but if the Minister desires to better the condition of those who are at present hospital nurses he ought to go a step. 
<page:412>
qualified be allowed to nurse. The Bill would then have some effect. The Bill provides for an examination and for registration. In one case it provides that every person who has had four years' training as a nurse in a hospital, and has passed an examination in theoretical and prac- tical nursing by examiners appointed by the Go- vernor under this Act, is entitled to registration. And then we come to the curious case of those who, after the 1st January, 1902, hold a certificate as having had three years' training as nurse in a hospital - these may also be registered, but without examination. Perhaps the Minister may say that the certificate gained in this case is equal to the examination. I do not know that it would be. I am referring to section 4, which provides that nurses may be registered without examination ; while in the other case although a nurse may have served four years she has to pass an examination. hold that if the examination is good in the one case it is good in the other. The Bill does not provide that although a nurse may be registered either she or the public is to receive any benefit. Of course, the Minister may argue that the fact of the nurse being registered would be sufficient inducement for the public to employ her. That may or may not be so. If the Minister wishes to do any real good he ought to go further. Although in two cases those desiring to be registered have to pass an examination, the Bill goes on to say that a certificate given after the passing of the Act by the medical officer of any hospital shall not entitle the holder thereof to registration unless a course of at least twenty- five lectures have been delivered in that hospi- tal. I go further, and say there ought to be some kind of reward, and yet there is no re- ward in the Bill. What are these twenty-five lectures to be ? I dare say the regulations will provide for that; but who is to deliver them, and will they be paid for delivering them ? All these things, no doubt, are Committee objec- tions, but at least they deserve consideration. And when the nurse gets on the register what does she get? She gets a certificate, and the privilege of wearing a badge on her arm. But what is the good of it ? I do not see the good of it at all; and I hope the Minister will go further with his Bill, and say that no nurse whatever shall serve the public as a nurse un- less she has a badge on her arm, and a certifi- cate in her pocket, and then we shall under- stand where we are. But, as it is, this Bill means nothing. It says there shall be a regis- ter of nurses, that the registered nurse is to be subject to certain penalties if she does not do certain things ; but the nurse who is not regis- tered, I suppose, is free to do as she pleases. What are these penalties ? " Any registered nurse who is convicted of any indictable offence, or is proved to be guilty of misconduct, is liable to have her name erased from the register by order of the Governor in Council." Poor nurse. And then, I suppose, she becomes a common nurse, and not a registered nurse. Of course, there is the usual provision at the end Mr. J. Allen nurses are to be paid into the Consolidated Fund. I do not know whether this is another means of assisting the Consolidated Fund, but I do not think it will assist it. It is a worthless piece of legislation and not worth going to a second reading, and it is a matter of no conse- quence whether it goes on the statute-book or not. But for a Government that talks about having the power of initiation to bring down a Bill of this sort, to my mind, is absurd. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston). - It is a satis- factory thing to find that the Ministry is re- cognising the necessity of providing some means for the examination and registration of nurses. While there is a great deal in what the honour- able member for Bruce said against the Bill, I think the measure can be easily improved so as to make it a useful Act. In the first place, the provisions about what I may call the service certificates are not very clear. It is evident, by I subclause (1) of clause 4, that it is the intention to issue certificates to nurses who have served a certain time in public hospitals when they can get a certificate of competency from the head- nurse or the matron. It is not very clear from the wording whether they would have to pass an examination as well, and I think the Minis- ter might amend the Bill by making that plain. He might go a step further - not as far as the member for Bruce says, but, still, a little further than he has gone-by providing, in the first place, that the authorities of public hospitals in the colony shall give preference of employment to registered nurses. It would give some inducement to nurses to qualify for examination and registration, and by assuring them that, at any rate, they would have the pre- ference of public employment over nurses who are not qualified in the same way. If the Minister would consider these two points he would improve the Bill very much, and it would be of some use. I certainly think there should be some system by which the public could be satisfied that all nurses are fully qualified ; but I doubt whether any member of the House is prepared to go to the length of saying that any nurse who has not passed the examination or got the certificate provided for in the Bill shall not be employed. Mr. BOLLARD (Eden) .- I think this is a very useful Bill, and one that should have been placed on the statute-book years ago. The Bill will provide for a long-felt want if it is passed into law, inasmuch as there will be a register of properly qualified nurses, and when persons require the services of a nurse to attend any ailing member of their family they will be able to go to the register or to the Gazette and find out who are duly qualified and who are not. Now, there is a great difference in the examina- tions passed by nurses in this colony. In the hospitals of the four large centres the training provided for the nurses is very much superior to the training obtainable in the hospitals of the smaller boroughs throughout the colony. The four larger hospitals are affiliated, or the training there is affiliated, to the British Nurses. Association, and these are the only hospitals in 
<page:413>
the colony that are in this position, so far as I know. In the Auckland Hospital, for in- stance, the nurses undergo a three years' course of training, and at the end of each year they have to pass an examination before a Board of doctors, and at the end of the third year they have to pass a very severe examination before a Board of doctors. And if they succeed in passing they get a certificate of competency signed by the whole of the honorary medical staff, and by the Hospital Board, and by the matron or head-nurse, as mentioned by the honourable member for Palmerston. Now, Sir, the nurses who go through the four large hospitals are in a very much better position with regard to their certificate as nurse than the nurses in the smaller hospitals. The nurse who goes through the Auckland Hospital, for instance, obtains a certificate that gives her a status in any of the British dominions as a duly qualitied nurse. The nurses trained at the Thames or the Waikato Hospital, for in- stance, are not in the same position. Mr. McGOWAN .- They may be much su- perior nurses. Mr. BOLLARD .- It does not matter. You take the case of a man who is supposed to be a veterinary surgeon. Unless he has got the necessary diploma he has no standing. You know that very well. Consequently, the nurses who are trained in the smaller hospitals have not the same chance with the medical pro- fession and with the British Nurses' Association as those who are trained in the four larger hospitals that I have mentioned. This Bill pro- vides that nurses trained at the smaller hos- pitals will have to undergo an examination before a Board of doctors, I presume, and if they succeed in passing that examination, then the Bill provides they should be placed in exactly the same position as nurses who have gone through the larger hospitals. I think it is a very useful measure, and one that will be of very great value to the public, inasmuch as the public will be in the position to know, if they unfortunately require nurses for the mem- bers of their families, where they may get duly qualified nurses. Such a provision is not made at present, and the public therefore cannot tell who are qualified and who are not qualified as nurses. It is a very good Bill, and I intend to support it. Mr. GRAHAM (Nelson City) .- I just want to say a word or two on this Bill. I think it is a very good Bill, and that it is going in the right direction. It will inspire increased con- fidence in the minds of people who have to place themselves in the hands of nurses, which many unfortunate people have to do. With reference to subclause (1) of clause 4, if there is any doubt, as suggested by the honourable member for Palmerston, as to whether the nurses who already hold certificates and have received systematic instruction in theoretical and practical nursing will have to pass another examination to entitle them to registration, I think that should be made clear, if it is not already clear. It appears to me that 5.0. the nurses do not have to undergo another examination. It is provided that thev have to prove " that during her training she re- ceived systematic instruction in theoretical and practical nursing from the medical officer and matron." Mr. PIRANI .- How will they prove it ? Mr. GRAHAM .- They can prove it by pro- ducing a certificate from the medical officer or the matron, or from the Hospital records. Another subclause dealing with the same thing under different conditions says, "and passes an examination." It appears to me, therefore, that it is not intended that they should pass another examination in the case mentioned in subclause (1). At any rate, I am of opinion that the point should be made clear as io whether that is the intention of the Bill as it now stands. With reference to subclause (1), I desire also, Sir, to say something about the time allowed to nurses to register. Nurses are to be enabled to register under this clause on payment of a fee of 10s., provided they make application to the Registrar on or before the 30th June, 1902; and I wish to point out that unless that provision is amended it will do an injustice to a con- siderable number of New Zealand nurses who may not be able to make application on account of their absence from the colony. They are absent, I may say, on a national duty. As the Minister himself knows, a number of trained nurses, who served for years in some of the principal hospitals of the colony, went in their official capacity to South Africa. They are, of course, gaining further experience there, and on their return to New Zealand, which may happen to be after the 30th June next, they will, unless the Bill is amended, be re- quired to undergo all the unnecessary trouble of passing another theoretical as well as practi- cal examination. I consider that would not, under the circumstances, be fair to them. I know several nurses from my own district who are now on duty in South Africa. One is the daughter of one of the Government " Whips" of this House. She is an excellently trained nurse. I know several other experienced and competent nurses in the same position, who have also had a long course of training. Now, I wish to point out to the Minister that this Bill, as drawn, would really prevent those nurses from registering under the conditions of subclause (1). I know they do not intend to come back to New Zealand until their services are no longer required in South Africa. That may mean that they will return to the colony after the 30th of June next. I want to ask the Minister whether he will agree to an amendment of the Bill to enable these nurses to take advan- tage of subclause (1) just the same as if they were in New Zealand now. With that excep- tion, I see nothing at all in the Bill to disagree with. I consider it is a step in the right direc- tion, and it is one that, I am sure, will be appreciated by the public, and lead to a con- siderable amount of public confidence in nurses who are registered as compared with those who are unregistered. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Justice) .- Sir, I 
<page:414>
would like to say a word or two to correct a wrong impression that might arise from the remarks of the honourable member for Eden in regard to the registration of the nurses of the larger hospitals which are affiliated with those of Great Britain. What the honourable gentle- man says is quite true, but it might be thought from the honourable gentleman's statement that the nurses in these hospitals were superior to those in the smaller institutions. Now, such is The smaller institutions not the fact at all. also have examinations, carried out periodically, and it is by no means proved that the nurse is any the better because she is trained in one of the large institutions. The large hospitals produce a large number of nurses, and the likelihood is that after they have served three years they go to some other institution ; they do not remain long in one position, as they do in smaller institutions. In the smaller hospitals of the colony the same nurses have been engaged for years. They could hold a position in any hospital in the colony, and yet they have not a certificate that will enable them to practise their profession in the Old Country, as they have not served in institutions that are affili- ated with the older hospitals. The result is that these nurses undergo an examination that is often more severe than that carried out in the larger hospitals. A number of people attend the larger hospitals for the purpose of receiving certificates, while they attend the smaller ones for the purpose of obtaining a livelihood. Some of the very best nurses in the colony are so employed. I simply wished to make these few remarks, Sir, to correct an impression that I thought might get abroad on account of the remarks made by the honour- able member for Eden. Mr. BOLLARD (Eden). - Sir, I wish to make a personal explanation. It was not my inten- tion to speak in any way disrespectfully of the nurses who are trained in the smaller hospitals. I wished to point out that in a hospital that is affiliated, such as the Auckland Hospital and as the other hospitals of the large centres are, the nurses have the "hall mark " on them when they get their certificates, and they do not require to undergo any extra examination. But in the smaller hospitals they will have to undergo an examination before they can be registered. I do not mean to say they are not equal. As I pointed out, a person may be very clever in her profession, but if she has not the necessary diploma she has no standing. Take, for instance, the nurses of the Thames Hospital : they may wish to get into the Auck- land Hospital, but, notwithstanding that they may be very clever, they would have to com- mence at the lowest rung of the ladder and go through the whole course before they would be duly qualified. I do not wish to in any way disparage the nurses of the smaller hospitals. Mr. LAURENSON (Lyttelton). - I wish to express my satisfaction with the Bill which the Minister has introduced, and I trust it will become law this session. As things are now, any woman can set herself up as a nurse, and she then assumes to herself the same status as Mr. McGowan a woman who may possess qualifications that entitle her to rank almost as a doctor. We know, of course, that a thoroughly trained woman, who has had experience and theoretical training, is in many cases better than a doctor. I was struck with some remarks made by the member for Bruce. He said the Bill was a small one, and not worthy of the Government. Sir, I consider it is the small things of life that are in most cases the most important things and the cause of the most far-reaching effects, and I hope the Government will not be discouraged in introducing measures of this nature simply because remarks of that kind are made by honourable members. It shows to what straits our old friends Betsy Prig and Sairey Gamp have been reduced when their only champion in the House is the mem- ber for Bruce. For myself, I sincerely trust that the day when the nurse made her appear- ance in a plaid shawl, with a bottle of gin under her arm, has passed and gone for ever, and that we have come once for all to the days when nurses shall be thoroughly trained women, who shall hold diplomas, and be paid in propor- tion. The suggestion by the honourable mem- ber for Palmerston is an excellent one, that when, for the future, nurses are appointed to our hospitals they shall be, with the exception of a small number of probationers-which number can be defined later on-in every case women holding diplomas under this Act. There are certain clauses I should like to see altered, but these can be altered in Committee. I am pleased to see the Bill brought in, and I hope it will go through without a division. Mr. T. MACKENZIE (Waibemo) .- Sir, the last speaker was rather unjust to the member for Bruce. He did not in any way rise up to advocate the old system of nursing which caused so much pain and suffering to past generations ; he merely stated that he did not recognise any necessity for the Bill in its present form. He did not advocate, as the honourable member for Lyttelton said, nurses of the style of Sairey Gamp and Betsy Prig. I do not, however, agree with the honourable member for Bruce in the statement that the Bill is not necessary. I think it is highly necessary, and had the honourable gentleman studied the very able report of Dr. MacGregor on the development of nursing he would see that the time has quite arrived for some system of training and classi- fication in order to secure proper nurses in our hospitals and for private nursing. He makes this clear. He refers to the old Sairey Gamp, but he goes on to say that already the lady style of nurse has passed away, and that women who go in for nursing now do so purely as a question of wage-earning, and how they can make a living. He states that a number of them are becoming mechanical and are growing hard, and not giving that attention to the minor details of nursing that is necessary. I am glad to think the Inspector has taken this view, because I know in some hospitals in this country patients do not receive the atten- tion they ought to receive from the nurses. Although the old Sairey Gamp type may have 
<page:415>
women who go in for this occupation and do not give that attention that patients are justified in expecting, nor what they would get from a homely elderly woman. I consider not only that they should receive a proper training, but in the selection of nurses suitable women of kind disposition should be selected. Dr. Mac- Gregor says the staff have often not the oppor- tunity of getting the best nurses. Very often members of the Hospital Boards insist on their friends being appointed, and this brings in the old wretched system that dominates everything in this country-the system of billet-hunting. This is not only prevalent in connection with Government departments, which, as every mem- ber knows, is the curse of the House-I venture to maintain that three-quarters of a member's correspondence is occupied by billet-hunters, and every kind of pressure is brought to bear on members to use influence with Ministers to get people into the Government service. I want to mention a case of indifferent nursing that has come under my notice in the Dunedin Hospital. An old man-a Highlander-went into the hospital and had an operation per- formed ; this occurred in the men's ward, and he received very kind treatment from the men nurses. After a time he became ill again, and was again admitted to the hospital, and, al- though he was not very ill, he, however, be- came worse. He told me he was not receiving proper attention ; he was suffering from an extremely painful bladder complaint, and he  told me he was often neglected by the nurses. I thought he might have exaggerated a little ; he told me he suffered intense pain and some- times at night groaned a little, and they threat-    ened to turn him out, and on one occasion he said they struck him. He several times asked me if they could turn him out at night, and I assured them they could not. However, I was there one day when he was in great agony, and he told me they had removed all the conveni- ences such as ought to be there for a man in his painful condition. In consequence of this he had complained and received very severe treatment from the nurses. I became very indignant, and spoke very strongly of such treatment when one considered what the in- stitution cost the country. Two nurses were attending at the bed close by, and one of them came and said I ought not to listen to all he said. I replied that I had evidence of absolute neglect - that certain utensils ought to be there and were not there. The nurse then said the doctor objected to them being there during the daytime, and I said, " Surely when a man is suffering intense agony the doctor should know they ought to be there ?" The nurse then observed that we could not say she had been unkind to him, and on my asking her name she said, "Miss Smith." I at once remarked that he had always told me of her great kindness to him. It was the others he complained about, all except Miss Macdonald, and later on he pointed to another nurse who he said was good. As I had to go out of town I rang up a friend of mine who was acquainted attending this man, to tell him of the neglect and to see to several matters. In the mean- time, however, the hospital nurses told their story to the doctor, and my friend told me that the doctor was very indignant that I should interfere, and wished to know who Tom Mackenzie was -he did not care for me nor for any one - and that I had no right to kick up a row in the hospital. My friend told him that he would see that Tom Mackenzie knew what he was about, and would see the patient got proper attention. The next time I saw this unfortunate patient he said the doctor had been there and that he had had a dreadful time. He had bullied him for complaining to me, and said that he cared nothing for Tom Mackenzie, et cetera. The man was reduced to a nervous condition. One could see that he would not recover. I wrote down his words, and I have corroboration for the statements I am making. He mentioned the names of the nurses who had been very kind to him-Miss Smith and Miss Macdonald. He was paying the cost of his own accommodation, and the indifferent attention he received was such as to be a very grave reflection on the conduct of the institu- tion. You may wonder why I did not report the matter; I told him I would have the matter attended to at once, but he implored me not to do so now, as he was there under their power and he would only suffer more. I had arranged to take him away, but he was too ill to be removed, and I promised him I would not mention the matter before he died. I do not say he may not have exaggerated a little ; but I was there and saw that he did not get the conveniences that were necessary. When we reflect that this hospital costs €8,000 a year, and there are no more than a hundred patients in the institution, and the local bodies contribute enormously to it, I say the people of the country ought to get kind treatment in the institution. No doubt there are very many cases of kindness; but I have heard. although the case was not brought forward, there were cases in Wellington and other hospitals where elderly men suffering from painful diseases of a sometimes unpleasant nature are not receiving kind attention from some of the nurses. The patient I refer to in Dunedin was one of the kindliest of men, and was one of nature's High- land gentlemen. I would not have it thought that anything like a majority of the nurses are indifferent to the patients. I believe the great majority of the nurses are extremely kind. But there are exceptions to this rule, and if Dr. MacGregor or Ministers succeeded in esta- blishing a proper system of training for our nurses, and also inquire whether or not those nurses are naturally kind and of such dispo- sition as to give attention to the patients, they will succeed in doing a very great kindness to the people of Now Zealand. Mr. J. W. THOMSON (Clutha) .- Sir, the honourable gentleman who has just sat down has referred to the report of Dr. MacGregor on hospitals. There is a good deal in the re- port about the employment of women as nurses, 
<page:416>
of the report that the Government have brought down this Bill. If so, they might have told us, because this might have had some weight with us in supporting the measure. The report is very interesting. It goes on to show that pre- vious to the Crimean War though women acted as nurses yet they were not trained as nurses. Since that time, however, they have been trained, and that is due to a great extent to the influence of Florence Nightingale. It is only in recent times, therefore, that we have had trained nurses following nursing as a profes- sion. It may be presumed that in nursing, as in other things, there are degrees of ability. There are, no doubt, good nurses and bad nurses ; it is therefore very desirable, both in the interests of the general public and of the nurses themselves, that the capacity of each woman who follows nursing as a profession should be ascertained. In this way efficiency may be expected to reap its due reward. Train- ing, however, is not everything in a nurse. She must have good sense, a kindly disposition, and many other virtues. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton) .- I think, Sir, this is capable of being made a good and useful measure. I think it is desirable that registration should be applied to nurses in order that the standard of the profession of nursing may be raised. What I do object to in this Bill is that it supplies registration only for one class of nurses, and that those whose lot has been cast in public hospitals will be placed in a superior position to other nurses, who may possibly have had an equally extensive experience of nursing, and who also may be thoroughly capable, but who would be pushed out in the race for occupation by those   who happen to be registered. That, I think, is a blot upon the Bill. In the colony there are a number of nurses who, as I have said, have been following the profession of nursing for a num- ber of years, and whom medical men employ from time to time. In many cases those nurses have attended the very excellent classes that are organized by the St. John Ambulance Society, have passed the examinations of that society, and have received certificates of proficiency. Apparently, unless they happen to have passed through a public hospital they are not entitled to register. Now, I sincerely hope, when the Bill is going through Committee, the Minister will be pre- pared to accept a new clause under which nurses who have not passed through hospitals, but who are able to pass any set examination that may be established under this Bill, and have had sufficient experience, shall be entitled to registration and to a certificate such as those nurses obtain who have passed through hos- pitals. I object very strongly to those parts of the Bill which levy a fee, in some cases of 10s. and in other cases of $1, for registration. 1 cannot understand why the Ministry should feel it necessary to impose so large a sum on a young woman just starting in life as a nurse. If the Government were to charge some small sum, such as half a crown, it would be quite Mr. J. W. Thomson expense that will be involved ; because, having now a large Public Health Department, which employs a highly trained officer as its head, and district officers, who are medical men, it will be quite possible for the Government to obtain sets of examination-papers without paying large sums in the shape of fees to the examiners. I cannot therefore understand why the Govern- ment should demand so large a sum as £1 for registration. With regard to the general prin- ciple of improving the status of nurses, I think honourable members will agree that it is desirable, once this system of registration has been adopted, to extend the principle to some extent to the female attendants at lunatic asylums and other public institutions, because I find that in the Bill the word " Hos- pital " is defined as meaning only a public hos- pital. Now, I think the Hon. the Minister in charge of the Bill will know that there are a number of very excellent private hospitals of very high standing in Christchurch and Dun- edin and other centres. Some of them, I believe, are in some respects superior to most of the public hospitals so far as their appointments are concerned, and I think it would be exceedingly unfair that women who have been employed as nurses in these private hospitals for years should not be entitled to register in the same way as those who have passed through public hospitals. Speaking generally, I think the underlying prin- ciple of registering nurses is a useful one. The introduction of this Bill may not be evidence of any great amount of Ministerial initiative, which the honourable member for Bruce de- plored, but it evidences initiative in a certain direction, and it is possible, now that initiative has broken out in matters of social legislation, that it may grow, and we may have progressive developments of it. We have had a great deal of initiative in regard to land legislation, finance, and taxation, and a number of other things, and I welcome a further development in this direc- tion. I shall support the second reading of the Bill, but I hope the Minister will agree to the registration-fee being reduced to 2s. 6d. I hope, also, he will agree that the advantages of regis- tration shall be extended to those nurses who are outside the ordinary public hospitals. Mr. COLLINS (Christchurch City). - With the honourable gentleman who has just sat down, I congratulate the Government on having introduced this Bill, and, with him. I regret that the present scope of the Bill will exclude a number of nurses who, perhaps, are quite as well qualified for the position of nurses as those who have passed through our public hospitals. Not that I have one word to say in disparagement of the nurses in our public hospitals, because I believe they will compare favourably with those doing similar work in any part of the world, but the interpretation clause distinctly excludes all private hospitals through- out the colony. Now, speaking of one of those institutions at any rate -- the one with which I am best acquainted, the Strathmore Private Hospital-I can say that it is a model of scientific perfection, and that the nurses 
<page:417>
qualitied for the work as are those nurses who are trained at the public institutions. This is proved by the fact that those nurses are in great demand amongst the medical faculty in the City of Christchurch. Then, of course, I know there are other well-conducted hospitals in the colony, but, in connection with this particular one, I would point out that for several vears the operatingroom in this institu- tution has been regarded as a model. I know that even in England operating rooms are being built and arranged on the model of that at Strathmore Hospital, in Christchurch. There is only one other matter to which 1 7.30. would like to refer, and it is the regis- tration-fee - the proposal that those who are entitled shall be registered upon the payment of a fec of £1. I feel that this is a matter of some importance, and I should like to see the fee abolished altogether; but, at any rate, the amount of the fee should surely be considerably reduced. I cannot for the life of me ima- gine why the Government should wish to make revenue from the registering of nurses. The number may be considerable, and, if so, the amount might be considerable; but this registration will put the Government to no expense, it will not require any additional staff of officers, and, while acceding to the demand of their own Inspector-General for a standard of training among our hospital nurses, and for those who act as nurses generally, I cannot understand why the Government should impose such a registration-fee as to make it appear. . although I do not know that it is so --- that the Government desire to make revenue by this Bill. I hope the Government will see their way very materially to reduce the amount of the regis- tration-fee: and if they will do that I feel quite sure the Bill itself will confer very great benefit not only on the nurses themselves, but upon the community which those nurses with so much benefit so ungrudgingly serve. I should like to say before I sit down that when the Bill gets into Committee I shall take the opportunity of moving such amendments as will give effect to the suggestions I have noted in my remarks. Mr. ARNOLD (Dunedin City) .- Sir. I wish in the first place to congratulate the Minister upon bringing down this Bill, which, I think, is in the right direction. It is well that we should encourage, especially in those who minister to the necessities of others, a spirit of emulation in that which tends to the welfare of the community; and I think if there is one calling more than another in which it is well that we should equal if not surpass other colonies and other countries it is in connection with the training of nurses. I think that the fact of nurses passing an examination and having registration certificates will cause them to study well, will cause them to practice well their noble calling, and will cause them to strive to rise higher and to excel to a greater degree than they would do otherwise. There- fore I am pleased that the Ministry has brought down this Bill, and I intend to vote for the second reading of it. Sir, it was VOL. CXVII .- 26. ment made by the honourable member for Waihemo, Mr. Mackenzie, this afternoon that 1 rose to speak at all. During the last two ses- sions that honourable gentleman has made one or two very strong and severe statements with regard to Dunedin and its surroundings. Last session we had what I call a very exaggerated statement with regard to the harbour, and I certainly expected that it would have been taken notice of by the Harbour Board before now ; and not many days ago, in this House, we had a severe statement made by him with re- gard to the Municipal Council in connection with their management of and the state of the Water of Leith. Such a statement should be treated with the contempt it deserves both by the Council and the members for the city. To- day we had, however, a statement which we cannot deny, because it is impossible for us to disprove it, and it seems to have been made in all good faith. It is, however, so serious that I cannot let it pass unnoticed. We were told that in an institution which I am proud of, and which is one of the largest hospitals in the colony-we are proud of all our hospitals-I say we were told that in the Dunedin Hospital a man suffer- ing very keenly was not only neglected by one of the trained nurses of that institution, but was also abused and punished by that nurse. Not only did the statement go that far, but we were told also that the doctor when spoken to upheld what had been done, and stated that an out- sider-that is, the honourable member - had no right to interfere. If the statement be correct I can hardly find words to express my feelings with regard to it. I say. if it be true, an inquiry should have been held and an ex- posure made publicly. On the other hand, if it is not true, the statement should be denied publicly. We have had Royal Commissions to inquire into charges made against our public institutions of less importance than this. The honourable member says that he makes the statement on the authority of the patient him- self. We know that there may be those in our hospitals who at times suffer keenly, and who imagine that the treatment they receive is not kind when it is the best they could receive under the circumstances. But the member him- self says he saw that which pointed to neglect- that is to say, certain appliances or conveniences were not there which he himself knew should be there for the patient. Sir, that is going farther than a mere statement of the patient ; but it seems to me that what is more serious still is the statement that, at the request of the patient, the honourable member promised that he would not mention the matter until the patient had passed away from this life, intend- ing to show to this House that the treatment would be even more unkind if it were known that he had spoken to any outsider about the matter. I refer to this matter now so that I may in the first place lay emphasis upon the statement made by the member for Waihemo. If it is found that it is not correct, the autho- rities in Dunedin can note it, and, I hope, cause the member to be more careful in the future. 
<page:418>
have had considerable experience myself of it, for the reason that Iam continually meeting the nurses, the visitors, and patients that at differ- ent times have passed through the institution, and I can say this : that during my experience of some sixteen or seventeen years I have not come in contact with one patient who has been dismissed from that institution but that has spoken in the highest terms of the kindly treat- ment that they have received, and of the manner that they have been attended to I have heard very many say that they have been better attended to than they possibly could have been in their own homes. They have been thankful, -though unwilling to enter the hospital in the first place, as some people are biassed against such institutions - that they had entered that institution in their sickness. As I said in my opening remarks, although the member's state- ment will be circulated as a fact, vet I certainly think he must have been deceived by the state- ment made to him by the patient, and that the statement he made here this afternoon was either exaggerated by the person who communi- cated with him, or that he is now exaggerating for the purpose of speaking at all times against the city, which is next to the borough of which he is the Mavor. I think we might expect the honourable member to speak kindly of the City of Dunedin and its institutions, instead of, as he does, taking every oppor- tunity of discrediting everything in connec- tion with it. Sir, that was my chief reason for rising to speak this evening. But, coming back to the Bill, I think it is a good measure, and that it will result in the nurses being better trained, and, consequently, better able to follow their calling than they otherwise would be.   Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) .- I did not read the paper of Dr. MacGregor, spoken of by the honourable member for Waihemo, but experience teaches me that nurses, like poets, are born, not made. The setting-up of a nurses' guild such as is proposed by this Bill may in- crease the status of the nurses, but it cannot increase their ability. Then, there is the objec- tion that the establishment of a nurses' guild may lead to the exclusion of very many experi- enced nurses who may not be able to pass some set cram test. There are many women in this country - many within my own knowledge- who might not be able to pass a skilled profes- sional examination, and yet I know them to be most efficient and capable nurses. The setting- up of a guild such as this would possibly exclude them. They are not of the "Sairey Gamp" class. They are women who have world wide experience of the ills not only of their own sex, but of the other sex. When the skilled aid of the physician has reached its limit and is of no further avail, then comes into play the natural talent of the skilled nurse. The nurse then in reality takes the place of the doctor. As to the exclusion of experienced women who would be barred by the setting-up of this insti- tution of skilled nurses, I want to know how that objection is to be met. for in serious or critical cases the medical profession naturally Mr. Arnold nurses' guild, and on that list will not be found the names of very many women whose names I hold ought to be there. Then, a further possi- bility of exclusion is contained in the imposition of the fee. I agree with those members who ask, Why should there be a fee when the whole object is to aid and minimise the sufferings under which the hospital patient or any other patient labours? I have said that the tender care of a woman, her sympathy, her watchful- ness in really dangerous cases of sickness. is frequently more to the patient than the aid of the physician himself. Could the tenderness and sympathy of a woman be better expressed than in the beautiful lines of Sir Walter Scott's " Marmion " ?-- " Ob. woman, in our hour of ease Uncertain. roy, and hard to please. And variable as the shade By the light quivering aspen made : When pain and anguish wring the brow A ministering angel thou." Sir, I do not, like Mr. Silas Wegg, drop into poetry in a mechanical way, but I recognise in those concluding lines the expression of a feel- ing which I. on very many occasions, have seen manifested by women who take an interest in their work as nurses, not for the payment they receive, but from the instinctive nature within the m which prompts them to lend whatever aid they can to a suffering fellow-being in a willing and whole-hearted way. Well, Sir, I ask whether the honourable gentleman has considered the two classes-the claims of the trained, qualified, and certificated nurses who will have all the standing pertaining to the profession-for it will be raised to the dignity of a profession- and the claims of those who, on the other hand, will be equally qualified, but who will perhaps be barred from being called on in cases where their skill would be of the greatest. use to the patient. I have known of guilds that have had conferred upon them powers of exclusion, where there were men excluded equally, and in many cases better qualified, than those who had become members of those guilds. I hardly see how that objection is to be met. I am glad to see there is no disqualifica- tion in the Bill. There is nothing which says that a person shall be barred from acting as a paid nurse notwithstanding that she is not possessed of a certificate from the institution. But I again call attention to the fact that it is a difficulty-a bar-in the case of those quali- fied women who may not be able to pass an examination, whose names will therefore not be on the certificated list, and whose names will therefore not be recommended by members of the medical profession, but who in many ways may be superior to some of those nurses who happen to have the badge and the attire of professional trained nurses. 1 do not wish to say one word in derogation of the pro- fessional nurses employed in our hospitals. While one may say a great deal in commenda- tion of their services to the public of this country, it is not to be forgotten that many of them perform their duties in what one may 
<page:419>
in the wards; bat, as in the case of all other occupations, there are many extremely well qualified to occupy the position, whereas, on the other hand, there are many who are not. This is what may be called the mechanical view of the question. The honourable gentle- man is entitled to all credit for having brought in the Bill. It is not marked by such a degree of perfection as I should like to see attach to a Bill of the kind, but, being designed in the best interests of those who suffer, nothing should be said in condemnation of it. Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) .- I have to thank honourable mem- bers for their remarks. With one exception, every member has expressed approval of the introduction of the Bill, and the one exception is the member for Bruce, who can see no good in the Bill, and no object in its being intro- duced, and regards it as so much waste paper. But I think when he listened to the speech of the honourable member for Eden, who so fully understands the subject, in consequence of the position he occupies on the Board in Auckland, he must have recognised that he said a great deal that he had better have left unsaid. There are difficulties in connection with this as with every other measure introduced. One difficulty has been referred to by the last speaker ; but, as he pointed out, it is not compulsory for any nurse to register under this Bill, and, as to the question of the experienced nurses who might not be qualified or have the necessary eram or  modern experience to enable them to obtain registration, the honourable gentleman, I think, supplied the answer. He said in some cases they were superior to the nurses who might have a certificate. The doctor would in most cases be the man who would have the selection of the nurse, and he would naturally recom- mend one who, in his opinion, was the best person to look after his patient. I think that is the solution that would present itself to any one. Mr. FISHER. - There are a few sick persons who believe in titles -- affixes and prefixes. Mr. HALL-JONES. - If that is so, then they could take their choice, the same as they would at the present time. When one considers that in many cases the doctor visits a patient but once each day, or every second day, and that the nurse is with the patient the whole time, it must be recognised there is necessity for the nurses being fully qualified to carry out the important duties they have to perform. With regard to the fees, I do not think they are too high. It is true, provision is made for the fees being paid into the Consolidated Fund : but the whole cost of the administration of the Act is to be paid out of the Consolidated Fund. An Hon. MEMBER. -- What expenses will there be ? Mr. HALL-JONES .- Fees have to be paid for examiners, and I may tell you that the fees indicated in the Bill will not be sufficient to meet these expenses ; and it must not be for- gotten that every year the names of the regis- At the same time the matter is so urgent and the necessity for registration of qualified nurses is so apparent, as to warrant the expenditure under the provisions of the Bill. An Hon. MEMBER. - How many do you expect to register ? Mr. HALL-JONES .- Of course, one cannot say, but suppose at first there are fifty ; it will be necessary to have these fifty examined, and you cannot get examiners unless you pay them. An Hon. MEMBER .- There might be five hundred. Mr. HALL-JONES .- Suppose there are five hundred, you will require so many more ex- aminers. It takes time, and you cannot get examiners unless they receive some fee. In some cases the staff of a hospital will be in a position to carry out the work of examination, but in other cases we shall have to appoint special examiners. The question raised by the honourable member for Christchurch City (Mr. Collins), the honourable member for Riccarton, and other members as to the position of the private hospitals is an important one, but the private hospitals do not come under inspection. If they came under inspection, and if the pro- prietors were prepared to conduct such esta- blishments with properly qualified persons. I should see no objection to their coming under the provisions of the Bill ; but at the present time the private hospitals are not under inspec- tion ---- An Hon. MEMBER. - They ought to be. Mr. HALL-JONES .- I believe they ought to be. I know that one in particular-at Christ- church-is one of the best hospitals in the colony- well built, well equipped, and well managed. But I will look into that matter before the Bill goes into Committee. The ques- tion was raised by the member for Palmerston that it should be compulsory for the Hospital Board to employ duly qualified nurses. These hospitals are under the control of the local bodies. That being the case, the representatives of the local bodies have a voice in their manage- ment; and I think it is better to leave the matter to the local representatives. If they think it desirable, they will insist on trained certificated nurses being employed. The Bill was understood by all honourable gentlemen with the exception of the member for Bruce. There is no doubt as to the meaning of the subclauses in clause 4. Mr. J. ALLEN .-- 1 was not doubtful. Mr. HALL-JONES .-- You did not give a proper interpretation of them. The 1st sub- clause of clause 4 provides that every person who holds a certificate of three years' training as a nurse in a hospital, and proves that she has received systematic instruction in theo- retical and practical nursing- An Hon. MEMBER .- Without examination. Mr. HALL-JONES .- If they give the proof they need not be examined. If they can pro- duce evidence that they have the necessary theoretical and practical knowledge they need not pass an examination. Subclause (21 applies to the smaller hospitals, and not to the large 
<page:420>
to the examinations to be held after the passing of the Act and for the coming year. Any rea- sonable suggestions made in Committee which will improve the Bill and make it a more useful measure I shall be only too pleased to consider. 1 beg to move the second reading. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL. - Will the 8.0. Minister explain what he proposes to do in regard to the point I raised as to allowing nurses who have not been in hospitals, but who are qualified, presenting themselves for examina- tion, so as to obtain certificates and registra- tion ? Mr. HALL-JONES .- That is a large ques- tion, because one might pass the necessary examination and not have had any experience. If they could show experience, and also pass the examination, that would solve the question of private nurses as well as that of nurses in private hospitals. Bill read a second time. PROMISSORY OATHS BILL. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Justice). - Sir, this is a very short Bill, and a few words will enable me to show the reason for its being introduced. The object of this Bill is to remedy a defect which has been found to exist. As honourable gentlemen know, there is a large number of gentlemen in country places occupy- ing the position of Justice of the Peace. The Commissions are regazetted with additions and alterations every two or three years, and this Bill is to provide that it shall not be necessary  that these gentlemen should be resworn - that, having taken the oath once, it shall not be necessary to have to go a good many miles to a Stipendiary Magistrate to do so again. Clause 2 enables us to get over that particular difficulty. Mr. MASSEY .- Is it necessary now ? Mr. McGOWAN .-- It is considered necessary now. There has been a difference of opinion about that very subject, but the Government has been advised that it is necessary. Some of the highest legal authorities have considered it necessary, while I believe some other authori- ties do not consider it so necessary. However, I believe it is much better to set the matter at rest by having the position properly defined in the statute law of the colony, so as to obviate any difficulty or trouble. There are in the colony, I suppose, some 2,600 Justices of the Peace, and it is a very serious matter to re- swear all those gentlemen, as well as those who are ex-officio Justices of the Peace, such as Mayors of cities and boroughs, and so on. We find it would be necessary for them to be re- sworn ; and when they have filled the position for a certain term I think it is unnecessary that they should be put to the trouble of being re- sworn, once having taken the cath. There is another difficulty-that is, under "The Justices of the Peace Act, 1882," a Justice cannot act unless he has taken the prescribed oaths, and it might lead to a good deal of trouble if, on the issue of a new Commission, no one whose name appeared thereon could legally act Mr. Hall-Jones might lead to some very serious conscanences ; and, in order to put the question beyond doubt, I think it will be wise to pass this Bill. Mom- bers will see that in clause 3 we are simply bringing into law what has hitherto beon the practice. It will be remembered that at the opening of the present session members were resworn, although some were of opinion that it was not necessary. Now, this simply makes what has hitherto been the practice the law : and the proviso says it shall not be necessary to call a special meeting of Parliament on the demise of the Crown. I think the Bill is ex- cecdingly simple, and, as it is asserted to be necessary, I move the second reading. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) .-- The Minis- ter nas given very good reasons for the introduc- tion of this Bill. It is quite conceivable, no doubt, that it is the advice of the honourable gentleman's legal advisers that the gentlemen holding Commissions of the Peace require to be resworn when a fresh Commission is issued. Apparently he is right, thon, in bringing in this Bill, but I hope a fresh clause will be added by which all the acts of these Justices who have not been sworn when they ought to have been sworn should be validated. Because if the Minister is advised that they ought to have been sworn before they can act-and we all know that a fresh Commission was issued lately on account of the demise of the Crown-it follows if they ought to have been resworn and they have not been resworn, and it is necessary to bring in an Act to rectify the omission, that there will have to be a clause put in validating all the acts of those Justices of the Peace who have not been sworn. I only call attention to this, because probably the very fact of this Bill being passed will create doubts in people's minds, and may give rise to legal actions as to the validity of the acts of these Justices. I hope the Minister will take the advice of the Law Officers on the matter, and see whether a validation clause is not necessary. I think, if you admit the principle that they ought to have been resworn, by bringing in a Bill, it will be quite arguable that they were never properly Justices of the Peace, and all acts done by them are illegal. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton). - Sir, I think the point raised by the honourable mem- ber for the Bay of Plenty is a very important one; but there is one other matter I wish to comment upon, and that is as to the constitu- tion of the Commission of the Peace itself. I cannot help thinking that the preparation from time to time of the Commission of the Peace lists must be done in a most slipshod manner. I noticed it was stated in the Wanganui papers at the time the last Commission was issued that a number of persons who had been dead for years were reappointed to the Commission of the Peace. The same thing happened in the Province of Canterbury. A number of persons in that part of the colony who were appointed had been dead for a number of years when the last appointments were made. It does seem a surprising thing that when a Commission is

take steps to revise the lists, with the view of eliminating from it those persons who are in- capable of fulfilling the duties. Another matter in the same connection that might be borne in mind is this : I believe it is the custom of the Government to hold over all recom- mondations that may be made in the way of Commissions of the Peace until some time, per- haps after a general election, and then a num- ber of appointments are made : and this fact, coming after a general election, gives the ap- pearance of these appointments being political, whereas I am sure in a very great number of cases they are not political at all. I think that if honourable members, or those who are quali- fied to recommend for the Commission of the Peace, were notified a month or two before- hand that the Government were going to issue - a Commission, they could supply the Govern- ment with lists of names of people they con- sider desirable. Speaking for my own district, I think it is necessary for perhaps five or six Justices of the Peace to be appointed in various parts of the electorate -- in fact, the public necessities require that this should be done. I was not aware that the Goverment were going to issue a new Commission after the general election, and consequently I missed the opportunity of sending in names I wished put on the Commission of the Peace. The appoint- ments I desired made were absolutely necessary for the convenience of the public, and I propose at an early date to make certain suggestions of appointment to the Commission of the Peace. I think it is extremely undesirable that these appointments should be held over for two or three years before being completed. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) .- Sir, the Minister told us that this was a Bill intended to remedy defects, and if there is any doubt as to whether Justices of the Peace should be resworn upon the issue of a new Commission it is necessary that the matter should be put right by legis- lation in the way that it is proposed to do in this Bill. But I want to tell the Minister of the peculiar experience of a Justice of the Peace in my clectorate some few years ago. By a mis- take on the part of the Justice Department his name was struck off the roll. I believe it was owing to the fact that a man of a similar name had died in the same district. However, this gentleman was struck off the roll, and he, in ignorance of the fact, went on performing the duties of a Justice of the Peace, sitting on the bench, and so forth. After the lapse of some two or three years the Justice Department discovered that a mistake had been made, and replaced his name on the roll. I want there- fore to know from the Minister, when he is replying, whether it is necessary for that gentleman to be resworn-whether he should have been resworn when his name was placed on the roll the second time, and what is his position, and whether this Bill is intended to apply to such cases. I want to indorse what has been said by the member for Riccarton with regard to the difficulty of getting suitable persons appointed as Justices of the Peace. So present time there are several large and im- portant districts which are absolutely without Justices of the Peace residing therein, and the residents are in consequence put to in- convenience. I have made recommendations to the Minister, but without much effect. I have made a suggestion now across the floor of the House, and I hope the matter will be attended to at the earliest possible opportunity. Mr. W. FRASER (Wakatipu) .- I think this Bill is a necessary one, and I shall support it. I want, however, to say a word or two with re- gard to the delay that often arises in the ap- pointment of Justices of the Peace. Great in- convenience arises from this fact : In districts where perhaps only one Justice resides, and that man happens to die, the district is then left entirely without the services of a Justice of the Peace. Unfortunately, when an applica- tion is made for a fresh appointment a delay sometimes extending to six months occurs. Why should this be so? I am not complain- ing of my requests for appointments being re- fused, but of the delay in giving effect thereto. In past years I remember that one or two persons used to be gazetted at a time. Nowa- days you have to wait a considerable time until a new Commission is issued. Let me assure the Minister that this delay causes very great inconvenience indeed, and I hope he will take the matter into his consideration. There is no reason why a Justice of the Peace should not be gazetted at once, when such appoint- ment has been shown to be necessary. I am sure my experience is that of many other mem- bers of the House. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Justice) .- I only wish to say, in regard to the case put by the honcurable member for Franklin, of a gentleman who some two or three years ago was struck off the list because he was supposed to be dead, and when it turned out afterwards that he was not dead he continued to act, if his name was struck off the list his decisions would be questioned, as he was not a Justice duly sworn. If he was reappointed, I imagine he ought to be resworn ; and this Bill would apply to every case of that kind. Then, the general question of the appointment of Justices of the Peace has been raised, and the honourable member for Wakatipu complained that after the death of a Justice of the Peace his suc- cessor was not appointed speedily enough. Now, I remember some years ago there was a good deal of comment in this House upon the Justices of the Peace throughout New Zealand. They were set upon not only by members of this House, but also by the Press of the colony. Sir, the Justices of the Peace are a body of men who do a great deal of useful and important public service, and very often get little thanks for it. It has always been my aim that only men well qualified for the position should be appointed, and I am not going to take the responsibility of appointing gentlemen to take the position of one who has died imme- diately on the death occurring. It is my duty to make some inquiries first, because it is 
<page:422>
only by inquiry that I am able to find gentle- men who will be a credit to the position and to themselves; and that is the only reason for the delay that takes place. In a young country there must always be these diffi- culties in regard to Justices of the Peace. In the first place, there are men whom the public are anxious should become Justices of the Peace, but who do not desire to fill the position. Those are generally the best men for the position. Then. there is another class of men who are anxious for the honour, which they should never get, and, unfortunately, those are the men who so often approach members of Parliament in order to get themselves appointed. Of course, a mem- ber of Parliament feels it his duty to speak to the Minister, and if he (the member) considers the applicant a fairly suitable man he recom- mends him for the position. It then becomes my duty to make inquiries, and if I find that the applicants are not satisfactory it is not my duty to appoint them. Mr. FISHER. - Who do you inquire through ? Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- A policeman. Mr. McGOWAN. - The honourable gentle- man, who is prepared to give a reply upon every question under the sun, has replied to the honourable member for Wellington City that I make inquiries from a policeman. I may tell him that I make inquiries from the proper source. If I did make inquiries from the wrong source, and if I make mistakes, members have every right to complain, and I am quite pre- pared to take the responsibility and bear the blame. Bill read a second time. YOUNG PERSONS PROTECTION BILL. Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) .- Sir, some two years ago we had a Bill very similar to the one now before the House, and, while it is called a Young Persons Protec- tion Bill, it actually means a Neglected Young Persons Protection Bill. Those who go through the streets of our cities and larger centres of population of an evening will have seen many cases of boys and girls of tender years prowling about the streets at unseemly hours. In many of these cases -- I venture to say, in most cases -the parents do not properly look after their children's welfare, and if the parents of these children neglect their duty we have a duty cast upon us, and that is to see that provision is made so that these children shall not be wan- dering about the streets getting into all sorts of trouble and mischief, and perhaps ruining their future lives. Sir, the Bill is very simple in its nature, and some of the objections which were made when the proposal was last before the House will not apply here, the matters objected to having been eliminated. This Bill has passed the Legislative Council, and comes to the House in almost a complete form. If the House were to accept the Bill as it is and pass it en bloc, I do not think it would go far wrong. Now, the simple pro- visions of the Bill are that a "young person " is defined as a boy or girl of fourteen years of age or under. I believe the last Bill fixed a Mr. McGowan higher age. The Bill only applies to certain districts where it is brought into operation by Order in Council, and the district must comprise a complete borough or a complete county, as the case might be. Then, the object of the Bill itself is contained in clause 5 : - "Where any Protection Officer finds any young person of either sex habitually loitering in the streets or out-of-the-way places at un- seemly hours (meaning thereby between nine o'clock at night and five o'clock in the morn- ing), and has reason to believe that such young person is there without proper control, or for immoral purposes, the following provision shall apply." Now. I venture to say there is not one mem- ber of this House who would suggest that a child under the age of fourteen years should be in the streets at these hours and without proper control, or there for immoral purposes, and not one but would try to save the children from that to which such conduct would lead. Well, in the event of a child being found there, the matter is one for the Protection Officer to deal with. These officers may be men or women. For a first offence a child is taken home to its parents, and the parents are made acquainted with the fact that the child was out at these late hours, or was doing something wrong. If when first questioned the child gives a satisfactory explanation, the child is allowed to go; but, if the Protection Officer is not satisfied, he then takes the child home and reports the matter to the parents. For a second offence a young person is taken to a place called a "shelter." It would be improper to take them to gaol, and a shelter would be a place provided for the purpose. It might be a building specially set apart, or a part of some building used for some other purpose, to allow of the children being lodged there until such times as other arrangements can be made. For the second offence, when the child is taken to the shelter, and if the person in charge of the shelter and the Protection Officer concur, the child may be detained there until it can be brought before a Magistrate. That would only be done in serious cases, or in cases where it would be wrong to allow the child to be taken to its home-for instance, where the parents were not well conducted and the child would not be properly looked after. Then the child would be retained at the shelter, and. according to the circumstances, dealt with by the Magis- trate. For a second offence the officers might not deem it necessary to bring the child before a Magistrate; it might be taken home to its parents the same as for a first offence ; but for subsequent offences provision is made that a child taken to the shelter must be de- tained there until brought before a Magistrate. There are simple provisions in the Bill with regard to the "shelter " and the Protection Officers, the age of the children, and the offences for which they may be taken to the shelter or dealt with otherwise. Section 6 provides that any Protection Officer may search premises where he has reason to believe children are harboured for immoral purposes. 
<page:423>
object to that provision. Clause 7 provides the procedure when young persons are detained in a shelter; and clause 8 provides that in aggravated cases not only is the child to be brought before a Magistrate, but the parent also is to be summoned to appear before the Magistrate, who is to deal with cases where the parent is responsible for the child having be- come uncontrollable, and, under this, parents will be liable to extreme penalties if they do not as far as lies in their power provide for the children under their control conducting themselves properly. Clause 11 provides power to search for boys apparently under seventeen years of age who frequent places known to be oc- cupied by immoral persons and where gambling is carried on. They will be dealt with ina similar way to that adopted in the case of boys of tender years, with the exception that they will be brought before a Magistrate. That will happen only in the case of their being found in houses frequented by prostitutes or in gambling- dens. Clause 12 provides that any parent or guardian of a girl under the age of eighteen years knowingly allowing her to visit for any immoral purpose any such premises as are referred to in section 6 shall be liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years. The remaining clauses of the Bill are machinery clauses to give effect to the part of the Bill already referred to. Honourable members who have studied this question will recognise that there is necessity for something being done in this direction. If the matter is not taken in hand we shall, in the near future, see the bad effects on the youth of the colony as they ad- vance in life. Mr. WILFORD (Wellington Suburbs) .- I agree with the principle of this Bill, but I ob- ject to certain of its provisions. One has only to look at the interpretation clause and clauses 4, 5, and 6 to see how loosely the measure has been drawn. I cannot understand how it hap- pened that, in the debates on this Bill in the other Chamber, attention was not drawn to the drafting of, I might say, almost a third of the clauses. I propose referring firstly to those clauses which entitle women to act as police- men. I do not believe in policemen in petti- coats. I do not think the power the police- man has under this Bill should be given to women, nor should it be proposed in any other measure to give such power to them. We admire and reverence women because 8.30. they are women. When they put on the breeches we change our opinion. I feel that this particular clause will be viewed with a great deal of disfavour by women as well as by men ; and just fancy the idea of having women who had been created policemen by virtue of this Act parading the town up till four and five o'clock in the morning looking after children in the slums. Just let the Hon. the Minister in charge of this Bill fancy that. The Hon. the Minister need not interject ; he may annihilate me, and absolutely wither me up when he re- plies, if he is able. Just imagine women being appointed what are called in clause 5 " Pro- will be to take the steps provided by the sub- clauses of clause 5, where they find any young person of either sex "habitually loitering" in the streets or in out-of-the-way places at un- timely hours, meaning thereby between nine o'clock at night and five o'clock in the morn- ing. Now, it is all very well for ladies to be travelling the streets at afternoon-tea time, and up till nine o'clock ; but when they start rampaging about at nine o'clock at night and keep going till five in the morning for the purpose of running in loitering children I think the whole thing is a farce. Then, wo have no definition of what "habitually loiter- ing" is. Let us now consider the inter- pretation clause. In clause 2, "young person " means a boy or girl "apparently " not over the age of fourteen years. Now, what is "ap- parently not over the age of fourteen years." It takes a very clever judge of character or age to tell the age of a child between thirteen and fifteen, and I would like to know how any " Protection Officer " appointed under this Act is going to decide for herself or himself whether a young boy or girl seen about in the streets is to be run in as only " apparently not over the age of fourteen years." Again, the gravamen of the offence is, according to the Bill, "the habitually loitering in the streets or out-of-the- way places." Now, what is the meaning of that ? Is the "discreet woman " to have a circuit allowed her in out-of-the-way places ? As far as the cities are concerned, out-of-the-way places are just the kind of places into which I hope no woman would venture after dark. The reason why these Protection Officers are required in a city is because there is, unfortunately, an absence of parental control. The reason that children are seen in the City of Wellington at the early hours of the morning, as reported to the police officers, is because there is an abso- lute lack of home comfort and home control. If home is made pleasant to a child, or if parents exercise that influence over their children which they should exercise, there would be no wandering. But, so far as the City of Wellington is concerned, the history of the Courts show plainly that a Bill of this kind is required. In the present state of the galleries it is impossible to place on record the state of things that has been proved to exist. I need only refer to the hulk cases, and to other cases that have come before the Supreme Court with- in the last few years. I could convince any honourable gentleman who has qualms on the subject that there is a necessity for the Bill. There is the evidence on oath of the children themselves as to the state of things that exists. Sir, there are bands of children in this city who sally out at night ; they meet at different places by appointment, and then separate to meet again. There are children who travel round in the carly morning or late at night and behave in a disgraceful manner, and there is evidence to show that the Police Force as it is at present constituted is unable to cope with it. There has been no way in the past of punish- ing the parents of these children, though in 
<page:424>
nived at the wrongdoings. The fathers and mothers of the children -- there are cases of the kind on record -- have been proved in some instances to have shared the proceeds of the in- famous way in which these young children have lived. I do pot know what good could be doue by suggesting that women should enter on this crusade for the purpose of remedying this social evil ; but I do say that if some power is given to the Protection Officer, he being a male, as is set out in the statute, then good may be ex- pected to result. Subelause (1) of clause 5 pro- vides that the Protection Officer may "ques- tion the young person as to his name, abode, parents, or guardians, and his reason for being abroad, and may in his discretion report the occurrence to the parents or guardians of the child." Again, " If the answers are not satis- factory the Protection Officer shall accompany the young person to his home and hand him over to the person in charge thereof, and report the occurrence to such person." That act, it seems to me, must be taken as a warning to the parent or guardian. When the Protection Officer reports the young person to his parent he is to be considered guilty of a first offence. and if he offends again, then the law will deal out the penalty to him. I may say that, in my opinion, the penalty is too heavy. Section 9 says,- "In every case where the Magistrate finds such young person to be not under proper con- trol, each of his parents or guardians is severally liable to a penalty not exceeding ten pounds, or  to imprisonment for any period not exceeding three months." I admit that when the statute says " not ex- ceeding ten pounds " the fine may be limited to 1s., but I may tell the honourable gentle- man in charge of the Bill that the presiding Magistrates or Justices look to the amount of the penalty which is the maximum in order to decide what penalty to inflict. If you find a penalty of £100 in the statute, it is absolutely impossible to get any Magistrate to fine any- thing like a small sum. They say that the Legislature has considered the offence a severe one, and that it must be met by a severe penalty, and consequently a large fine follows the conviction. Then, subclause (3) of clause 5 says, " If the young person has been previously dealt with under the last preceding subsection the Protection Officer shall forthwith take such young person to a shelter." That seems to be a good idea. It is an innovation, but I think it is the right one. It would, at any rate, have the effect of pointing out to the parents and to the children that the law has an eye upon them, and that the State intends to prevent habitual loitering at unreasonable hours. Sir, I could give heart-breaking instances to members of the House. I could introduce into this House instances of young girls -- I know of some in my own mind - who have come into the town from the country ; they have got into the Chinese dens and the opium dens ; they have got about the streets, and have gone to ruin. I cannot par- ticularise on account of the state of the Mr. Wilford stand my position. At any rate, I say 1 could give instances to members to prove that some- thing should be done to help these children from falling, for children they are. Of course, nobody outside has any idea of what is going on. I hear people saying this kind of legislation is an absurdity. A sceptic will exclaim, " I have been in the city for so-many years : I have seen nothing of all this: I cannot believe such a canker -such a sore - exists." I always reply to gentlemen who talk in that way in these terms : " Your probable beat is from your house to your office and from your office to your house ; you do not go where you can see these things." How many people, for instance, going from Lambton Quay to Cuba Street at night-time, walk by way of the reclaimed land ? How many people go into the by-ways and streets known to be of low repute ? Very few; and that is where you see these sad sights; you do not expect to see them garlanded and festooned in the light of day. They live and flourish in darkness, where there is no brightness. I know the evil exists ; I know there is a necessity for some legislation to cope with this evil. Whether this Bill will have the effect of curing the evil I do not know; it is an experiment, and, like all experiments, has to be tried before we can guarantee a success. Turning again to the question of women Protection Officers, I do not believe the women of this colony desire that they should be placed in the position of being Protection Officers or Inspectors ; I do not think they themselves have asked for it ; and I think if any ladies or women - I think they prefer to be called women-have asked the Minister to introduce the clause to allow women to go round in this way, honourable members will be much astonished. I hope the Minister, when he replies, will tell us whether he has been urged as I suggest. I do not consider women should have that power. I am one of those who never had the opportunity of voting for the female franchise, but I know the benefits of it. My constituency never re- turned a Liberal member until women had the franchise, but when the ladies in my con- stituency had a vote everything was casy. I myself believe it has been a complete success. But I do not believe for a moment they desire this power should be given them, and in Com- mittee I intend to vote for the elimination of the clause. The very hours mentioned in the Bill are, to my mind, prohibitive of women acting in this position. Again, how is the female Protection Officer to be distinguished ? Would she wear a uniform ? Would she have a badge with a number? Would she have some kind of cap with a gold rim, or how would she be distinguished ? She would be in ordi- nary dress and attire. If, then, she is in ordinary dress and attire, look at the door it would open to fraud. We know at the present time there are young girls straving about the streets with no one to look after them, and they are very often entrapped by scheming women - bad, low women. What a weapon this Bill would be in their hands if all they 
<page:425>
streets till four or five in the morning and then say to some young girl, "I am a Protec- tion Officer ; what is your name ? Where do you live ? "et cetera. Then they could invoke all their powers of persuasion, and the young girl in many cases would easily fall a victim. Look at the abuses to which it might lead. Let me say one thing more before I conclude, and that is this : Clause 12 is a very good clause indeed. I cannot read it for reasons that are obvious to honourable members, but I con- gratulate the Minister on introducing it ; it is necessary. As to clause 13, it is simply a ma- chinery clause. Clause 14 I do not think need have been put in the Bill, because I believe the law as it at present stands is sufficiently com- prehensive to meet all requirements as far as its machinery is concerned. I congratulate the Minister in charge on introducing the mea- sure. I believe a great number of amendments will be moved in Committee in the way of amending the wording of clauses ; but I hope members will allow it to have a second reading, because I honestly and conscientiously believe it will do good. Mr. ELL (Christchurch City). - I have lis- tened with very great pleasure to the remarks made by the Minister in introducing this Bill, and also to the remarks of the honourable mem- ber for Wellington Suburbs. I am glad to see that the honourable member for Wellington Suburbs is taking a decided interest in social as well as in economic questions, and that he is prepared to take an active and intelligent inter- est in questions of social reform, and I hope that will be the case with more young Now- Zealanders who may come into this Chamber. Though on many questions of social reform he and I differ, and he thinks that I am wrong, with regard to this question I entirely agree with him as to the necessity for a Bill of this description. But I differ from him with regard to its being unseemly for women to take up this work, for this reason : that women have engaged in it in Christchurch. I do not know what has been the case in this town, but as far as Christ- church is concerned women have engaged in the work there, and with very good results indeed. Mr. GUINNESS .- Why interfere with them ? Mr. ELL .- Those connected with that work . have not the legal power, and that is what they feel very much indeed. Ladies have been engaged in this work, and have visited some undesirable resorts in Christchurch, and have assisted in taking young girls out of those places, and have assisted in setting them on a better road in life. They have carried on a most useful work, and without degrading them- selves in any way by doing such work. Some people say that such work is undignified for ladies, and that the police should do it. An Hon. MEMBER .- That is what they are for. Mr. ELL. - Just so ; but, although there exists now in our law a power which enables a policeman without warrant to take charge of any child that he finds in a house of ill-fame, my experience has been this: I have been working on a Council of a society carrying on this work in Christchurch for some years now, and taking an active part in it, and I find the police are reluctant to take up this very neces- sary work. I know of one case where it took the society I speak of three months before we could get the police to take two children out of a house which was acknowledged to be any- thing but a desirable home for two girls, both of them being of school age - that is, under thirteen years. I know of another case where it was reported to the police that a poor little child was living with its mother, a woman of dissolute habits and a confirmed drunkard. I reported the case along with another member of the committee, but the police did not take action, although we ourselves had searched and tried to discover the whereabouts of the child ; but after some delay the police took up the work. We had frequently to bring cases under the notice of the police, but they said they had enough of other work to look after in the detec- tion of other crimes, and they said they had no constable they could set apart for this particular work. We urged this-and I am sorry the De- partment of Justice did not agree with the society : that the department should appoint a mission constable to assist the society -there is a similar society in this city for the protection of women and children. But the department did not see its way to do that. I say it would be a material assistance to these societies, and I still think so. The evil does undoubtedly exist in the large cities, and there should be a con- stable who could be at liberty when the neces- sity arose to take up work of this description. I hope the Minister in charge of the depart- ment will take the matter into his earnest consideration, and see if it cannot be done. It may involve a little expenditure, but I do not think-in fact, I am certain that the public would not object to it. They would be rather glad that assistance was rendered in this way. That there is a necessity for the Bill I know, so far as my own town is concerned. Any one who passes through the streets of Christchurch at late hours at night will see girls of fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen hanging about in dark corners, and in the recesses of shop-windows and other parts, and they are gradually drifting into a life of crime. It is that age which is the most dangerous age; it is the age when some authority wants to be put into operation to check them on their down- ward path. It is all very well to say it is the duty of the parents. Granted, it is a re- sponsibility that rests with the parents; but when the parents do not realise their responsi- bility, then, as the Minister says very rightly, it is the duty of the community to step in and say that through the neglect of their parents these children shall not drift into a life of crime and wrong-doing for the rest of their days. Un- fortunately, we have too many parents who are careless of the whereabouts and of the goings and comings of their young people. I have seen them out at night at half-past ten 
<page:426>
member for Bay of Plenty says, " Good gracious." Well, Sir, I hope that, seeing our Judges are complaining of the growth of crime amongst our young people, and that the Magis- trates complain about the growth of crime among young people, and that the honourable member has taken up his residence in this country as a citizen, he is not going to treat lightly a question of this description, and laugh and ridicule what are absolute and plain facts. I do not mind ridicule, because I am a little thick in the skin so far as ridicule is concerned. Now, Sir, I hope the Minister will agree to fix the age at sixteen years, and not fourteen. An Hon. MEMBER. - Make it fifteen years. Mr. ELL .-- I will accept fifteen years as a compromise, but I would prefer sixteen. Then, Sir, in regard to clause 11, which gives power to the police to enter and search any house or other premises occupied or frequented by pros- titutes or gamblers, that applies only to boys ; but it should also apply to girls, and give the police authority to search in cases of girls drift- ing into places of ill-repote. There is just one matter I should like to refer to in regard to our young people. Perhaps it may be a little out- side this, but it is just as well to touch upon the various phases of this question. I now wish to refer to the duty of our local bodies in this re- spect. Only last week at half-past one o'clock I was on one of the vessels in port when twolittle lads came up to sell papers. I asked one what his age was, and he said seven years and a half. " What standard are you in? " I asked, and he  replied, "I do not know." " What class are you in ?" I asked : "I do not know," was the response. I asked the other boy what his age was, and he said ten years and a half. " What standard are you in ? " I asked. "The second," he said. " Have you been to school to-day ?" I asked, and he said " No." I simply wish to mention this fact as showing that there is some necessity for the local authorities - either edu- cational or city -- by establishing by-laws, as they have in many towns in the Home-country and as they now have in Christchurch, to exercise control over the street-trading child- ren. Members must have remarked them- selves that there are more small children-boys and girls -- selling papers on the streets here, and sometimes late at night, than in any other town in the colony. It does not reflect credit on the municipal authorities, and it is high time we had by-laws in operation here, as we have in Christchurch, to restrict trading by children. Unless they are decently clad and have had a decent schooling they ought not to be allowed to trade, and then only up to a reasonable hour at night, which can be definitely fixed. That will go a long way towards preventing many lads starting on a downward course. It is not the most desirable thing that young boys and girls should be running in and out of hotels, billiard-rooms, and theatres selling literature, some of which I do not consider very high class. I shall cordially support the second reading of the Bill, and I trust that in Com- mittee the amendments will be made that I Mr Ell power to go into undesirable resorts and take out girls as well as boys whom they may find there, and also that the age may be raised to sixteen years from fourteen. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) .- I think it about time we woke the House up, or we will soon all be dead. It is clear the Government is not ready with the business of the session, otherwise the honourable gentleman who intro- duced this Bill would not ask men of robust mind to waste their time discussing such flap- doodle as this. The last two evenings have been wasted discussing measures of no consequence whatever to the State. As I say, the clear reason is that the (Government is merely killing time because of its unpreparedness. Again, I ask, why is this Bill introduced ? And that question brings me at once to the remarks of the honourable member for Wellington Suburbs, who says he deems this Bill to be a necessity. In consequence of what ? In consequence, as he says, of the immoral con- dition of the juvenile population of Wellington. Now, Sir. the honourable gentleman displayed a surprising knowledge of the haunts and vices of the immoral and degraded classes of this city. I was surprised at the completeness of that knowledge. I would not care to have passed through such associations myself. But, Sir, I utterly deny the existence of such a condition of things as the honourable gentleman described, and I will give to the House the opinion of men whose duty it is to inquire into matters of this kind, and to probe them to the very bottom. In dealing with this branch of the subject, I leave out of consideration the persons belonging to the " social purity society " -- the poke-your- nosc-into - other - people's - business society, or whatever you may choose to call it-for I deny the right of these people to invoke the aid of the State to carry out their whims and fads. Why do not these prudes content themselves by giving public expression to their views and intentions as members of a private association ? Why should they be privileged to invoke the aid of the Legislature to give effect to what they deem to be the proper method of managing the morals of the community ? I am quite aware that the Ministers' Association of Wellington and the ladies of the social purity society point to me as an ogre, a monster, a something to be shunned and avoided by the juvenile population of the city ; but all the others of the people of Wellington know that, like the late Professor Blackie, I have an inborn hatred of cant and humbug : and I go so far as to say that among the great bulk of the population of this city my opinions on the subject of the morals of the people carry as much weight as if they were expressed from the pulpit, or from the platform of the social purity society. Now, in 1897 a similar agitation was started in Wellington to What that which has been set afoot now. happened then ? The agitation was the result of six cases of indecent assault which were brought before the Supreme Court. These six cases were deemed by the social purity society sufficient to justify panic legislation. Represen-

liament. A Select Committee was set up, and a Young Persons Protection Bill was introduced. Absurd! Worse than absurd that the Parliament of this country should be asked to seriously discuss such a subject upon such grounds. Now, these were the cases which gave rise to the agi- tation in this city in 1897 :- Charles Cripps and Defiling children. Minnie Brown Verdict : Guilty of in- decent assault. Sentence: Twelve ca- lendar months. William Frederick Defiling a child. Morris Verdict : Guilty. Sentence: Two years' imprisonment. Alfred Percy West- Indecent assault. Verdict : Not guilty. bury (two indict- ments) .. Indecent assault. Nicholas Frey Verdict : Not guilty. George Catchpole .. Indecent assault. Verdict : Not guilty. Henry Hodgson Indecent assault. Nolle prosequi entered. There were two convictions and four ac- quittals. Now, here we have another agitation. And what is it based upon ? It is said that there is another eruption of indecent assault cases. I will quote a few of the cases to show that there is no necessity whatever for this panic legislation. At the Supreme Court, Wellington, in February last, a man named William Budd, of Masterton, was charged with having committed an offence upon his two daughters, twins, between the age of thirteen and fourteen. It was indubitably   proved that these little fiends-you cannot call them anything else -- had conspired to make this charge against their father to get him out of the way-the mother being dead -in order that they might turn his house into a house of ill- fame. Such things seem positively incredible, I know; but that was the evidence given in Court, and upon that evidence the jury acquitted the accused. Here is a terrible state of things. These are the cases brought into the Courts of the country, and upon such cases, I am sorry to say, the member for Wellington Suburbs speaks in support of such a Bill as this. Mr. WILFORD .- I never mentioned those cases. Mr. FISHER .- No ; but I take care that they shall be mentioned, to expose the absurdity of this class of legislation. Here is an Invercargill case, tried on the 5th March : - "In a charge against H. C. Colyer of criminal assault on a girl, the complainant and her cousin, a boy of fifteen, admitted immorality before Colver entered the house, and the boy stated that the girl suggested putting the blame on Colyer. The Crown Prosecutor threw up the case, a course in which Mr. Justice Williams concurred, and the jury, without retiring, re- turned a verdict of Not guilty." "In Napier, on the 11th February, Charles Williams was charged with an indecent assault on two little girls, and was found Not guilty." land was placed on trial for the second time in the Supreme Court to-day on a charge of assaulting a child. The jury, after two hours' retirement, intimated that they were unable to agree ; but, by direction of the Judge, they retired again, and returned some time later with a verdict of Not guilty." Do not these cases show the danger of private associations making charges resulting in public prosecutions in the higher Courts of the colony, to the disgrace and the discredit of the people of New Zealand ? These cases should be left wholly to the police, who understand their duty. Of course. there is nothing personal in my refer- ence to the honourable member for Wellington Suburbs. I hope that is understood, for he and I have always worked together so well. But he has made a statement affecting the moral status of the people of Wellington, and against that statement I quote the opinions of two persons of high authority in their respective spheres in this city. This evidence was given before the Young Persons Protection Bill Committee, on Tuesday, the 26th October, 1897. That was a Select Committee of this House, of which Sir Robert Stout was Chairman. Mr. Pender, Inspector of Police, stationed in Wellington, was examined. He said,- " I see it is proposed in the Bill before Par- liament to authorise the lady Protection Officer to bring girls to a refuge. I think the better course would be to serve notice on them and their parents to all attend before a Magistrate in his private room, and then he should have power to make such order as was proper. The order might be made for maintenance against the parents. I do not believe in bringing girls to refuges or police-stations, et cetera. I would only serve the notice if the parents failed to do their duty after warning. I would do the same with boys if they were caught gambling, et cetera." "I am very strongly in favour of the Con- tagious Diseases Act. I believe it did a lot of good in keeping the girls off the street. It frightened them. Everything, of course, de- pended on the wise administration of the Act. Under my management of the Act in Christ- church, no one of the Police Force, save one sergeant, had anything to do in administering the Act, except to make a report. Women were not arrested. This sergeant who was em- ployed, if he became aware of any one being a prostitute, reported to me. I then went to the Magistrate and laid an information ; he issued an order, on a printed form, directing the person to appear at Addington for examina- tion. If she failed to appear the doctor re- ported accordingly, then the Magistrate issued a summons to her to appear in his private room to show cause ; if she failed to show cause he made an order. The policemen as a whole did not know what was being done. It could not occur that any respectable woman was arrested ; it never occurred. Several of the women of the town wished the Act to be in force." That is the opinion of the police officer. It will be said, of course, that the opinion of Mr. George Fisher is not worth serious considera- 
<page:428>
opinion of Mr. Inspector Pender is not of much greater value, because he is a police officer. Then, I will give the opinion of the Rev. Mr. Paterson, Presbyterian minister of this city, and I ask whether his opinion is worth con- sidering ? What does he say? Examined on the same day, he says, -- " I have been a minister of the Presbyterian Church in Wellington for nearly thirty years. I do not think we can judge of juvenile de- pravity by merely the reports in the newspapers. I regret the publication of these cases in the papers. These reports have a most injurious effect on the minds of the youth. I do not think that juvenile depravity has increased more than the increase of the population. The immorality of Wellington is not to be compared with that of the large cities in Britain. 1 bave had experience in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Liverpool. Two or three years ago there was a charge of immorality against our public schools. The Education Board made strict inquiry, and found that the charge was groundless. I think gambling is far more prevalent amongst the boys than immorality. I think the Bill will serve a good purpose in checking the young people going on the public streets in the even- ing. I do not think the Bill will cure the evil. I think one of the evils of colonial life is a love of pleasure and of attending entertainments at late hours. There is not the same home-life as at Home. Where you get drunken parents you may get immorality, but there are exceptions to that. There is a little less parental control here than at Home. I would stop the Courts allowing these depravity cases to be made public. I think the putting-down of brothels has been beneficial." Now, there is the opinion of one of the oldest and most respected ministers of the Gospel in Wellington. Is that opinion to be believed ? Will any member in this House, will any person in this community, deny the truth, the perfect accuracy, of what the Rev. Mr. Paterson says. I accept his statement fully and implicitly, and I add to that statement much experience of my own. Now, the honourable member for Wellington Suburbs said that most men were concerned only with what came under their observation during their walk from their home to their office, and that they saw none of these immoral scenes. Now, it so happens that when Parliament is not sitting I cross the reclaimed land nearly every hour of the day and nearly every hour of the night, and I have not on any one occasion witnessed any of those things which the honourable gentleman says he has so often witnessed. An Hon. MEMBER .- You are fortunate. Mr. FISHER .- I do not contest that point with my honourable friend, but I am con- cerned about the moral reputation of the people of the City of Wellington; and I say to the scoffers-some who sit on my right and some who sit on my left- I say to them, and I say it proudly, and with a feeling of dignity, that the morals of this city are as much in my keeping as they are in the keeping of Mr. Commissioner Tuubridge or the social purity Mr. Fisher is my answer. Why am I, without interrup- tion, returned to this House, election after election ? That effectively answers every sneer. What use is it, then, for the Ministers' Associa- tion of Wellington, or anybody else, to point the finger of scorn at me? Some time ago I attended some anti-gambling meetings at St. John's Presbyterian Schoolroom, Wellington. Some parents there were who remarked to their offspring, with an awesome, gruesome feeling, " That Think of the s George Fisher."" pity of it! Why should young children have such small-souled bigotry instilled into their minds? Think of the prejudice of parents being carried from one generation to another. I pray that some day their minds may be enlightened and enlarged. Here is another and a novel phase of the morality question : Among the evidence taken by the Young Persons Protection Bill Committee was a statement given by some ladies who occupy very high social positions in this city, and they are ladies in regard to whom it would be possible only to speak with feelings of the very highest respect, and yet they speak of subjects here which I would domand that no daughter of mine should either speak or read about. I am the father of a family, and I have daughters whose purity and chastity I would not volunteer to exchange for the purity and chastity of the ladies who sign this document. An Hon. MEMBER. - Whom are you refer- ring to? Mr. FISHER .- I will not answer that. An Hon. MEMBER .- When was it ? Mr. FISHER .- I will not answer that. But, because of their social position, these ladies carry with them a great influence, and I regret that in this matter they exert such an influence, because these are subjects so repulsive-re- pulsive to me, a man of the world-that I wonder that any female, of whatever station, should touch them at all. But I suppose, for people who like this sort of thing, this is just the sort of thing those people like. What would be said, I wonder, of the lower classes of society if they unthinkingly touched such a subject-if they attached their names to statements such as these? These very people would say, "What can you expect from low, ignorant people such as they?" And have these people heard nothing of immorality among the higher classes in Wellington ? Strange, if they have not ! Sir, it is better that this whole subject should be attacked boldly by men of robust mind. Let the sub- ject be dealt with openly by men who under- stand what the virtues and the weaknesses of human nature are. I do not claim to possess more or greater knowledge upon this sub- ject than any other man, but I do know the regretful consequences of flaunting the subject before the public as we have done to- day, and as we did in 1897. What good comes of it ? Let the temperance people, let the people who wish to advocate moral purity and the elevation of the people to the higher grades of intelligence, give effect to their views in any way they please ; but I protest against them 
<page:429>
of moral degradation. I detest this odious en- bodiment of pharisaism and cant. If any of us were in Melbourne, Sydney, London, Paris, Ber- lin, or Vienna, say, and heard any man give to the people of New Zealand such a character as was given to them here this evening, what would we say ? Iask any of those members who have spoken to-night what they would say to such a charge if made by a person belonging to any other country, I am sure they would deny it vigorously. Then, why themselves express such opinions on the floor of this House ? There is the testimony of a high police-officer, Inspec- tor Pender. Thereis the testimony of a minister of the Gospel, the Rev. James Paterson. who oc- cupies a high position in this city. That tes- timony is opposed to the statements made by gentlemen in this House this evening. Sir, we live in a hysterical period. It is one of those spasmodic ebullitions which come in cycles every four or five years. We are now at the eyelic period. As the Young Persons Protection Bill of 1897 was rejected by this Legislature, so I hope this Bill will meet a similar fate. have no care beyond that of any other man in regard to the moral elevation of the people of this country, but I claim to have a care equal to that of any other man. Why should it devolve upon me to speak so strongly and in this strain ? It is because I dislike the ways of the mischievous meddlers who will insist on poking their noses into other people's business, and who defame and traduce the people of this country. Those gentlemen who have spoken here this evening, and those who denounce the morals of the people of this country when speaking at public meetings, do more injury   than really results from the actual existence of the evil of which they complain. Why cannot they learn to mind their own business? Why not leave the police and the municipal authori- ties to do their duty without interference ? Those bodies have already ample powers under the legislation of the colony. What do we want with "discreet " women and petticoated termagants who seem anxious to jostle with the midnight rabble? Sir, I do not re- gard them as ranking with the more respectable people of the colony. It is a man's duty which they wish to take upon themselves, and I do object to making a mockery of the thing and to have this country pointed at with the finger of ridicule by the people of all other nations. But what can be said after they read the speeches made to-night, beginning with the mild effort of the Minister for Public Works. What is to be thought of the people of New Zealand by the people of other countries and by the members of other Legislatures? Are they not entitled to assume that these statements, having been publicly made on the floor of this House, are true, and that the gentlemen who made them understand what they are speaking about? It. will justly be concluded that they have studied the subject, and that, having given it their calm consideration, that is their deliberate opinion of the character of the people of New those statements a deliberate contradiction in the presence of the gentlemen who made them. I say it is not a just description of the people of New Zealand. I say it is a libel upon the national character; and I conclude by express- ing the hope that this Bill will not pass. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton) .- - Mr. Speaker, this is a very painful subject, but, as the member for Wellington City said just now, it is one that requires to be faced boldly and robustly. The honourable gentleman is always dramatic in his speeches, and, while one listens to him with pleasure and admires his eloquence and clocution, it is always desirable to pierce beneath the dramatic style of his speeches, and ascertain what the logical position is and what the actual facts are. Sir, like him, I am the father of a family, and I regard the growing tendency to juvenile immorality in this country as one of the most frightful developments of our modern life. No man who goes about the streets of our cities, whether it be Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, or Dunedin-no man whose eyes are open to the facts that are sure I to come under his notice-can deny that there is an awful amount of widespread juvenile depravity, which this Bill proposes to make an attempt to reach and cure. It may, as the honourable gentleman who has just sat down says, be patriotic not to mention these things, or to speak of them with bated breath ; but we have a duty to perform not only to the present population, but to future generations of this colony. I believe I should be correct if I say that, so far as the Stipendiary Magistrates' Courts of this colony are concerned, 75 per cent. of the business, outside of purely criminal and debt-collecting business, relates to affiliation cases. I make that statement with some sense of responsibility, and after making inquiries in one of the larger Courts. An Hon. MEMBER. - NO. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- Well, I am speaking within the mark, and if those honourable gentle- men who doubt my statement will do as I have had to do-visit on business the Courts of some of our large cities, and see the class of people that are coming there paying and receiving money - they will know I am correct in what I say. People have no idea of the enormous amount of this immorality that filters through the Courts of the colony. You go and ask any of the Magistrates in the large cities what pro- portion of their business arises out of this class of cases, and they will tell you an enormous amount of it does; and what comes before the Courts is, unfortunately, only a small part of what occurs. An Hon. MEMBER .- This Bill will not cure that. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL. - The honourable gentleman says this Bill will not cure it ; but what this Bill is intended to do is to reach those at an earlier stage of their life who may, unfortunately, later on join the worst classes of the community : and so far as this Bill goes in the direction of compelling young people to go to their homes in the early hours of the 
<page:430>
the natural thing is to say that our efforts in this direction ought to be confined to moral suasion, and we fully recognise the efforts that are made by women's societies, by the Salvation Army, and by other organizations that try to remove the children from our streets. But we all know they have not succeeded. It is a pain- ful statement to make, but we all know they have not succeeded. The member for Welling- ton Suburbs has drawn a picture, and painted it in very dark colours indeed, of what goes on, and I do not think he has overstated it. The reply of the member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) is this: that certain cases have come before the Criminal Courts and that these cases were not successful so far as proving the guilt of the persons charged. That, Sir, is not the gravamen of the remarks made by the member for Wellington Suburbs. The member for Wellington Suburbs was deal- ing with the general question of immoral con- duct as distinguished from criminal conduct : and I believe that that is the correct position to take up. Now, I regretted very much to hear the remarks made by the honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) in regard to the influence of certain ladies in this city. I believe that those ladies are actuated by the highest humanitarian and philanthropie motives, and that they endeavour to raise public opinion on this subject. Let us take the quota- tions which he read from the evidence of In- spector Pender, and from the evidence of the Rev. James Paterson. In his evidence, Mr. Paterson made one remark - I do not know whether the honourable member intended to read it, though I will do him the credit of saying he read it deliberately -to the effect that the tendency of the Bill would be to require these young people to go home early in the evening. I under- stand that that remark from the witness the member for Wellington City put into the box, when he was delivering his speech just now, was a clear proof in the Rev. Mr. Paterson's mind that there is a necessity for some such Bill as this measure which is now before the House. And yet, while saying this regarding the Bill, I cannot help thinking it goes too far. My impression is that it would be better if we were to start legislation on this subject by having in cities-cities that should be proclaimed by the Governor by Order in Council-the ringing of the curfew bell at nine o'clock at night. An Hon. MEMBER. - For everybody ? Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- No; I do not say for everybody. Will the honourable gentleman allow me to finish ? If at a certain hour every night a signal were given, by a bell or in some other way, that all young persons under the age of fifteen or sixteen years had to repair to their homes, and the responsibility were then laid on the police- for I would have no one but the man in uniform to administer the Act, or some other person in uniform-to warn any young person of the apparent age of under fifteen or sixteen years that they must at once proceed to their homes, it might be found that Mr. G. W. Russell be given a trial for a year, and if it did not succeed, or help to lessen the social cancer that undoubtedly exists, then let the House take the further step that is proposed in this Bill. Mr. FISHER .- Ring a bell for the fathers and mothers too. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .-- I have known some fathers who would not go home if you rang twenty bells. A great deal depends upon the fathers and mothers. I am speaking now with regard to young people, and I say no one, un- fortunately, who goes about our streets - especially in some of the more secluded por- tions-can fail to see on every hand evidence that some such proposal as underlies this Bill is absolutely necessary. I shall support the second reading of the Bill, because I believe it makes an attempt to reach what is undoubtedly, as I have said, a running sore upon the beds politic. In passing it I believe the House will be not publishing the shame of the colony, but taking some practical step towards preventing what will be a disastrous and sorrowful state of things in future years. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) .- I listened with a great deal of interest to the speech delivered by the honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher), and I cannot say I felt at all con- vinced by his arguments. I was rather asto- nished that he made the speech he did, holding in his hand, as I knew he did, the report of the Young Persons Protection Bill Committee in 1897. I followed him when he was reading from that report, and I carefully noted that he picked out the passages which suited his own argument, and left out those which dealt with the position from another point of view. Mr. FISHER .- One usually does so. Mr. J. ALLEN .- I generally read both sides. Nevertheless, in quoting the evidence of the Rev. Mr. Paterson, by mistake he went on too far, and got into a sentence he did not mean to read : " I think the Bill will serve a good pur- pose in checking the young people going on the public street in the evening." Of course this is the pith of his evidence, no matter what he said in regard to other things. In Inspector Pender's evidence the member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) picked out the evidence which dealt with the question practically from his point of view, but did not give the material evidence given by Mr. Pender. I am aware that the honourable gentleman was doing what he naturally would do-attempting to protect his own city from any aspersions that might have been cast, in the course of the debate or pre- viously, on the morality of his own particular place ; and it is quite right that he should. And I do not want to say that Wellington. or any other city, is more immoral than any other large city in any other country : but to ignore altogether the evidence we have had not only exposed in the Courts but also given before that Committee would be wrong. nor should we be doing our duty as legislator- if we did not attempt to at any rate view the question as placed before us publicly, but more The particularly by the evidence in 1897. 
<page:431>
ground than the Bill covers. What the honour- able member was referring more particularly to in the course of his speech was not those portions which deal with juvenile depravity so much as that portion which deals with that of an older age, and I was sorry he should have cast any aspersion, directly or indirectly, on any ladies in Wellington, and should have refused to give their names. Mr. FISHER .- You can give them. Mr. J. ALLEN .- Shall I give them ? I will give the names, but I will not say what their evidence was about. I will give the names so that the House may know whether the names are worthy of respect or not. Mr. FISHER .- You should read what they signed. I ask you to read the repulsive circular they signed. Mr. J. ALLEN .- I will show it to any mem- ber of the House who wants to see it, but I will not read what they did sign on this particular occasion. The names are Annie Habens, Ellen S. Greenwood, Stella M. Izard, M. Ashcroft, S. T. Stock, T. V. Morrah, M. Clere, M. Hall, and F. E FitzGerald -- members of the committee. I think the names are sufficient to justify any member of the House in believing that they would not have been placed on any document that was not worthy of our respect. Now, with regard to the evidence of Mr. In- spector Pender, the honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) quoted a por- tion of Mr. Inspector Pender's evidence which partly bore upon the question. Certainly it did  not bear upon the question dealt with in the Bill at all, but dealt with another question alto- gether. So far as the Bill is concerned, what did Mr. Inspector Pender say ? He says he has discovered during this year eleven girls of ages varying from twelve to sixteen years who were prostitutes in Wellington. I will not go on to read further what he says in respect to that, but he also says, "In my opinion a good deal of the trouble is caused by bad homes, the children being huddled together, and bad pre- mises-no place to play." Now, with respect to there being no place to play, the honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher), who has just left the Chamber, if he really were desirious of improving the moral condition of Wellington, would take note of these words of Mr. Inspector Pender, that the Wellington people have no place to play in, and he would not be so strong an opponent of every effort that has been made by the authorities of the City of Wellington to provide more places for the people to play in. I hope he will take note of these words, and, when provision is at- tempted to be made by the authorities of Wel- lington to provide places for play, that, instead of being an opponent of those measures, he will be found supporting them. Then, Inspector Pender says, " I have been an Inspector four years and eight months in Wellington. I think the evil is greater now than when I came here." One could go through the whole of this evi- dence, and find many and many an instance of similar facts being placed before us to those I and I do not want to particularise any more than I have done, especially as the member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) has left the Cham- ber. Some remarks have been made-I think by the honourable member for Wellington Suburbs-as to the position that women might take up under this Bill. I am not very much in favour of policemen in petticoats, and if there were any way of getting rid of the difficulty without employing policemen in petticoats I should be only too glad to see it done. But I cannot help acknowledging this fact : that women have been working in this city here and elsewhere with success. I think the Salva- tion Army have been doing this work, or the Salvation Army women have been doing it, and I know that the Salvation Army authorities- and the evidence is here also in this report- say that the women are best able to cope with this difficulty ; and if one has the evidence of those who have had experience such as Salva- tion Army officers have had, and they say that women are more capable of acting as Protection Officers, as well as in rescue homes, I think provision should be made in the Bill to employ women for such work. Although there are difficultics in respect to women doing the work -- and I can understand it would be a very serious thing for a woman in the street to have to take a boy of fourteen under her charge, and take him to his home or to a rescue home -- still. I believe there are occasions where women can do better work even than men can, and, if that is so, I cannot see why provision cannot be made in the Bill so that women may be ap- pointed as well as men where necessity is shown for it. Sir, the honourable member for Wel- lington City (Mr. Fisher) was quoting cases which were brought before the Court, and, I suppose, in taking his quotation from Hansard he had forgotten to look up the report itself, and therefore fell into an error. The cases that were brought hefore the Court in Wellington were not six, but nine. Mr. WILFORD .- Nine cases, but about eighteen charges. Mr. J. ALLEN .- I do not know how many charges there were, but nine cases were re- corded in the evidence given there. There are nine different individuals here recorded. Mr. WILFORD .- There were eight or nine witnesses -young girls - in nearly every case. Mr. J. ALLEN .- Very likely, and that makes it still worse : but, at any rate, the honourable member for Wellington City-I do not know whether intentionally ; probably not - was making the cases even lighter than they were. Then, coming to the question of the rescue of young persons, the Minister is proposing to remedy this evil in the Bill now before us. Sir, I shall support the second reading of the Bill ; not that I believe the Bill is going to do any very great good, but it may do good. I hope it will : but I am quite certain of this: that the evil exists. It may not be growing. I will not say it is. I will say this : that our evidence of the evil is growing, probably because the public conscience has been awakened to the 
<page:432>
keen to search out for itself the evil where it esiste. Probably, also, the records are better kept. At any rate, we know more about these cases than we need to, even if they are not increasing. But, whether they are increasing or whether they are not, there is sufficient for us, at any rate, to attempt to tackle the ques- tion ; and the Bill proposes to do so. Sir, I believe that the Bill may do some good, and therefore I shall support the second reading. I am not altogether in love with it. I am not altogether in love with the Protection Officer ; but something must be done, and if we do not have a Protection Officer, what are we to do ? Some honourable member has suggested it should be left to the police, and that only those who have a uniform on-meaning by that a police officer-should be authorised to deal with those who are unprotected persous under this Bill. Well, I think that the evidence disclosed in this report points to the fact that a police officer is not the best person to deal with such cases. He will not do it, nor can he do it as well, I believe, as a special person having special capabilities, either man or woman, appointed for the particular pur- pose, and therefore I think that the de- sire of the Bill to appoint a Protection Officer, either man or woman, would be an improvement on the appointment of a police officer in uniform. Sir, I feel that clause 9 is a very serious clause, and one that we shall have to consider with a great deal of care when in Committee. I know that a proviso is contained in clause 9 protecting the parents to a certain extent ; but it does seem a very severe penalty that a parent may be called before a Magistrate, and fined $10 and receive three months' imprisonment. Now, that im- prisonment is not apart from the fine, but is included in the penalty. Mr. HALL-JONES. -. It is an alternative. Mr. J. ALLEN .- No : "such imprisonment being in addition to such penalty." They may be imprisoned as well as having the penalty imposed. Of course, it is right that severe measures should be taken to make parents take care of their children when they are not doing so. And, after all, I believe the greatest sinners in this matter are the parents, and not the children, and the State, if it is to do anything, ought to do something to put the blame on the right shoulders. If parents are neglecting their children, as is apparent, then, if the State is to step in at all it must step in and say, " You parents must do something more than you have done in the past to see how your children are going on." Although the penalty is severe, and may be too severe, that is a Committee objection, and the penalty may be modified when we get into Committee. I do not agree with the honourable member for Wel- lington City that it shows any want of robust- ness of mind to attempt to deal with a serious question of this kind, which is one that has troubled all of the more respectable in the com. munity. It is not robust to sit down and say, " Oh, let things rip "; and I believe the more Mr. J. Allen matter, and is not afraid to come out into the open and publicly speak about it. 1 am quite convinced it is a bad thing to be spoken about, and that it does harm, but it is a much greater harm to let the evil exist and be silent about it, and, even by doing a temporary evil now, by making such things as this public we can eventually do a much greater good. How- ever. I do not know that it is an easy matter to reform the morals of the community by Act of Parliament, and I never believed we could : but there are Acts of Parliament that have been passed that have done great good, perhaps not for the morals, but for the com- munity apart from its morals, and I believe that by an attempt made by the Legislature to do something we shall be quickening the pulse of the public conscience, and helping that part of the public mind that is alive, and stimulating it to greater efforts. I do not know that Acts of Parliament will ever make us moral ; but, if Acts of Parliament induce particular individuals to think more about these things, and to induce people to try to keep their children in the more moral and straight course of life, I think Acts of Parlia- ment ought to be passed. I. at any rate, will do my best to assist the Minister to pass this Bill, and make it a workable measure when we get into Committee. Mr. WITHEFORD (Auckland City) .- I cer- tainly think that no greater or nobler work can be engaged in than improving the social and moral condition of the people, and by com- mencing with the children we take a step in the right direction. The honourable member for Riccarton, in the course of his excellent re- marks, referred to Auckland, and I feel called upon to say a word or two in respect to that city. As far as I am aware, Auckland does not need this Bill so much as Christchurch or Wellington, judging by the speeches made by the members representing those cities. I re- spect the motives which actuate the intro- ducer of this Bill and those who support it. I believe that they are conscientious in believing that this Bill goes in the right direction- namely, that of improving the condition of our young people. But I would not like it to go forth that the children of this colony are any worse than children in any other part of the world. I have travelled through many countries. -- I have travelled, probably, as much as the ave- rage member of this House, and I am of opinion that the morality and behaviour of the chil- dren in this country are as good as those of the children in any other country in the world. And in saying that I may say that I have studied this subject. I think there exists a higher moral standard on the part of the young people in this colony-especially in the country districts - than exists in almost any other country. The comparatively small amount of evil that exists in the towns in New Zealand is certainly made the most of. I shall support the second reading of this Bill. At the same time, like many other measures of this nature-for instance, like the measure to stop 
<page:433>
the drinking customs and to close the hotels- there is too much of a negative character, and too little of the practical element, in regard to this attempt at moral reform. If something is done in this direction in the future I think it will be in providing counter-attractions, such as institutions where athletic exercises are en- couraged, pastimes, and recreations ; and thus we may draw the young people away from their only promenades, or resorts which are now for a certain class restricted to the streets and hotels. I trust that this Bill may be so amended in Committee that if it passes it will have a good effect, and therefore I shall support the second reading. Mr. HANAN (Invercargill) .- I intend to sup- port this Bill, believing as I do in the broad principle that the State has a perfect right to undertake the care of its children. I think it was Victor Hugo who said "that all the vagabondage in the world begins in neglected children." That, Sir, is, I think, in a great measure true. We know that there is fre- quently found incapacity on the part of parents to care for the mental and moral training of their children. The Government and the people should tender them the best helps. It has been said by the member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) that we are casting a stigma on the young people of this colony by passing such a Bill as this. I think that the Government of this colony is doing its duty in looking after neglected children. They know very well that there are parents who have become so de-  graded from one cause or another that they do not look after their children, who are, as a consequence, thrown upon the State, and become a menace to society. Every society necessarily reserves to itself the right to control the lives of those who endanger the common weal. It is the duty of the State to do all that is possible to insure our young people being trained to become good and useful citizens, upon the presence of which depends the future welfare of the country. It cannot be denied that frequently the evils which we have heard so much about this evening spring from the want of supervision in the home, from the absence of an exercise of parental control, and from the state of domestic religion. We have heard, Sir, from some members in this debate the old "gag " that you cannot make people sober or moral by Act of Parliament. They may as truly say that man cannot be made honest by such means. Both sayings have an equal modicum of truth. But Acts of Parlia- ment, I contend, do lessen the number of men who steal, and can be made to lessen the number of young men who get drunk. do not believe that juvenile crime in this colony is so bad as has been stated by some speakers this evening. But, even supposing things are not so bad, and the condition of affairs now existing may not render the Bill at the present time actually necessary, there is no harm in putting on the statute-book of this colony a measure such as this, which may be brought into operation when our cities . have become more densely populated, and VOL. CXVII .- 27. when the condition of affairs may render the enforcement of its provisions absolutely neces- sary. This Bill goes in the direction of pre- venting juvenile vice, and minimising evil influences to which young children may be sub- ject. To secure a salutary control over children of tender years, and whose parents are not alive to their parental responsibilities-to remove children from evil associations and bad environ- ments-in other words, to improve socially and morally children whose proper bringing up was or is neglected, are objects of the highest com- mendation. Wherever juvenile depravity or vice exists to any extent, it must have the effect of sapping the very foundations of national life. Now, Sir, I should like to have seen some pro- vision in the direction of suppressing juvenile smoking. I think there is sufficient power under the Municipal Corporations Act of last year to enable the Councils to pass by-laws dealing with this question, but so far no such highly desirable by-laws have been passed. An. Hon. MEMBER .- There is a Bill now before the House. Mr. HANAN .- Well, I think sufficient power is given under the Municipal Corporations Act, and it is a matter of regret that Councils do not take advantage of the power conferred. Now, Sir, if we look at the records of the Courts throughout the colony we cannot be blind to the fact that juvenile vice is increasing. One can hardly take up a newspaper and read the Police Court or Supreme Court pro- ceedings without coming across cases relating to juvenile crime. These Press reports of criminal cases are very often read by young children, and a great deal of barm is con- sequently done to such young readers. Dis- cretion should be exercised in the reporting of cases. No indelicate and disgusting details of cases should be allowed to be published. The honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) referred to a number of cases brought by young girls against men. But, Sir, those statements were really against his con- tention that there is no juvenile depravity in Wellington. His remarks also go to show that there are numbers of neglected children in the colony, and that they are loitering about the streets associating with bad companions, and having their minds seriously contaminated, and being in other ways degraded. If such young persons' sense of refinement, of self- respect, and dignified behaviour has been dulled in their childhood, what kind of men or women will they grow up? I have, myself, been called upon to defend men from charges brought by young girls, and in nearly all the cases the men were not convicted. The jury I disbelieved the girls' evidence, because when they were examined, and the case exhaustively gone into, it was found the children, owing to their lying propensities and bad character, were not to be believed. I do not believe in boys or girls being allowed to wander about the streets at all hours of the night without restriction. As to the proposal to appoint women Inspectors for the supervision or control of these children, I think it is a step in the right direction. And 
<page:434>
who are prepared to undertake this duty of rescue work are deserving of the heartiest praise and every credit. It shows that they care for the welfare of neglected children, knowing that it is in the interests of such children, and in the interests of the colony as a whole, that the moral children should not be neglected, but should be cared for, so that any downward tendency on their part should be arrested, con- sequently thereby promoting individual and national moral progress. No v, we have heard something about the bringing-up of children in this colony and their behaviour, and I have no hesitation in contending that our boys and girls are as well behaved and as moral as any children in any part of the world. Well, so far as the general reputation of the colony is con- cerned for the morality and good behaviour of its children, I need only to allude to the general conspicuous good conduct shown by our boys who went to South Africa. Is it not a fact that the young men who went from New Zealand to fight for the Empire in the Trans- vaal established for themselves a character that was excelled by no others from any part of the world, either as regards morality, honour, man- liness, or so far as courage and heroism were cencerned ? Mr. LAWRY .- By this Bill you want to say they are blackguards. Mr. HANAN. - This Bill does not affect them. or in any way reflect on their character. I say the creditable testimony I have mentioned in regard to our boys who went to South Africa is  one we have every reason to be proud of. Now, this Bill is simply a preventive measure to check the growth of juvenile impurity and to suppress juvenile depravity where it existed. This should be the aim of all right-thinking citizens. Its object is to insure that neglected children shall not, as it were, be allowed to fall into crime, but that they shall have care and attention, so that they may grow up a credit to themselves and to the land of their birth. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) .-- 10.30. Sir, I should like to add my protest to that of the honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) against the Government introducing Bills of the class of the one at present under discussion, apparently with the intention of wasting the time of the House. Sir, one has only got to look round this Cham- ber to see the small interest that is taken in this Bill. For the whole of this week we have simply been doing what soldiers call "marking time." Sir, I should like to know from the Minister in charge of this Bill how long this is to go on. When are we going to have Bills brought down that will be of some good to the country, and stop all this namby - pamby kind of stuff that we have been getting for the last week or so in this House? If the whole of the Bills we have been endeavouring to pass this session were thrown out, the country would be no sufferer. This Bill has no doubt been introduced with the most laudable inten- tions, but the country would not suffer if it was never passed. It has been before us ever Mr. Hanan think the country is a bit the worse for its not being on the statute-book. The Bill is probably introduced with the intention of doing away with an evil which is lamented ; but the question is whether the Bill would not be worse than the evil it is proposed to cure. It seems to me simply machinery for procuring billets for certain persons. Under this Bill " Protec- tion Officers " will be appointed. The billets will be given to people of the proper colour. It is quite certain that the presidents of Liberal leagues and ladies' societies that have re- turned certain members to the House on the right side would be appointed as Protection Officers. It does not matter whether they go out into the streets or not. The honourable member for the Suburbs was rather concerned about what would happen from the ladies being out at that time. He need not be the least bit afraid. These ladies will not go out into the streets. Why should they ? They will be ap- pointed ; they will draw their salaries, and that is all they will be required to do. An Hon. MEMBER .- The salaries may be nothing. Mr. HERRIES .- There is no billet without a salary The salaries may be small ; fortu- nately the Government can get services for very litle. Just as a J.P .- ship perhaps gets a good many votes, so would a Protection Officer secure some for the Government. Perhaps they will be allowed to put " P.O."-Protection O)n cer -after their names - " Mrs. Smith, P.O." would sound well. Perhaps they would get no salary, but they will be allowed to put that after their names like J.P.s, and that would be as good as a salary. I quite believe that my friend the mem- ber for Christchurch City is in earnest about the Bill. I know there are many estimable people who are really endeavouring to purify the world, and who will always continue to do so. I sav, all honour to them ; let them continue, and I shall be quite willing to give them a certain amount of power. But what I see in this Bill is that power will be given to those who ought not to have it-that power will be given to Liberal supporters, . ho will not do the work, but will draw the pay. Coming to the question here of the mechanism of the Bill, it seems to me that the more we look at it the more unworkable it seems to be. Under the main provisions of this Bill it is supposed to deal with young boys and girls out in the streets in the evening, and the provisions read well as long as everything goes all right. The Protection Officer goes out and sees a boy or girl walking the street ; he accosts them : if he or she does not see fit to answer properly he is to take them home. But, supposing the boy refuses to answer, or clears out, or says he is over fourteen years of age, no provision is made for dealing with a case of that kind, as being out at night is not an offence at law, nor is it made an offence under this Bill. My own idea is that the children will get to know the Protec- tion Ofheers, and will clear out of their way when they see them coming. Mr. DUNCAN .- Will not that be a good thing ? 
<page:435>
Mr. HERRIES .- No; they will clear from { persons have in consequence of this sort of one street to another. The whole city will | behaviour been before the Court ?- Yes, Sir ; have to be studded with Protection Officers in order to catch the boys and girls. That, no doubt, will be a good thing for the Government, because it will make more billets. It seems to me that this Bill will have to be altered con- siderably in Committee before it can be made workable. I think it would be far better to leave the matter in the hands of the police. As, however, there are some good clauses in the Bill, such as clauses 11 and 12, and as the motive of the Bill is laudable, I will support the second reading of the Bill, and endeavour to' have it made more workable in Committee. Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) .- I must express my regret that there has been even one speech that has cast ridicule upon this Bill, and it is that of the honourable member for the Bay of Plenty ; and I am glad to find that there was only one honourable member joining in the laughter of that honour- able gentleman, and that was the member for Wellington City, Mr. John Hutcheson. I am obliged to members for the manner in which they have approached this subject-one which it is admitted on all hands is full of difficulties, but a question that must be grappled with; and I am gratified to find that honourable members are prepared to take their share of responsi- bility. The question is, Does the evil exist ? Why, the member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) has shown it does exist, although he only mentioned cases which came before the Court, some of which failed. But what of the cases that do not come before any Court ; and what about the evidence he produced to-night ? He quoted from the evidence of two witnesses     -- the Rev. Mr. Paterson and Inspector Pen- der. Why, the Rev. Mr. Paterson was one of the best witnesses we could produce to induce this House to pass the Bill. The mem- ber for Bruce has given some extracts from Inspector Pender's evidence before the Com- mittee of 1897. But there has been a later Committee dealing with this question than the Committee of 1897. In 1899 there was a Com- mittee which sat in another place, and Inspector Pender there confirmed not only everything said before the Committee of 1897, but went even further ; and, while I carefully guarded myself against making any sensational state- ments, or giving any portion of the evidence which might be termed in the least degree offensive, that phase of the question has been touched upon by some honourable gentleman, and I will therefore let the honourable gentle- man know what Inspector Pender, his chief witness, said in 1899. And what did he say? He said there were large numbers of these children about the streets at night ; and he was asked,- "6. Do you consider, then, that this kind of thing leads to immorality ?- Yes, I think it does undoubtedly ; young fellows and girls meet about street corners, and so forth. I see a good deal of it going on, and the language used at such times is often extremely bad. "7. Can you cite any instance where such we had several cases brought before the Court of young girls who were allowed to leave their homes at night, and wandering about the streets, ultimately ending in prostitution. We have had a number of young girls up before the Court at different times. "8. More or less, I suppose, under the age of sixteen years ?- Yes, Sır." Now, that is the chief witness brought for- ward by the honourable member for Welling- ton City (Mr. Fisher) ; and, mark you, this is not a case of New Zealand as compared with any other country at all. I honestly believe this evil exists in other countries, and in nearly every other country, and the only question is, Are we going to do our duty, as representatives of the people, by endeavouring to take some steps to prevent what we know to be going on ? If honourable members can suggest any other way of doing it, let them bring it forward in the shape of a Bill or any other proposal, and I, for one, shall be prepared to support them. The section 1 referred to, in moving the second read- ing of the Bill, summarises the whole position. I will again repeat it for the benefit of those honourable members who have been away this evening,- "Where any Protection Officer finds any young person of either sex habitually loiter- ing in the streets or out-of-the-way places at untimely hours (meaning thereby between nine o'clock at night and five o'clock in the morn- ing), and has reason to believe that such young person is there without proper control, or for immoral purposes, the following provisions shall apply." Now, Sir, what man who wishes well to our country can object to the provisions to meet such cases as are referred to in this 5th clause ? Mr. LAWRY .- What about the "discreet woman"? Mr. HALL-JONES .- It is not a question of the "discreet woman." It is a question of pro- tecting young children ; and I hope my friend Mr. Lawry is at one with myself in wishing to see this done, and I look for his support in passing the Bili. Sir, the criticism of the Bill itself has been small. We have had the criticism of the member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) as to some reflections which were said to have been made with regard to Welling- ton. I hope that all the member for Welling- ton City says is true ; I sincerely hope so. If it is true, what it means is this: the Bill will not be brought into operation in any county or any borough except by Order in Council. If Wel- lington is as it is represented to be - and I do not say it is not - then the Bill will not be brought into operation in Wellington, and the honourable gentleman may rest satisfied. Mr. FISHER .- My remarks did not apply only to Wellington. I said that New Zealand is the most moral of all civilised countries. Mr. HALL-JONES. - Even so; take it that New Zealand is the most moral of all civilised countries on the face of the earth, and you can- 
<page:436>
not get away from the evidence given before the Committee in 1897, and again in 1899. But let me warn honourable members what they are leading up to. Let them read the evidence of 1897 and 1899, and see what is the alterna- tive suggested. It is the enforcement of an Act which a member of the House is now en- deavouring to get repealed. I will not now go into the question of whether or not that should be done, but I say again that where parents are so negligent of the welfare of their chil- dren, and of their children's future, as to allow them to go about the streets to the injury of themselves and those they associate with, then it is the duty of the members of this House, as statesmen, to come to their rescue and see that they are protected. The member for Wellington Suburbs objected to women being engaged as Protection Officers. Well, Sir, it seems to me it is wise to make provision for the ap- pointment of women, even though no women might be appointed ; because, as has been pointed out by, I think, the member for Bruce, women in this work have done all that has been done through the medium of the various organizations that have taken the question up. I believe that good, motherly, women would have greater influence in dealing with young girls than would any man who might have to carry out the work provided for in the Bill. We had the evidence of Inspector Pender on this point. He says that women should be appointed. His evidence on this point was as follows :- "9. If you look at the Bill you will see that it provides for Protection Officers ?- Yes. " 10. And also that these officers may be per- sons of either sex. Now, I want to know your opinion in regard to the advisability of ap- pointing women to discharge duties such as these ? - Well, sir, I do not think that the Act could be properly carried out otherwise." That is the opinion of Inspector Pender, and we know he is a man who has had large ex- perience. He is about at all hours of the day and the night, and his opinion is certainly worthy of the consideration of members of this House. The suggestion by the member for Wel- lington Suburbs that women as officers must necessarily be about at four and five o'clock in the morning, or from nine o'clock in the evening to five o'clock in the morning, is absurd, because the greatest care would require to be exercised between the hours of nine p.m. and midnight, by which time the children would be in their respective homes. The member for Christchurch City (Mr. Ell) suggested that the age should be raised from fourteen years, as stated in the Bill, to sixteen years. Well, I would suggest to the honourable member that he should take the Bill as it is. It is a good Bill. It is a start in what a majority of us believe to be advisable, and I say we should, at any rate for the present, keep to fourteen years of age. The member for Ric- carton suggested that instead of the pro- visions of the Bill there should be arrange- ments made, at any rate for one year, for the ringing of a bell at nine o'clock, so Mr. Hall. Jones that all children should know they were re- quired to go home at that hour, and that if a policeman saw them out after that hour he should send them to their homes. That would mean that the bell would ring, and the policeman send the young people home, and then they would run away to some other part of the town and still be out till any hour. The curfew system would not work. I would ask honourable members, like the honourable mem- ber for the Bay of Plenty, not to treat the Bill with levity. I hope he was not serious in suggesting that this would lead to the appoint- ment of people, as he called it, of the "right colour." I say the successful administration of the provisions of the Bill depends upon the appointment of proper persons as Protection Officers. Without this it would be of no use ; and those who would make appointments of persons to act as Protection Officers are respon- sible to this House, and could be dealt with if the House so thought fit. As regards the statement by the honourable member for Wel. lington City, and also the member for the Bay of Plenty, that the Bill is simply brought forward to waste the time of the House, I have only to point to the long list of Bills upon the Order Paper, and say I am prepared to stop here till daylight, or this time to-morrow night, to try and pass them.

MONEY-LENDERS BILL. Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) .- Sir, I confess that the Bill now before the House deals with a difficult subject. and one which has been legislated for by other countries for ages past. I admit it is 11.0. a Bill dealing with a question that is full of difficulties ; and, Sir, while I say it has been before other countries for hundreds of 
<page:437>
years, almost every country in the civilised world has endeavoured to deal by legislation with the question of usury. I would define the difference between usury and interest as fol- lows : Money lent for a fair return I will call interest, and money lent for an unfair return I call usury. In the Old Country hundreds of years ago usury was prohibited many years ; after a maximum rate of interest was fixed by Act of Parliament; then, from various causes, in 1854 the usury laws of the Old Country were practically repealed. That was followed by a similar course taken in France, Denmark, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, Norway, Saxony, Spain, Belgium, Prussia, and the greater part of Northern Germany ; but, as time went on, the evils were found to be so great that many of these laws were in some form re-enacted. In 1898 a Committee was set up in the Imperial Parliament to inquire as to the best means of dealing with this important question, and in- cluded in their report is the following :- " After carefully considering the evidence which has been given in regard to particular transactions, and the general expressions of opinion of persons so well qualified to form a judgment as Sir Henry Hawkins, Sir James Charles Mathew, Sir George Lewis, the In- spector-General in Bankruptcy, and the County Court Judges, your Committee have unhesitat- ingly come to the conclusion that the system of money-lending by professional money-lenders at high rates of interest is productive of crime, bankruptcy, unfair advantage over other credi-  tors of the borrower, extortion from the bor- rower's family and friends, and other serious injuries to the community. And, although your Committee are satisfied that the system is sometimes honestly conducted, they are of opinion that only in rare cases is a person benefited by a loan obtained from a profes- sional money-lender, and that the evil atten- dant upon the system far outweighs the good. They therefore consider that there is urgent need for the interposition of the Legislature with a view to removing the evil." Sir, an attempt was made in the following year to introduce a Bill dealing with the ques- tion in the Old Country. It did not pass, but a Bill was passed last year in the Imperial Par- liament almost exactly on the same lines as the Bill now before the House. That there is need for it in New Zealand I think cannot be dis- puted. We have had Usury Bills before the House on previous occasions. We had one in 1896 ; and let me say here that what appears to have been the weak point in most of the Acts dealing with usury was that there was fixed in the Act a maximum rate of interest from 10 per cent. down to 4 per cent. per annum. That there is need for it in New Zealand I think is evident to most honourable members. Those members who look through, for instance, the Mercantile and Bankruptcy Gazette will see in that paper the bills of sale which are registered. In quite a recent number of the Mercantile Giazette I noticed a bill of sale over furniture. The borrower was a woman. The amount bor- rowed was $20, and the interest was 20 per cent. In another case £13 was borrowed on a horse, and the interest was 20 per cent. In another case #18 was borrowed on furniture, and the interest again was 20 per cent. That is the interest that was charged ; but if you come to add on to that the charges made by the per- son from whom the money is borrowed you find that in these registered bills of sale the interest amounts to 30 or 40 per cent. But when you come to unregistered bills of sale, and similar documents, you will find that it demands that some safeguards should be provided for those people who, through necessitous or other causes, seek the assistance of the professional money-lender. Now, I had a case brought under my notice not long since which is, I hope, about as extreme as one could find. There was a loan of £5, and again the bor- rower was a woman-a respectable woman. Evidently she wished some money for a par- ticular purpose, and this was the result : She borrowed $5 at 5s. per week interest. At the end of the first year she was unable to keep up the whole of the payments, and had only paid £8 18s. 6d. in interest on the loan of $5. At the end of the second year she had paid £21 8s., and still owed the $5. Owing to the interest being in arrears the charge was raised to 7s. 6d. per week interest, but the loan ran on for over two years and a half. Her husband shortly after- wards happened to hear of it, and the matter was settled. The final settlement was: Interest paid, £31 18s. 6d. ; still claimed to be due by the money-lender, $7 7s. : total, $39 5s. 6d. Deducting the £5 originally borrowed gives £34 5s. 6d., or interest at the rate of 25 per cent. per annum. That may be an extreme case ; but we have had many cases in this colony of people borrowing money at 40 and 60 per cent. interest. An Hon. MEMBER .- Was that bill of sale registered ? Mr. HALL-JONES .- No ; and it is the un- registered bills of sale, or promissory notes, where the highest interest is charged. The honest man suffers from this, because I have numerous instances of men who have got into financial difficulties in connection with their business. They have gone to a professional money-lender, and given a promissory note or some security, which is not registered unless the lender thinks there is some fear of losing what he has lent, and then he registers it to secure himself, and the honest man who is dealing with the debtor has to suffer. I could give you many instances of bankruptcy proceedings where you find secured creditors and unsecured creditors. The secured creditor is the man who has charged 30, 40, and 50 per cent. in- terest, and the unsecured creditor is the man who has to bear the brunt of the heavy charges made by the money-lender. Now, the Bill before the House is not a Bill fixing any rate of interest. It is a Bill which, in a few words, says that a Court may review any case brought before it, and if the Court is of opinion that the charges are excessive, unfair, or extortionate in any way it can enforce a readjustment of the accounts. In the 2nd clause a money-lender is defined thus :- 
<page:438>
"'Money-lender ' includes every person (whe- ther an individual, a firm, a society, or a cor- porate body, whose business is that of money- lending, or who advertises or announces him- self or holds himself out in any way as carrying on that business." The borrower can have the case reopened before a Court, leaving it to the Court to make a fair adjustment as between the parties. This is provided for in section 3. Section 4 provides that a money-lender must be registered, and that is a provision which I think should have been enacted long since. It also provides the penalty for a money-lender who fails to re- gister, or who does not carry on his business in accordance with the provisions of this Bill. The following clauses are machinery clauses, to give effect to the main provisions of the Bill. Then, there is the penalty clause which is cus- tomary in such measures. The penal clause is the same as in the Imperial Act. The Bill itself is almost word for word that of the Im- perial Act. The Bill can be objected to by no honest man, because it simply provides for an honest adjustment as between the borrower and the lender. I move the second reading of the Bill. Mr. HANAN (Invercargill) .- Mr. Speaker, I intend to support this Bill, because I believe in the principle it contains ; but at the same time I intend. in Committee, to endeavour to secure one or two amendments. As this Bill is drawn, Sir, I have no hesitation in saying that if it is carried it will be a complete nullity, and I in- tend to point out to the House and the Minister my reasons for making that statement. In clause 2 we have the definition of the term "money- lender " It goes on to say,- " But does not include- "(1.)

Any person bona fide carrying on the business of banking or insurance or any business not having for its pri- mary object the lending of money, in the course of which and for the pur- poses whereof he lends money." Having regard to the concluding words of the definition in clause 5, it must be plain to honourable members that it is easy for a money-lender to combine with his business some other business. He may be a commis- sion agent, a lawyer, or a shopkeeper. He may say that his business is that of a com- mission agent, and that that is his primary business. Well, under those circumstances, I have no hesitation in saying, without fear of is a useful provision, because, if a man be- Mr. Hall-Jones contradiction, that this Bill does not touch him at all. An Hon. MEMBER .- Why should it touch him ? Mr. HANAN .- I am speaking of the Bill as it is drawn now. I say it is a complete nullity, because it may be evaded in the direction I have indicated -- namely, that a man can com- bine another business with that of money- lending, and he may contend that the money- lending is not his primary business. I think that is plain to any member of the House. What I should like to see in a Bill of this kind is the rate of interest fixed. That is to say, fix a limit of 10 per cent., and --- An Hon. MEMBER .- You cannot do it. Mr. HANAN .-- Allow me to proceed, and I will explain. In other countries a limit has been fixed. What I propose is that where interest over, say, 10 per cent. is charged. at the instance of the borrower, if he considers the amount excessive, application could be made to the Court, which should make inquiry into the transaction and decide what is a fair rate. Where the charge is 10 per cent., or under 10 per cent., there would be no right to apply to the Court. Thirty per cent. may be charged, and, being over 10 per cent., it would be open to the borrower to go to the Court and ask the Court to say whether the charge is fair and reasonable; and the Court, having regard to the transaction and to the risk, will then determine whether the charge is fair and reasonable. The Court may come to the conclusion that 30 per cont. is not too much in that case, and, if so. that amount will be awarded. I do not say there should be a maximum charge of interest fixed, but there should be the limit I have mentioned of 10 per cent. ; and in regard to any amount over the 10 per cent. application could be made to the Court to determine as to its fairness. Mr. HALL-JONES .- No matter who may lend it ? Mr. HANAN. - Yes ; because I cannot see any reason for a distinction. Every person who lends money as a business is a money- lender. At the same time I would not object to some of the exemptions that are made by this Bill. An Hon. MEMBER .- Suppose a couple of pounds is borrowed ? Mr. HANAN .- Well, if the charge is over 10 per cent., it should be open to the Court to inquire into the transaction at the request of the borrower, and say whether the rate of interest demanded is fair, and should be paid. What we want is that the present outrageous rates of interest charged by Shylocks should be diminished -in other words, to relieve necessi- tous borrowers from the heavy obligation to pay usurious interest. Now, this is an exceedingly difficult subject to deal with. Take, for in- { stance, the definition of "interest ": The definition of "interest " should include fine. or renewal charge, otherwise there would be evasions of the Act. It is doubtful whether clause 3 covers that objection. Then, clause 4 
<page:439>
comes a bankrupt, I think the same right to apply to the Court for investigation of interest- charges should be presented as in other cases. Then, I think the clause which makes it com- pulsory for the money-lender to supply a copy of any document relating to a loan or any security therefor, is also a very useful provision. I should like to see a clause in this Bill providing that the money-lender should, in auy document relating to a transaction, state the real annual rate of interest to be charged. In Canada they have a clause in one of their Acts which makes it compulsory that the money- lender shall set forth the annual rate of in- terest ; and the reason for it is this : A person may go to a money-lender and ask him to lend money. He says, "Yes, I will," and the in- terest is 5 per cent. But when the instrument is drawn up, the ignorant or careless borrower finds that he is charged 5 per cent. for a week or a month, and that the annual rate is over 5 per cent. And therefore I say it is desirable, in the interests of the careless and indolent borrowers, that a sum should be fixed in every transaction as the annual rate to be allowed. There should be a clause inserted preventing any one from charging a borrower, in addition to interest, a sum of money for obtaining the money for the borrower from such money-lender. I agree with the penal clause as put in the Bill, but to put other penal clauses in the Bill would, I think, be a step in the wrong direction, because where you provide penalties it simply  means that you are increasing the price of the loan. Moreover, many of the usury laws which have been passed in other countries have proved of little effect, because of the fact that they imposed penalties upon the lender. I may say that last session I urged the Premier to bring in a Usury Prevention Bill, and he promised to do so. I regret to say that this Bill is not satisfactory. We want to strike effectively at usurious interest. It is our duty as law-makers to prevent a money- lender taking grossly unreasonable advantages out of all proportion to the benefit he confers on the borrower. We find that in many coun- tries Acts have been passed to limit the amount of interest. In India the limit is fixed at 12 per cent. ; in Prussia, at 12 per cent. ; in Hun- gary, at 8 per cent .; in many of the United States the rate has been fixed at 6 per cent. In Germany they have usury laws, but no rate of interest is fixed at all; that is left to the Judge to determine ; and if the Hon. the Minister will read the reports in connection with the usury law in Germany he will find that the usury laws in that country do not work satis- factorily, and that one of the main reasons given for that is that the rate of interest is not fixed. Another reason of the failure of the Act in Ger- many is that the Judges who have to administer the law are not, as a rule, conversant with the trade and business to appreciate the real nature of the transactions, into the usurious character of which they have to inquire. I think, as the Bill stands, the Hon. the Minister will agree with me that it is a complete nullity unless he strikes out the latter part of the clause which says, "or any business not having for its primary object the lending of money, in the course of which and for the purposes whereof he lends money." As 1 pointed out, the clause as it stands can be completely evaded by a man combining the business of money-lending with some other business, and make that other busi- ness his primary object. Consequently, a com- mission agent, or a lawyer, or an accountant might lend money ad libitum, and could charge what rates of interest he liked. Then, as re- gards the money-lender, there are various systems of money-lending. A man who backs How is this Bill a bill is a money-lender. going to deal with him ? 1 think the Bill should be so amended that, if the rate of in- terest is more than 10 per cent., the borrower, if he wishes, should be entitled to have the transactions openly investigated, and the Court should say, having regard to the circumstances, whether the charge is fair and reasonable. Of course, it must be remembered that an amount that would be usurious in one case might not be usurious in another. It is obvious, there- fore, that you cannot possibly fix definitely a definition that would apply to all cases. The money-lender would be bound to get his prin- cipal and at least 10 per cent. He might get 50 per cent. if the Court thought it justifiable, having regard to the risk and other circum- stances. I can now, Sir, only repeat my con- tention that this Bill will be a nullity unless something is done in the direction of making amendments of the nature I have indicated. Mr. LAURENSON (Lyttelton). - I think this Bill is a fair attempt to grapple with a very difficult subject ; and, although the last speaker -Mr. Hanan-has pointed out that there are certain things in clause 2 that we must see would have such an effect that a man engaged in money-lending would escape the working of the Act, at the same time I think the clause can be altered so as to embrace all these people. I have in my mind's eye the case of a money- lender. pure and simple, who calls himself a banker, and who is a pure-bred extortionist and sharp, yet under clause 2 he would escape the provisions of this Act as a banker, if you please. The last speaker, I think, said that what is wanted is an Act that will define the legal rato of interest as 10 per cent., and that it would be unlawful to charge anything above that. Mr. HANAN .- No, not unlawful. What I did say was that, if over 10 per cent. was being charged, the borrower should have the oppor- tunity of having the transaction investigated by the Court, which would say what would be fair. Mr. LAURENSON .- Well, of course, that is a very different thing. What I want to point out is that even if you defined a certain rate as legal the money-lender could always get through that clause. For instance, I know of a money- lender who carries on business in this way : He agrees to give a man a loan of $100 for twelve months on bills renewable every three months, with interest at 10 per cent. per annum. On receiving an indorsed promissory note for three months, the money-lender hands the 
<page:440>
months' interest at 10 per cent. per annum, and 24 per cent. for what our Hebrew friend calls " gommission." At the end of the three months the bill is renewed again with interest, and another 2} per cent. for " gommission," and so on until the expiration of the twelve months, when we shall assume the loan is paid. Now, during that twelve months " Ikey Mo " has received $20 for a loan of $95, or just on 32 per cent. per annum ; and yet nominally the money-lender was letting him have that money all the time for 10 per cent., the rate he said he would charge. If we pass only two clauses of this Bill we shall go a long way in the direction of clipping the wings of these people. I refer particularly to clause 3, in which power is given to the Court to review any bargain that may have been made, and if the rate is considered excessive the Court shall then set the agreement on one side, and give justice according to equity and fair-play. short time ago a case was before the Court in Christchurch, in which some 700 per cent., I think, was charged, and the Magistrate-Mr. Beetham -in giving judgment, ordered the man to meet his liability. The money-lender applied to the Court for an order for imprison- ment, and the Magistrate ordered the borrower to pay the money or suffer imprisonment. He said that he had no power to set aside the agreement, but he could, however, say how long the borrower was to have to pay the money. He therefore ordered that the debt should be paid at the rate of 6d. a week, if I  remember correctly, which would enable him to liquidate the debt in a few centuries. If this Bill is amended in Committee in the direction indicated by the honourable member for Inver- cargill, so as to embrace those gentlemen who would otherwise get clear of its operations, and even if we only get clause 3 through, I believe that we would be doing a good service to a sometimes cruelly used class of the community. It often happens that the best and most simple people are at times driven to the money-lender. It is then that they are taken advantage of and fleeced without mercy by human vultures. shall be glad to support the second reading of the Bill. Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) .- Sir, I have noted with interest the remarks of the honourable member for Inver- cargill. He has pointed out one weak point in the Bill, to which I will give attention. With regard to the question of fixing 11.30. a minimum rate of interest : that is what appears to have been the difficulty in all legislation affecting this subject. The experience of other countries where it has been tried is that they have always failed through fixing the rate of interest, and in nearly every instance these laws were repealed, but in several countries were, with modifications, re- enacted. I am aware that in some of the United States the rate of interest is limited, but it does not work out as was intended. As regards the matter of commission agents who may be carrying on this business, and also as to Mr. Laurenson the course of this debate, I shall bear them in mind ; and I hope that, with the assistance of honourable members, we shall get a workable measure on the statute-book that will be for the benefit of the poorest class of people, who are those who most need the protection that will be afforded by this legislation. Bill read a second time. COMPANIES BILL. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) .- Sir, this Bill is intended to bring the companies law in this colony more into line with the Eng- lish law as recently amended there, so as to enable the whole position of the companies in the colony to be put on a better footing. It is a somewhat comprehensive Bill, and it would appear to me that, while I would give a general explanation of the principles of the Bill itself, it might be more convenient to honourable mem- bers to have the clauses of the Bill in detail A fully dealt with in Committee. But I will explain to honourable members the general pur- port of the Bill. For a considerable time past in this colony the whole law relating to com- panies has not been satisfactory. There have been many cases known to honourable members where the Companies Act has caused great injus- tice to be done to companies themselves, to shareholders, and very great difficulty to the people responsible for carrying on the busi- ness, who were anxious to comply with the law, but were frequently unable to do so in a way satisfactory to themselves or to the members of these companies ; and it is desirable that in the Companies Act of this colony the law should be more clearly defined, and consequently better understood by the people as well as by the shareholders of the companies-that we should make the position of directors and shareholders generally more defined. I think this Bill does that, or will do it if it is put on the statute- book, in a way that ought to commend itself to honourable members. The 1st clause of the Bill that requires any explanation from me is clause 3, relating to the certificate of incorpora- tion. I think that if a statutory declaration is I made by a solicitor of the Supreme Court en- gaged in the formation of the company, as set out in subsection (2), or by a person named in the articles of association as a director or secre- tary of the company, of compliance with all or any of the said requisitions, and is produced to the Registrar, that declaration should be ac- cepted by him as sufficient evidence of compli- ance with the law. Mr. MASSEY -- What about subclause (5) of clause 3 ? Sir J. G. WARD .- That subsection deals with a question of repealing, and it is necessary, if the amendment proposed by the clause is given effect to. If the amendment suggested in the clause is given effect to, it will be necessary to repeal section 259 of the principal Act, other- wise there would be an inconsistency in the law. The qualifications of directors are dealt with in clause 4. It is required that they should either sign or file with the Registrar a consent 
<page:441>
should sign the memorandum of association for a number of shares, not less than the qualifica- tion, if any, or sign and file with the Registrar a contract in writing to take from the company and pay for the qualification shares, if any. If the list of persons who have consented to be directors contains the name of any person who has not given his consent, the person who hands in the list shall be liable to a fine of $50. As members know, there have been cases in the colony in which the list of directors has con- tained the names of persons who have not given their consent to act in that capacity. They were never consulted about it, and they had never consented; and to prevent anything of the kind in the future it is advisable that a substantial penalty should be imposed. Sub- clause (3; of clause 4 provides that the section shall not apply to a company registered before the commencement of this Act, or to a com- pany which does not issue any invitation to the public to subscribe for its shares, or to a pro- spectus issued by or on behalf of a company after the expiration of one year from the date at which the company is entitled to commence business. That, I think, is a necessary proviso to have in connection with the company law of the colony. Clause 5 provides that it shall be the duty of every director who is by the regula- tions of the company required to hold a specified share qualification, and is not already qualified, to obtain his qualification within two months after his appointment, or such shorter time as may be fixed by the regulations of the com- pany. Judging by some matters that have been recently brought under the notice of honourable members in the House, a provision of the kind   is certainly required. Regarding the allotment of share capital, there are several important provisoes in the Bill dealing with the matter, both as to the restrictions and the allotment of capital. If members will read the clauses they will find the allotment is safeguarded in a way that should commend itself to the House, and I really do not think that any particular ex- planation is required from me with reference to these clauses. Sir, the Bill has been in the hands of honourable members for a consider- able time past, and doubtless they are as familiar with the whole of the proposals as I am myself. Mr. PIRANI .- What about the audit ? Sir J. G. WARD .- Regarding the question of audit, I am inclined to think it would be a good thing to give the shareholders power if they so desired to have a State audit. Their right to elect private auditors should, of course, re- main. Generally speaking, I may say that the Bill is intended to place the formation of com- panies in the colony on a better and safer footing than has existed hitherto, and if this can be done it would be a very good thing for the country itself, because there are cases in the country at present of important companies who have a great difficulty in currying on their affairs in such a way as the people connected with them would desire ; and if the company law can be brought into line, to insure to share- be on the lines of the English Act, which is incorporated in the Bill, it will be a very desirable thing to do. Mr. GUINNESS (Grey) .- I heartily support the provisions of this Bill. At this late hour it is not to be expected that one should go into the very important amendments proposed in the Companies Act and the amendments thereof. The honourable member has no doubt at- tempted by this legislation to meet the cases of the formation of companies, especially for gold-mining purposes, which recently have been brought under the notice of the public within the last few months. He is attempting to make some reform or alteration of the law, and pre- vent some of the alleged frauds that have taken place. I am not going to take up the time of the House by going into the details of the measure, because I confess at once I have not studied it as carefully as the Minister has. But, with regard to the question of audit, he will no doubt remember that in this Bill he proposes that the audit system shall continue pretty well the same as it is. It is only in cases of neglect to appoint auditors that a member of the company can apply to the Colonial Secretary to appoint an auditor. I think we ought to do in this Bill the same as in the Municipal Cor- porations Act, under which it is provided that the Audit Office shall be the auditor. The com- panies have to pay the cost of the audit, and whether they pay private individuals or a State officer makes very little difference to them. But I submit the appointment of the Audit Office as auditor of all companies will be of great benefit to the colony. If this had been the case many years ago we should not have had the mis- representations and swindles which were per- petrated in Dunedin in regard to the Equitable Insurance Company, for instance. An Hon. MEMBER .- How about West Coast dredging companies ? Mr. GUINNESS .- Nothing has ever been charged against any of the companies floated on the West Coast, but charges have been made against some floated in Dunedin, and I dare say the same remark would apply to some floated in Christchurch. Now, I can say this : that there has not been a breath of suspicion of wrong dealing suggested with regard to the flotation of companies on the Coast. The ground is there ; but the process of floating companies and of gulling the public with regard to some of these claims has been perpetrated by the promoters of these companies in Dunedin, and not on the Coast. The Goldfields and Mines Committee is at the present time inquiring into some of these matters, and before that inquiry is concluded they will thoroughly go into the whole question of the manner in which this Companies Act is worked for the purpose of deceiving the public. I think the Minister would do wisely to agree to remit this Bill to the Goldfields and Mines Committee to go through it clause by clause. That Com- mittee is not a small one-it is one of the largest in the House-and I think, if that were done, that Committee might make very 
<page:442>
proposals. I can only say that I entirely sup- port the principle of the measure-that is, to amend the Companies Act and its amendments with a view to safeguarding the public in the investment of capital in mining and other ventures; but I say that this amendment should be made with great caution, considera- tion, and deliberation, and the best way to do that is to refer it to some Committee. An Hon. MEMBER .- Why the Mines Com- mittee ? Mr. GUINNESS. - I suggest the Mines Com- mittee because they are now making an ex- haustive inquiry into the working of this Act. There are more companies registered for gold- ming purposes under this Act than for any other particular purpose, and therefore it more particularly affects that industry. No honourable member can make any objection to sending this Bill to the Mines Committee, because, when the report of that Committee comes before the House, we shall have the benefit of that Committee's suggestions ; and then also members will have a knowledge of the other industries that are incorporated under the Companies Act, and take advantage of that Act, and in Committee of the Whole they will be able to give their experience, and make further amendments if required. Mr. McNAB (Mataura) .- Sir, I do not think the honourable member in charge of the Bill should follow out the advice given by the last speaker namely, to send this measure to the Goldfields Committee. And the reason I make  that suggestion is this: that this is a Bill dealing with the company law generally ; and, granted that there is the necessity for intro- ducing legislation to prevent a recurrence of     the abuses in connection with company pro- moting that has occurred in the Otago Dis- trict during the last twelve months, it is very questionable indeed - in fact, I think it is highly improper-that the legislation which we are bringing down to prevent a recurrence of that should penalise company promoting in other directions, and in regard to which it has never . been suggested that these evils have occurred. While this Bill follows the English legislation, and, I think, makes some very important and useful changes in the law, I do not think that it will be found to meet the Otago difficulties and the West Coast difficulties that were referred to. What I think should be done is that, when the Goldfields Commit- tee have done with the witnesses that they are examining at the present time, either the Minister of Mines or the honourable gentleman in charge of this Bill should introduce such legislation as the Committee recommends affect- ing those companies registered under "The Companies Act, 1882," or " The Mining Com- panies Act, 1894," and which carry on gold- mining operations, and limit the restrictive legislation, which it has been shown ought to be passed by this House, purely to those com- panies that carry on gold-mining as an occupa- tion. I do not think the law ought to impose upon all companies the restrictions which, as I | be done in cases like that, in regard to gold- Mr. Guinness necessity to require in this colony. Coming to the Bill, however, there are one or two points I want to refer the honourable gentleman to, and one of them is contained in clause 10. That clause provides that certain commissions and discounts may be allowed to any person or com- pany "in consideration of his subscribing or agreeing to subscribe, whether absolutely or conditionally, for any shares in the company, or procuring or agreeing to procure subscrip- tions, whether absolute or conditional, for any shares in the company ;" and then, in subsec- tion (2) it goes on to state that payment only is to be made as warranted in subsection (1)-that is, that these payments and charges must be set out in the prospectus, otherwise they are not allowed to be made. But if the honourable gentleman will look at subsection (3) he will find this section will not affect the power of any company to pay such brokerage as it has heretofore been lawful for a company to pay. Now, I understand that this section was intro- duced in this form on account of the English law and practice, which draws clear distinction between a broker and a commission agent, and where the two departments of company-float- ing are kept clear and distinct. In this colony the distinction between the two is lost sight of, and under the practice in this colony sub- section (3) of section 10 would neutralise the other two subsections. It is different in Eng- land ; but I am sure, owing to the want of that system in this colony, that would be its opera- tion, and it will be necessary to strike out sub- section (3). Then, referring to section 12, the question of promoters' shares comes up, and I want to point out to the honourable gentleman a difficulty that has arisen owing to last year's legislation in connection with this question of promoters' shares. Last year we imposed by the Companies Act Amendment Act certain limitations upon promoters' shares, and in section 2 of "The Companies Act Amendment Act, 1900,' subsection (3), occurs the following : " Shares given in lieu of cash in payment of any property acquired by the company shall not be deemed to be promoters' shares within the meaning of this section." Now, here is what takes place : A man secures an option over a property for gold-mining, and a consideration of, say, £10 per acre is promised for the land. After he secures the option he sells that option to a company. The consideration for the purchase by the company is the payment of that #10 per acre to the vendor of the land, and the payment of shares in lieu of cash to the vendor of the option of, say, fifteen hundred fully paid-up shares. Not one of these shares will then come in under this definition of promoters' shares, because given in lieu of cash ; and the result is that only in a case of bad draftsmanship by the lawyer who has to deal with it is there a single promoter's share Therefore the restrictions in a company. imposed by the Act of last year do not apply to proper promoters' shares, and they can be disposed of at once. What I think ought to 
<page:443>
paying in cash or in fully paid up shares, if they exercise that option and pay in fully paid up shares, then those fully paid up shares should be considered promoters' shares, and the limitations on promoters' shares under the Act of last year ought to apply to them. Then, provision ought to be made to meet this case : In the amended Mining Companies Act of 1894, it is provided that every company registered under that Act, and every company registered under any other Act that is engaged in mining, has to file an account in the Gazette every year up to the 31st December, giving a number of particulars, and amongst the particulars that this company has to file are what are supposed to be full particulars about its debts. The 4th Schedule of the Act specifies that it has to show all the debts due to the company ; debts which are considered good due to the company ; and, thirdly, any contingent liabilities of the company to anybody else. And, strange to say, the Schedule does not provide that the debts of the company due to any outsider have to be specified at all. The result is that the company may be indebted to outsiders to the extent of $9,000 or .₺10,000, and that fact is not disclosed. If the company, however, has only got a con- tingent liability of $1, that fact has got to be shown in its statement of accounts. The fol lowing is the extract from the Schedule to which I refer : " Debts : Showing the amount of debts directly due to the company ; the amount of debts considered good ; the amount of the contingent liabilities of the company (if any)." Now, it is scarcely conceivable that any of the companies have any contingent liabilities at all. They may have a great number of liabilities, but not contingent liabilities, and the important information that the public want is what is the indebtedness of the company on the 31st December; and there ought to be introduced into this Bill an addition to the Schedule of the Mining Com- panies Act of 1894, specifying that every com- pany has, in addition to the other information, to specify the debts of the company due to any person. Just looking over the Bill, these are some of the points that struck me that legis- lation is necessary for ; and I think the honour- able gentleman in charge of the Bill will do well to keep clear of a general Companies Bill in legislation which the experience of the last twelve months of gold-dredging in Otago has shown to be necessary for the gold-dredging companies of the colony, and to put on the statute-book of the colony this Bill, derived from the English Act, with the modifications that the New Zealand experience has shown to be necessary. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston) .- Sir, before the Minister replies. there are just two points I want to make. One is in reference to the balance-sheets of companies. I do not think there is anything worse in connection with the Companies Act than the so-called balance- sheets issued to shareholders. I defy anybody not a director of the company to obtain a proper statement of the accounts of any limited liability company from the balance-sheet as. published. Only the other day I was going into the balance-sheet of a company with a turnover of nearly $100,000 a year, and in the balance-sheet the highest account showed a turnover of $28,000. As a matter of fact, it did not give the gross expenditure or receipts in the balance-sheet, and it was impossible to judge from the balance-sheet without an inspection of the books what business the company was doing. The greatest safeguard against swindling in a company is a full statement of the receipts and expenditure of that company. No audit in the world is equal to a full statement of accounts. Take, for instance, our colony : If the Govern- ment had to put in the particulars of every single voucher in the returns to be laid before this House, showing what the money was paid for, and what the articles were required for, there would be such a sensation throughout the colony that we would very soon see a very great reduction in our annual expenditure. It is to a very great extent the same in connection with companies. I think, if companies were forced by legislation to publish the whole of their receipts and expenditure it would be very much better for the companies, and there would be fewer bogus companies that we hear so much about. Of course, it is urged that it would be a wrong thing to compel a company to expose all its business to the public. But my experience is this: that, unless a com- pany has got something to conceal, no harm ever occurred to a public concern by the fact of its published accounts being made full and complete. In regard to the question of audit, the member for the Grey touched on a point that I wish the Minister to deal with. The member for the Grey told us that there have been no such unfair transactions on the West Coast as had occurred in Dunedin in connection with dredging companies. We know of one case which came before the Supreme Court. It was a case of "salting" on the West Coast, where a term of imprisonment was meted out in connec- tion with the swindling of a company on the West Coast. There have been no such cases in Dunedin. An Hon. MEMBER .- That does not come under the Companies Act. Mr. PIRANI. - I do not know what it comes under, but it ought to come under some Act. It shows there have been concerns on the West Coast whose affairs were not carried on in accordance with honest dealing. So far as dredging companies there are concerned, I do not think the member for the Grey could tell us of any that has been able to pay a dividend. Mr. GUINNESS. - Yes, several. Mr. PIRANI .- Well, they have not come to my ears. I know very many companies that have not. An Hon. MEMBER .- Have you been in any of them ? Mr. PIRANI .- Unfortunately, I have been in one, and that is about enough for me; but friends of mine have had some remarkable ex- periences with regard to dredging companies on the West Coast, so that I do not think that 
<page:444>
Dunedin in that respect. As a matter of fact, the question of gambling comes into all mining companies, whether dredging or any other, and my opinion is that the man who loses his money in a mining concern proves the saying, that "a fool and his money are pretty soon parted." If a man goes into a mining specu- lation he ought to know that the chances are about, say, ninety-nine to one whether he will get his money out of it again. But I do think the Government ought to take into its own hands, as the member for the Grey urged, the question of the audit of companies' balance-sheets. Of course, that would necessi- tate the employment of very many more au- ditors, but we should get a very much better system than obtains at present. What is the present system ? That practically the directors of a company appoint the auditor to audit the directors' accounts. Of course, theoretically the shareholders appoint the auditor ; but in the majority of instances the auditor is selected by the directors, and the auditor would be a very great fool indeed if he went out of his way to injure his prospects of re-election. But, to my mind, the best cure in connection with com- panies would be to put them all on the principle of those mining companies where there is no liability- An Hon. MEMBER .- Bring them under the Mining Companies Act. Mr. PIRANI .- I would go further, and say that a man's liability shall cease in regard to a public company when he thinks he has paid  enough. Yes ; it is all very well for the member for Wakatipu to smile at that. An Hon. MEMBER .- There is a class of com- panies.     Mr. PIRANI .- Yes, there is a class of com- panies in existence at present. But I want to place all on the same footing, because I say that you do not hear tales of swindling in con- nection with these no-liability companies that you hear in connection with the ordinary limited liability companies. I know it is not a popular thing to advocate. I mooted it in this House once before, and I have no doubt that at the present time it would not receive much support. But, Sir, I believe the time will come when the greatest check upon this misrepresentation and swindling in regard to public companies would be to put them in such a position that the directors of the company should be the persons who would be liable in the case of the failure of the company to carry out the expectations formed or set forth in the issue of the prospectus. An Hon. MEMBER. - Then we should get no directors. Mr. PIRANI .- Well, you will always find directors if it is a genuine concern, no matter what the liability is. But you will get no directors for a number of these speculative con- corns that are simply got up to sell shares and gull the public. I feel certain that if this prin- ciple were extended to the majority of companies they would be found to work very much better than at present; because, if the concern was Mr. Pirami those who take up shares, very good care will be taken that their shares will be paid up, so that if the affair does turn out all right they will be able to reap their reward. Then the directors would not enter into any liabilities beyond the cash that was in hand. There would be no prospective liabilities ; there would be no making large expenditure on the chance that they would in the future be able to call up further capital; and I am certain that would be one of the greatest benefits, at any rate in connection with dredging companies, that you could possibly have. I hope the Minister will give seine further attention in connection with the system of audit, because the present system is not working as satisfactorily as it ought ; and it is the duty of the House, while giving every encouragement to the formation of limited- liability companies, to offer every protection it can possibly afford to those who take up shares in these companies. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways). - Sir, as to the point raised by the honourable member for Mataura regarding the adjustment of brokerage, I think he is quite right there. It seems to me that the proper thing would be to eliminate subsection (3) altogether from the Bill, and then there would be what was originally intended as provided in subsection (2) of clause 10. Upon the question of keeping the mining companies entirely separate from the Companies Act I quite agree with the honour- able member. It seems to me it is desirable that the Mining Companies Act should not be mixed up with the general Companies Act, and that it would be necessary to have a special Act for mining alone, with certain provisions of a suitable character imposed regarding mining operations in the colony, which would not apply to companies generally. As to the point raised by the honourable member for Palmerston, I may say that, personally, I am in favour of Government audit. I think it would be a good thing to allow the shareholders to elect a Government auditor if they wished, and there is no reason why reputable private firms could not in some way be certificated Government auditors, and I should be quite prepared to take the sense of the House when this Bill is in Committee upon the question. I think a com- pany should have the right to elect private or Government auditors by vote of the shareholders as the shareholders thought proper. I look upon it that the best safeguard for the companies and the shareholders, as well as for the people who are doing business for those companies, is to have a reliable audit, and I should be quite prepared to consider such a proposal, although, as I say, shareholders should not be deprived of their right, if they so desire, to elect an auditor or auditors. I should support giving the power for the shareholders to have Govern- ment audit upon proper lines. I do not think there has been any point raised in connec- tion with the principles of the Bill itself to which I need reply. As I have said, it is in- tended to put the company law of the colony upon a better footing. The Bill is before the 
<page:445>
there from another place ; and I have no doubt that, with the careful consideration it will re- ceive there, and the revision the Bill will also undergo in Committee, every effort will be made to make the law as perfect as possible. Bill read a second time, and referred to the Statutes Revision Committee. The House adjourned at a quarter past twelve o'clock a.m. LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. Friday, 16th August, 1901. First Reading-Shops and Offices Bill. The Hon. the SPEAKER took the chair at half-past two o'clock. PRAYERS. FIRST READING. Presbyterian Church of New Zealand Bill. SHOPS AND OFFICES BILL. ADJOURNED DEBATE. The Hon. Mr. RIGG .- Sir, I confess that I was not affected to the extent that I might have been by the fervent appeal of the Hon. Mr. Shrimski last evening in regard to the wel- fare of the poor people of the colony, for the reason that I have heard the same story before, and very frequently since I entered this Council. I might point out for the information of the honourable gentleman that that cry was raised over half a century ago against the factory legis- lation introduced in England, and it has done duty ever since for the opponents of all labour measures. If the poor people of New Zealand required a champion in a matter of this sort, I would be one to come forward to champion their cause, for the reason that I was once a poor man myself, and, as I may probably be in that position again some day, I speak with a full sense of responsibility when I say that it is better that these poor people should be working for those who are capable of paying them a fair wage than that they should be engaged in a com- petition which is not only disastrous to them- selves, but also to others. If there are poor people who cannot engage in fair competition, either in trade or in the labour-market, then I say it is the duty of the State to find them employ- ment, or to give them charitable aid. That is the way to deal with poor people, and I am one of those who are always willing to do what they can to bring that about. What surprised me most in the course of this debate was the remarkable speech delivered by the Hon. Mr. Jennings. I could hardly believe that I was listening to the speech of one who has been regarded as a representative of labour in this Chamber. From the heat that characterized it, the speech seemed to me to be rather that of one bitterly opposed to labour legislation of any kind. I know that is not so, because the honour- able gentleman has supported labour legislation in the past, more or less. But I intend to dwell for a few minutes on some of the statements warned the Council that it must give the most serious consideration to this measure, and he indicated that if any one would move in the direction of throwing the Bill out he would vote with him. But surely the honourable gentleman must be aware that this is the second time this Bill has been before the Council. It has been before it three times, but not perhaps in the same form as it is at present. Last year the Bill was much more stringent in its provisions than it is now, and in that more stringent form it passed through the Council. As regards the Bill we are now considering, in the Labour Bills Committee an endeavour has been made to meet every reason- able objection on the part of employers through- out the colony. And yet in the face of that we are told we must give the most serious con- sideration to the measure. And why? Be- cause there is going to be a revulsion of feel- ing. Now, who is going to revel-may I be permitted to say, who is going to " revulsh " ? Is it the workers who are affected by the Bill, and who are going to be benefited by having their hours shortened and by pay- ment for overtime ? Surely it is not the employers, because they must then become in favour of the Bill, as they have hitherto always been against legislation of this kind, although, as I shall show later on, it has been for their benefit in some cases, which they have acknowledged. But when this revul- sion of feeling takes place, then something is going to happen. I want to know what it is. The ominous tones of the Hon. Mr. Jennings would lead one to believe that it is going to be something fearful. Well, I am one of those who cannot be frightened by a bogey. If there is a danger to be faced I want to know what it is, and so I say, let this terrible thing come on, whatever it is. The bigger it is the better, for the simple reason that, as Josh Billings says, " You can dodge an elephant, but you can't dodge a flea." Let it come on, and we will meet it in the same spirit, I hope, that we have met objections of that kind in the past. Then, the honourable gentleman proceeded to say, in a most dramatic way, that he would sooner retire from political life than force down the throats of the people what they do not want. I am afraid the honourable gentleman said rather more than he intended. The Hon. Mr. JENNINGS .- No, he did not. The Hon. Mr. RIGG .- Then, I should say his time in this Council will be exceedingly limited. There is no law passed in any Parliament which is not against the desire and wish of some per- sonor class of persons, and it follows as a mat. ter of course that you must, in order to benefit those you desire to benefit, force unsatisfactory legislation upon another class of the community. So that we see his dramatic statement when it is analysed does not amount to very much. Let us take, for instance, people who live in un- healthy premises surrounded by insanitary con- ditions. They have low rents to pay, and so they are quite prepared to live on under those conditions. They do not want to be interfered 
<page:446>
which gives the right of interference to certain officers appointed, and those people are forced to live cleanly and to have their dwellings im- proved. Then, we have a compulsory law deal- ing with the attendance of children at school. The children do not want to go to school, and their parents are indifferent ; but the law says that the parents must send these children to school ; and so in that case, too, we are forcing legislation down the throats of people who do not want it. And so I might point out instances to reduce the argument to an absurdity : for instance, that the punishment provided for every crime is objected to by the persons who are likely to receive the punish- ment. Formy part, I say this : that when I can no longer fight for the interests of the working- people of this country I will retire from Par- liament. But that is not likely to happen. Now, Sir, we are asked why should legislation be forced upon the bank clerks, who say, by their petition, that they do not want it. Well, the reason is that it is for the good of the community it should be passed. Long hours and overwork tend to degenerate the race, and we have a per- fect right to say to any class of the community, " If you are injuring your health, and endanger- ing the physique of the race, by working long hours and overtime, you shall not do it." And it is on that ground, the ground of the general good, that we take our stand in advocating measures of this kind. Now, why should long hours be worked in any establishment ? Either the number of hands employed is insufficient, or the persons employed are incompetent. It may be that in some cases there is not sufficient accommodation supplied, but that shows simply a want of enterprise upon the part of the firm or institution, as the case may be ; because long hours mean greater expense in many directions, and therefore it is not true economy. If it is not true economy, then it is false economy. False economy I regard as a phase of bad management. There is nothing to justify the employment of incom- petent hands. There are plenty of men able and willing to do work in any class of employ- ment. Very often the desire for cheap labour overcomes the prudence of a manager, and he takes cheap labour and indifferent work and long hours in preference to less hours, more effective work, and fair wages. Now, some- thing was said about the number of petitions that have been brought forward, signed by per- sons opposed to this Bill. Well, let us take a sample one. Here is the petition of A. H. Chappell and a hundred other employés in retailers' shops in Auckland, praying the Coun- cil to eliminate from the Shops and Offices Bill the clauses dealing with shops. Now, what does that mean? It means that these persons want the existing law to be repealed, and that they desire to be deprived of the weekly half holiday they have enjoyed for some years past. Does any one believe that the employes who signed that petition knew what they were sign- ing. or, if they did, that they were in earnest ? That, Sir, was a petition which was presented Hon. Mr. Rigg not responsible for what it contains, but, still, he cites the petitions presented as an argument for opposing the provisions of the Bill. The Hon. Mr. JENNINGS .- I never cited that petition at all. The Hon. Mr. RIGG .- No; you did not men- tion any particular petition, but you referred to the number of petitions. The Hon. Mr. Jenkin son showed pretty clearly there was a consider- able amount of ignorance with regard to the Bill on the part of those members who have spoken in opposition to it. He rightly said that the Bill was a consolidation Bill, and that the greater portion of it is already existing law ; that there is very little departure as regards any extension contained in the Bill, but the main feature of it is that the machinery which was provided to carry out the existing law has been found defective, and this Bill renders it more perfect and effective. There is no part of the machinery under the existing law which has proved so defective as that relating to banks and offices. And who is responsible for the in- troduction of that principle into the Act? That did not come as part of the Liberal policy of the Government. It was not introduced by any Liberal representative in Parliament. It was introduced by the Hon. Mr. Ormond. An Hon. MEMBER .- What is it ? The Hon. Mr. RIGG .- The provision relating to the closing of offices at certain hours. Now, I do not think there are many members of the Council who would not receive a law coming from a gentleman like the Hon. Mr. Ormond with respect, and if the machinery to carry out that law is defective, that they would hesitate to provide the proper machinery in order to carry out what was the intention of the honourable gentleman and of the Legislature. A new principle of some importance in the Bill is the one providing that shops shall be closed on four days a week at six o'clock. Now, that came into the Bill owing to the large number of communications received from employers and trading associations throughout the colony, and from evidence given by employers before the Labour Bills Committee. It was a well- meant attempt on the part of the Committee to meet the wishes of the employers, and that has been referred to, and it has been opposed ; and it has been said by the Hon. Mr. Jennings that the question should be made one to which the principle of local option should be applied. Well, I do not suppose that we would have had a weekly half-holiday now if the question had been left to local option. It was found necessary, then, that the State should make it compulsory ; and therefore I am quite sure that, viewed in the light of experi- ence, it will be found necessary to make this daily closing at six o'clock also compulsory. As regards the warehouses and their exemption from the Bill by the Labour Bills Committee, 1 do not at all agree with it. I was under the im- pression until recently that there was very little overtime worked in the wholesale houses, but I have been very much undeceived. Since this Bill has been before the Labour Bills Commit- 
<page:447>
number of warehouses, all within a short dis- tance of each other in Wellington, lighted from basement to ceiling in the evening. I am in- formed that this goes on nearly all the year round. Well, then, there is just as much reason why the hours of labour should be cur- tailed in wholesale warehouses as they should be curtailed in the shops. Now, I want to draw attention to a somewhat important point, and that is this: that the opposition to this measure is the result of organization on the part of the employers; and i venture to say that you will see the same oppo- sition from the same people against other labour measures that will come before Parlia- ment during this session. 1 regard it as an attack upon the Labour policy of the Govern- ment, and I feel sure that if they do happen to succeed-which they will not-the attack will then be directed to another part of the policy of the Government, with a view to ultimately overturning the Liberal and Labour party. This organization has been brought about to some extent by the operations of another Act which we passed, for the employers are better organized now than they have ever been in New Zealand. The same thing may be said of the workers. But the knowledge of their new-born power and strength is not compensated for by the experience which would enable them to use it wisely. At the present time they are like a boy who has got a loaded pistol in his hand for the first time, and he wants to go out and shoot something. Well, it may be, perhaps,  an old weapon, and when, through want of experience, he fires it off it bursts. And so I think, in regard to this organization of em- plovers that has taken place, and the way it is being used, the employers are making a very great mistake. It would be better for them to meet the organizations of employés in a more conciliatory spirit, and endeavour to bring about a mutual understanding in regard to matters affecting them. I have found in my experience, and have always said so, that where you get good organizations of employers and good organizations of workers you will have fewer labour disputes and less difficulty in adjusting any difference of opinion that may arise. But here is what I cannot allow to pass without expressing my feeling in regard to it: that a certain section of the Press is doing its best to stir up the employers throughout the country, and it is endeavouring to find arguments for them against labour legislation of any descrip- tion. I do not say that is so of the Press generally, but it is true of a section that we have in this colony-a section of the Press that will grovel to any " fat man " who is in a position to give it advertisements, and therefore they place before the welfare of the people the profits which they expect to receive. And so we are told there has been too much labour legislation in the past. Now, I would ask honourable gentlemen to consider what new labour legislation has been passed since 1894. There has been the Workers' Compensa- tion for Accidents Act. The other Acts have already in existence ; and vet we are told that there is far too much labour legislation, and that it is being ridden to death. Well, I say, without hesitation, there is no proof that such is the case, and that the labour legislation of recent years has been more a matter of soleing and heeling, and patching up and making per- fect. And what has been the result of all this labour legislation ? Can any one point to an employer who has been injured by the opera- tion of the Shops and Shop-assistants Act? Sir, it has been to the benefit of the em- ployer, who enjoys his half holiday as much as his employés do. His business is com- pressed within narrower limits, and there is greater economy ; and I have no hesitation in saving that if the six-o'clock hour of closing is adopted it will help him to regulate his busi- ness better, and will also be to his advantage, and that before many years are over he will recognise the benefit, as he has done in the case of the weekly half-holiday. And, then, with re- gard to the revulsion of feeling we are warned against : We know that in all parties and all organizations there are certain weak-kneed people. In fact, some people have such a natural weakness in their knees that they can- not walk without wobbling, and so we must expect that those who are weak in resolution or wanting in moral courage will fall away from the ranks of any organization where opposition is met with. Well, I say let it be so. It is not the tree that possesses the greatest number of limbs that bears the greatest quantity of fruit, and the pruning-knife is beneficially applied to any fruit-tree in a judicious way; so that I consider that the cutting of a certain number down will tend to make the remainder more vigorous and more determined. It has been so in all reform movements, and I believe it will be so Therefore I would say to those in the future. responsible for the introduction of the labour policy be not discouraged by an agitation got up in the way I have stated, and backed up by a section of the Press. Let it come, and we will meet it when it comes with a reasonable and philosophie mind and with determination. We have to consider that in legislating on the lines we have been doing for some time past that we are legislating not for to-day, nor for to-morrow, nor for the day after, but for the future; and if that legislation is, as I believe it to be, in the direction of uplifting the people of the country and making them more prosperous and more happy, then we should continue in that light. Then, not only shall we make this a happy and prosperous country, but we shall set an example which older countries will follow to their very great advantage. The Hon. Mr. TWOMEY .- Next to the man who thoroughly agrees with me I admire the whole-hearted unrelenting thorough man. Of course, the man who agrees with me is always, in my estimation, wiser than any one else, but the next man is the thorough man, and in the Hon. Mr. Rigg I have found him. It was refreshing, after the speeches delivered by other honour- able gentlemen who have an equal claim to re- 
<page:448>
present labour as he has, to find him standing here insisting on legislation being shoved down the throats of unwilling people. That is the position. He has pointed out to us that other Acts have worked in this direction, and he instanced the Education Act. He said the Education Act had been shoved down the throats of parents who did not wish their I can see no analogy · children to go to school. at all between the two Acts, for the reason that the education of the children of the State is for the purpose of elevating the citizens of the State, and making them better citizens and better men and women. Now, there is no analogy between that and bank clerks, who come in the proportion of 90 per cent. and say, " We don't want any holiday ; we want no interfer- ence such as you are offering. Let us alone ; we don't want it." Very well. I was under the impression that they did want it ; but if they, as my honourable friend Mr. Pinkerton pointed out the other evening, have not the pluck and manliness to come here and say they want it, let them do without it. That is com- mon-sense, and it is neither common-sense nor good practice to try to make them accept that which they do not want. Now, of course, there have been petitions read ; but I have got here a private letter-I will not give the name-from a banker friend of mine. This is what he says,- " As the petitions point out, they would be denied holidays with pay, and other privileges which are much valued. Still, there is some- thing that should and could be done for bank officials if the House is sincere in its efforts to benefit them. The work at the half-yearly balance periods is always trying, and it could be very much lightened by allowing the banks to close for one day-the day after balance-day. If this were done, and two of the present holi- days were cancelled to make up for it, bank officers would thoroughly appreciate the relief it would give. It would mean they could get rid of the urgent work on the day after balance- day, instead of working late for many nights. The night-work also would be reduced by about half, and would not be felt tiresome or injurious as it is at present. No greater boon could be conferred on bank officials, and if you could carry it into effect you would earn lasting gratitude." I do not think that much need be said about the bankers. I think that part of the Bill is as dead as Julius Cæsar ; consequently, I will not speak of it any further ; but I will ask, Where did this originate? Who promoted the in- clusion of bank clerks in this Bill? We have had labour legislation, and we knew where it originated. We knew that it originated in the fact that there was " sweating " in this country. But here is a measure introduced and no one can say where it originated. An Hon. MEMBER. - Read Mr. Tregear's evidence. The Hon. Mr. TWOMEY. - I have the greatest respect for Mr. Tregear. I think he is a very efficient officer, and he is doing good work, but I think that he need not listen to every tale he is told and try to reduce it to Hon. Mr. Twomey legislation. But this is the point: here is legislation brought before us which evidently nobody wants. And the effect of it is this : it is creating irritation. I look upon the position as rather serious. We find that on one side a party has been organized, and that it is a strong organization, and we see that there is another party organizing now, and it will be an unfortunate affair if there is a serious conflict between those two parties. If there is, the colony will suffer. Bringing forward such legislation as this is Let bank creating distrust and irritation. officers come here and say that they want this I am as legislation and I shall vote for it. ready to vote in favour of bank clerks as any- body else ; but if they do not want this pro- vision why should you interfere with them ? Then, we come to another cause, and that is. with reference to wholesale warehouses. They say they do not want it. How did this originate ? Nobody seems to know. I have received letters from these people, and they say they do not want it. I went into a shop to buy some little thing, and I will tell honour- able members what actually happened. Some of the shopmen came up to me and asked me to oppose this point of the Bill, which, they said, would be detrimental to them. They referred, of course, to the payment for overtime. They say they get a week's holiday every year, and that they appreciate it, because they get all the time at once, so that they can go away and enjoy themselves. They also get sick- pay, and if they wanted a day off for any purpose they get it and are paid for it. But, they say, if overtime has to be paid for, every one of these benefits will be stopped, and they will be bound to the letter of the law ; and therefore they do not want payment. for overtime. Now, these men may be en- gaged by a good employer, and, of course, there may be other employers who are not so con- siderate towards their employés; it may be they are "sweating " their employés. Well, let us have evidence of it, and if there is evidence of it we should legislate to prevent people being crushed. Certainly, if I get evidence of it I will vote for redressing any grievance of the kind. But if the true state of affairs is. that the employers treat their employés well, and in such a way that the employés do not want any interference on their behalf, why should we interfere? Then, something was said about the clamour that was got up when the Shop Hours Bill was first introduced ; but, Sir, I think there was no clamour at all, and I do not think there was ever an Act of Parlia- ment passed that had a more widespread public support than that measure. Hon. MEMBERS .- Oh, no. The Hon. Mr. TWOMEY. - Yes, it is so ; and for this reason : In Dunedin, Christchurch, and all over they were holding the half-holiday before the Act was passed at all. In the face of that fact, what did the Government do but give legislative effect to a custom that already ex- isted ? It may be the holiday was not observed in Wellington. What I am stating is a fact as 
<page:449>
to what occurred down South. It occurred in my own town. Therefore I say that legislation under those circumstances was different from the present case. A man might keep his shop open and thus gain an advantage over his fellow- men, and to prevent that it was necessary to give legislative effect to the holiday. I say, then, that if it is shown to me that there is " sweating," or any wrong-doing, I will do what I can to put a stop to it; but when people we are supposed to be benefiting come to us and say they do not want our help, I say, " Very well, we will not ask you to have it." Sir, I consider the best speech made in this dis- cussion was that of the Hon. Mr. Bolt. He referred to clause 25, in which it is provided that an employer should keep an overtime-book when he works his employés at night. An Hon. MEMBER .- What is the good of it ? The Hon. Mr. TWOMEY .- The good of it is this : that if that book is kept and is subjected to inspection the employer will take care that there is nothing wrong to report about him, because he will say to himself, " If it appears in this book that I am overworking my men, and that I am keeping too long hours, the Inspector will report and Parliament will pass a law to prevent my doing so." That will be the effect. Now, the very fact of seeing this ahead of him will cause him to be more care- ful with regard to his employés. I think that book would be a sufficient check for the time being - together with the other checks that are already passed into law. Of course, we are told that this has been placed before us as a consolidation measure. Well. there is a good deal of consolidation in it, but we see a good many black lines in it, and the black   lines are always attached to new matter, and it is the new matter that is objected to. As regards the sneer at my honourable friend Mr. Jennings about his resigning, there are two threatened resignations already in con- nection with this subject. Now, I am not going to be rash, but when I see people being dragged here from Invercargill and from Auckland to give evidence against things that people do not ask for, and never wanted, I ask myself, how can I, who have always sup- ported labour measures, now oppose this ? and how can I see these people brought every day from all parts of the colony to give evidence upon these matters ? It makes a man feel as if he would wish to retire rather than have the annoyance of seeing these things. If there is anything wrong, there is no man living would be more willing to right it than I. I shall sup- port the motion that the Bill go into Com- mittee, but I shall certainly support the Com- mittee in the amendments they have made, and I shall consider seriously whether there are not further amendments to be made. I shall sup- port clause 25, for making the employer keep an overtime - book. I think that is the best pro- vision in it. I certainly cannot support the bank clerks being included, nor can I support warehousemen -- An Hon. MEMBER. - Will you support Go- vernment clerks ? VOL. CXVII .- 28. The Hon. Mr. TWOMEY .- I shall give seri- ous consideration to any arguments the honour- able gentleman may bring forward in favour of that, and I shall deliver as fair and honest a judgment upon them as I am capable of. That is all I can promise the honourable gentleman just now. I am sorry to have to say it, because there are few men who have a greater admira- tion for the present Government than I have, but I would suggest to them to be more careful, and not to irritate or annoy or provoke too seri- ous an opposition-not that they need fear it ; but we know that a conflict between factions such as I have already hinted at would result disastrously, and have serious effects on the colony. We know that one firm has already cleared out of the colony, owing, they say, to the labour legislation. If that goes on, I would ask, who will suffer ? They will lose something by leaving, no doubt ; but what about their employés ? What will happen to them ? They will be thrown out on the world ; and I do not mind indulging in a bit of prophecy, if this is carried too far. I say they will be thrown out on the world, and will then come to the em- ployers offering to work for less wages, and these Acts will break down under their own weight, and the final result will be serious to the workers themselves. I say the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is one of the finest Acts ever put on the statute-book, and I would work tooth and nail to keep it there ; but if the employers are to be harassed as they are at present the day will come when that Act will be wiped out. I am giving this warning, for what I now say may be heard outside this Chamber. The employés are working that Act to death. I myself have had no reason to complain about it, although I have got to understand it. I think we have now a Judge who will be the greatest friend of labour that New Zealand has ever seen. The way in which he will befriend labour will be in the direction of repressing the wantonness of labour. He has exercised his powers judicially so far, I think, and I only hope that, for the sake of the labourers themselves, he will discourage their unnecessarily using this Act. If he does that, and keeps them reasonable, that Act will live, and it will become a blessing to labour ; but if ever they go so far as to break down that Act, then I do not know what will happen, but the result must be very serious indeed for labour. Once it is broken down, it is broken down for ever. Honourable gentlemen will, I hope, par- don me for digressing from the subject-matter of the Bill before this Council, but I think that it is well that these subjects should be taken into consideration seriously, and that every one who has influence with labour unions should warn them to be more careful as to how they proceed. The Hon. Mr. SCOTLAND .- After all that has been said on this subject I find that there is very little left for me to say. I am afraid that I cannot go the length of the Hon. Mr. Twomey's charity and vote for the further pro- gress of the Bill ; at the same time, I have not made up my mind which way I shall vote. 
<page:450>
Days ago, before this Bill came here, I said to myself, when I considered the number of peti- tions pouring in against it, that Bill is doomed. It will have to go the way of other Bills that have been brought before this Council, not only by this Government, but by previous Govern- ments also, which were not called for, and which were not for the good of the colony gene- rally or any single section of the community. Sir, I know that Bills have from time to time been introduced into this Council by Govern- ments for a particular reason. We who are "in the know "-to use a sporting phrase- are perfectly well aware what that reason was, but the people of the country as a whole were not aware of it. I really think that it is far from wise for any Govern- ment to bring a Bill into this Chamber, well knowing beforehand that it certainly will not pass, that it was not wanted, and could only come to an untimely end. According to the old saying " Familiarity breeds contempt." and I do not think it is right to accustom the generality of people in the country to point to the igno- minious failure of any Bill sent to the Council by the Government, and to see posted in the public Press another defeat of the Government over some ridiculous Bill or other -teaching grandmothers to suck eggs or something of that kind. Well, I do not think that any Govern- ment, however strong it may be, or appears to be, is able to endure these repeated shocks. Individually they may seem very small, very trivial, but it seems to me that if too often repeated these things must tend to bring a Government into contempt, and to lessen its influence in the country. It is dangerous playing with fire, according to another old saying; and I may say, with all due respect, that I think the Government ought to be very careful what measures it brings before either branch of the Legislature. It should not bring forward Bills with a jaunty air and just put them down, saying, practically, " Do what you like with them." Any honour- able gentleman who represents the Government may make an eloquent speech, a very pretty piece of special pleading, trying to make the best of a bad cause, but I think it is risky. I cannot at all agree with what the Hon. Mr. Rigg said just now in criticizing the Hon. Mr. Jen- nings's speech. To me the Hon. Mr. Jennings spoke nothing but common-sense. Neither do I think the Hon. Mr. Rigg is justified in even hinting an aspersion upon any member of this Council, who does not think as he does on this Bill, as not answering to the description of a true Liberal. For my own part, if I may speak of myself, I am not a party man. I do not think that under any circumstances I could be- come a party man. I have been many years in this Council now, and I can take my conscience to witness that I have never opposed any Bill from factious motives ; never because it was brought in by this or that Government, or by this or that individual. I have always taken the Bills solely upon their merits, and therefore I am sure the honourable gentle- man cannot with justice call me a bad Hon. Mr. Scotland Liberal because I vote against this Bill. Sir, the Hon. Mr. Jennings and all the other honourable members who have spoken against this Bill have, in my opinion, spoken nothing but what is true, and according to common- sense. We see that the Bill is not wanted. It has never been asked for ; and why, therefore, should they have obnoxious legislation thrust upon them any more than any other section of the community ? What will be the result of this mischievous Bill, as I call it, if it were passed ? Why, it may even be the means of creating an estrangement between employers and employed. It may put bad thoughts into the heads of some young clerks. They might. begin to think there was really something in this suggestion that they were, after all, not the well-treated people they thought them- selves to be, but that they were very ill-used and overworked. The generality of the per- sons affected be this Bill, however, are men of superior intelligence, many of them very highly educated men, and therefore they are not perhaps likely to be influenced by the pro- fessional agitator, as some other people are in the colony. The working-men as a rule, I think it will be admitted, are not highly educated. There are many highly intelligent working-men, I know, but those are just the men who would treat with contempt the professional agitator, hired at so much a day. It is a very good thing for the country there are such intelligent men among the working class, who are not likely to be influenced by pernicious advice. I do not think I have anything more to say. With regard to conciliation and arbitration, of course there is nothing bearing upon that in the Bill ; but still, as the subject has been touched upon by other speakers, I think I am entitled to sav a few words. I do think we are now approaching a very critical time in the history of industrial pursuits in this country, and of industrial disputes too. I say it is a very critical time, and it is not yet possible to see the end and the result of this feeling of unrest which is prevailing throughout the colony just now. How it will end no one can say. It mav end with a terrible collapse that very few may be able at present to take the measure of. Sir, I think that our whole system of conciliation and arbitration has been very ill-judged, and I am afraid it will come to grief. I have often regretted that something like the French system has not been adopted in this country instead of that which we have. I cannot see, for my part-although I am not engaged in industrial pursuits myself-why it should not succeed in this country, except that we are not French, and we will pursue our own methods, which are not always of the wisest. The system in France is so very simple. The Conseil des Prudhommes, con- sisting of so many employers on the one side and so many operatives on the other, meet together men who thoroughly understand the business from each point of view, and men not above listening patiently to the arguments of the other side, and having the question discussed from both points of view- 
<page:451>
and their agreements are wise agreements, be- cause they answer the purpose for which the Conseil meets-that is, of conciliation. That I should like to see adopted in New Zealand, but I fear, for the reason I have already given, that we are not Frenchmen, we should there- fore set our faces against it. But if this arbi- tration and conciliation system of ours should break down, I do hope that something will be tried as nearly as possible in the same direction as the French system. The Hon. Mr. JENNINGS .- I wish to make a personal explanation, Sir, in reference to some remarks made by the Hon. Mr. Rigg. I think that gentleman misunderstood me - he certainly has misquoted me. I never said any- thing at all about a revulsion of feeling, or that I was afraid of a revulsion of feeling. Those who know me best in Otago and in Auckland will tell you that I have stood in the front rank in regard to public questions, when not popular, when many who are now enjoying a great share of the loaves and fishes stood under cover and were in the background. Now, Sir, I wish that my honourable friend, who certainly talks cleverly, and who frequently succeeds in getting his opponents into "chancery," was en- dowed with binocular power of vision, so that he could see correctly on this question. He, un- fortunately, looks at these labour questions from one point of view. What I have stood up for in this Council-not to-day, but four and five years ago - was that mutuality should be cultivated between the employer and the em- ployé. I do not think that the only link to exist between master and workman should be merely that of wages. An attempt was made to crush me for holding those opinions, but I am #cc-zero still here, and I venture to say that I stand fairly well in the good opinion of the com- munity of New Zealand. The Hon. Mr. McLEAN .- It has been said, Sir, that we passed a much stronger Bill than this last session, and therefore why should not we pass this. We live and learn. We are all being educated, Sir, and we now see dangers ahead which perhaps we did not see last year. Now, Sir, take my honourable friend the Hon. Mr. Rigg, and I would say, as a warning to him, that he must look at this question from other sides than the side of labour only, because the circumstances that he ignores are conducive to the interests of labour. I venture to say that if the honourable gentleman were to succeed in getting his way in regard to the making of la . s in a very short time half the industries of this colony would be shut up, and we would have people walking about the streets with no work to do, and we should have to find employment for them, whereas they should have been hard at work on good pay, and earning good livings for themselves and families. It is this Council that has to take into consideration the interests of labour, the interests of the country settlers, and the interests of the industries of this colony, and endeavour to weld them together so that every one shall be as happy as we can make them. Sir, that honourable gentleman finds fault with the Hon. Mr. Jennings, but who is the man who is held in respect by the employers and the employes? And you must so weld employers and employed together that all their interests shall be in common, and the good you do shall be dis- tributed equally on both sides ; and, forsooth, it is said with regard to those who try to mould these labour Bills to be fair to the people of the colony, and to bring prosperity on the colony, that they are the enemies of labour. Sir, I ask you to take any one of those men who employ labour largely, and see their actions in regard to that labour, and then say whether they have not the interests of the workers at heart quite as much as those who harangue in the open street. Well, Mr. Jennings has done good work in the City of Auckland, and he did good work for the workers in Dunedin be- fore he went there, and his efforts to bring about a better feeling between employer and employé deserves encouragement instead of jeers. Now, Sir, the honourable gentleman talked about revulsion of feeling. I say there is no necessity to have a revulsion of feeling ; but does he think for a moment that the country settlers are going to sit quietly and see the prices being raised on everything they require, while they can get nothing that they require done ? There are no eight hours a day for those settlers and their families. The London market rules the price of their produce, and they can only give a certain amount of wages to raise that produce for export. Sir, the result of all this labour legislation will be that things will be brought to a standstill if the farmers are not able to find labour at fair rates in order to enable them to raise their crops. Therefore, Sir, it is useless to say that the farmers, who are now rising to a sense of their importance, have. no great interest in these matters. Sir, I can tell of a case that has been mentioned to me in regard to the labour legislation of last year which may surprise some honourable mem- bers. Last year we passed the Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act. Now, we hear of the case of a farmer with eighty acres of land, who put a man who came pleading for a job at work on a hedge, but instead of slashing the hedge he slashed his legs, and is now bringing an action to recover $200 damages against the farmer. If he gets that $300 it will be the farmer and his family who will be on the streets, and not the labourer. Sir, in view of all these things, is it not natural to expect that these people will begin to look to their interests ? I say we should be fair here, and should endea- vour to make our laws fair to every person in New Zealand, and let every one have a fair show. Now, Sir, there has been an endeavour to pass an Apprentice Bill but it could not get through the Legislature. But the Arbitration Court is getting above the Legislature. Mind you, in speaking of the Arbitration Court, although I have pointed out its likely de- fects, there is no man who would glory more in its success than I would, because who amongst us would care to see strife or to uphold strikes if we can do without them? I say no large employer of labour ever cares to be interested 
<page:452>
in strikes, and he will go a long way in | the stuff, in the same way as the bootmakers arbitration before resorting to them. Well, Sir, what will be the effects of its action ? If they only allow one apprentice to three or four journeymen, which is now being done, how are the industries of this colony to be carried on, to say nothing at all about an increase of industries ? If we were to allow the young people of this colony to be trained as they ought to be trained, what need would there be to send $200.000 to America for a lot of rolling- stock, badly made and unsuitable, each car- riage weighing 34 cwt. more, and costing a larger sum than those manufactured here ? Why, under an award of the Arbitration Court, I know the case of a respectable man in Dun- edin who has two sons he wishes to take into his business, and for two years he cannot take them in. They have done with their schooling, and, forsooth, they will have to knock about the streets, and become vagabonds instead of being at work, in consequence of this class of legisla- tion. It is wrong that legislation should say to the young men of this colony, when they want to learn a certain trade, "This trade is full ; you must go to learn something else," and when they go to another trade they are told the same thing. There is no room for them; and what are they to do, where are they to go? Let us come to the practi- cal point. Let us take the boot trade. That is the largest trade in New Zealand, and it has the biggest and strongest union or federa- tion in the colony. What is the condition of that trade now ? One large employer in Dunedin had about two hundred hands in his employ. but he has not half that number now, and his case is not singular. American boots and boots from other countries have been deluging this country, and our industries are being ruined In this matter, Sir, the Arbitration Court has taken a great and a wise departure. But, when the flood-gates are open, is it easy to stem the current ? What has the Arbitration Court done ? Seeing the position of this trade, they have abolished, as I understand, the restric- tions on machinery, which was the great curse of the whole thing, and they have allowed every emplover to manage his own affairs as he feels disposed, so long as he does not pay below a certain rate of wages. Well, there is some hope of the industry being saved from annihilation, and if the Arbitration Court succeeds they will have done a good work. Well, Sir, there are other industries just as much in jeopardy as the one I have mentioned : and can we stand by and pass these Bills at this stage? For myself I do not think there is very much in this Bill that any one should care so much about. There are some good things in it. There is a certain fear created amongst employers, and a worry exists that is not good for trade. Although we have known employers exaggerate what is to happen to them, yet if they take fright we do not know what may occur. The Hon. Mr. Rigg said that this was a want of energy on the part of employers. Well, if the employers are to be worried and harassed like the bootmakers they will import Hon. Mr. McLean have imported theirs. Therefore, Sir, although there might not be much harm in this Bill, I hope for a season we shall be content. It is the constant bringing-forward of these labour laws that is causing the general irritation, and it is said that the Govern- ment are the cause of the labour laws. It does not matter what Government may be in power, the labour laws will have to go on, and any flaws found in their working must be recti- fied. Something has been said about the head of the department. The head of the depart- ment has been very judicious in working the Acts. He has not dragged cases into Court as he might have done. He has handled his In- spectors carefully, and lots of difficulties have to my knowledge been smoothed over instead of taking cases into Court. It is that sort of gentleman that we should have in that position : but I think he should get resolutions from both employers and employés before he proposes amendments of the law, and then he would not. produce one-sided laws such as he sometimes proposes now. When the one-sidedness of these Bills is pointed out to him he sees the folly of them himself. I see in these laws a danger, and probably this Bill should be de- layed until we see what might be brought forth in the shape of abuses by the keeping of an overtime-book. I think these new clauses should, at all events, stand over. There is this great danger in pressing the matter too strongly : that employers will commence to think that if they are to be treated in this way they will say to their employés. "So far shalt thou go and no farther ; you shall have that which the law allows you, but no more." Thus we shall have a state of matters that we should not have. Every one should try to promote good feeling between employers and emploves, and not stir up strife. I think that too much strife is being stirred up in the Arbitration Court, for I never see much of the conciliation part my- self. Of course, there are some good Conciha- tion Boards and some bad ones, and it is not fair to class them all together. Some have done good work, and have settled a good many cases without having to send them to the Arbitration Court at all. There are others, however, that are undoubtedly sur- ring up strife in order to keep matters going. Such conduct as that, we know, can only end in the extinction of the Boards. The Boards should therefore have fair warning not to draw out disputes that might be settled without causing irritation. I am sorry, Sir, to have to take up the time of the House so long, but I consider it behoves every one, now that the feel- ing is getting somewhat exaggerated, to try to prevent the irritation going further, and to smooth the differences there are existing be- tween the employers and employés, and, above all things, we should try to keep our industries in the colony going, so that work may be found for our people. Our people should be educated to do the work. It should not be necessary when times get brisk to have to send to Australia, or elsewhere, for men. We should avoid that by- 
<page:453>
people for the work there is for them to do in the colony. It is only by so doing that we shall uphold our colony and its interests, and stand well before the world. The Hon. Mr. JONES .- Sir, the honourable gentleman who has just sat down has given us one of his old-fashioned homilies on industrial matters and the responsibilities which rest upon us in regard to labour and capital. Sir, I was very glad to hear the honourable gentleman say that we should do our utmost to conciliate as between employers and employés, because the honourable gentleman in expressing such a sentiment gives his sanction to the legislation which has been passed by the Legislature of this country. The tendency of that legislation, as has been generally admitted, not only in the colony but by outsiders, has been to create har- mony between masters and men. The honour- able gentleman referred -though it was some- what outside the subject- - to the fact that a farm-labourer had slashed his leg while cutting a hedge, and was going to bring an action against i is employer under the Workers' Com- pensation for Accidents Act. One cannot tell what view the Judge before whom this action may be brought may take of the matter, but I know it was never intended that agricultural labourers should be included in the Act. That was pointed out at the time the measure was passed, as will be found in the speeches that were given, and, more than that, the Premier has also stated that the intention was that farm  labourers should be exempted. An Hon. MEMBER .- He said he would have them all in this year. The Hon. Mr. JONES .- Well, I do not know what the intentions of the right honourable gentleman are, but I know what he said when the Act was passed. Then, the honourable member also spoke to-day about the restrictions in regard to apprentices, and I consider that what he said in that respect was quite reason- able. If we had the wages and the hours of labour fixed there is no necessity at all to restrict the number of apprentices. But the honourable gentleman then spoke of the effect the measure is likely to have on employers in the colony, or the influence that any inju- dicious legislation in regard to industrial pur- suits may have on the employers of the colony. He went on to say that a large order had been sent out of the colony for boots. Now, what I want to point out is this : that the honourable gentleman, and those who think with him on this matter, have successfully time after time prevented a measure from passing this Legis- lature in order to stipulate that boys should be apprenticed. And what is the effect of the non-apprenticeship of boys ? It is this, Sir: that we cannot compete with America and other countries in the making of boots. There is hardly a bootmaker in this town who is capable of making a sewn boot that would do him credit and the wearer justice. At all events, if there be any such, one has great difficulty in finding them. Now, Sir, in regard to the measure which is before us: When I heard make his last speech in regard to it I felt that he had made the best of a bad business. No doubt, Sir, his position is an exceedingly difficult one, and I question whether there is another gentleman in this Council, or in Parliament, who could have so wisely, judi- ciously, and delicately placed the matter before the Council. But, Sir, my course in regard to this Bill seems to me to be plain. If we had not taken evidence in regard to the measure I should have thought I understood all about the evil with which it deals. I should have thought I knew what the clerks in the banks and offices in this colony desired to have. But we have taken the evidence, and we have taken it as a guide to our action, and I say that we must act in accordance with what it appears to indicate. I say " appears to indicate " advisedly, because I feel that the petitions that have been sent to us may not be worth as much as we could de- sire. It might be, and it has often happened under similar circumstances, that an employé, when he is desired to sign his name, is met with the demand, which may be mandatory, " Sign your name there, please!" Now, is it likely that an employe-having no trade, perhaps, but simply able to do clerical work -would by refusing to sign his name at the request of his employer court dismissal, and thus be in want of sustenance for himself and perhaps for his family? Sir, every clerk who refused to sign his name would be saying in effect, "I am overworked and underpaid," because it is just exactly overwork and underpay that this Bill proposes to deal with. Sir, the evidence was a pleasant surprise to me. I did not think it possible that there could have been so much unanimity amongst any particular class in the colony ; and I hope that they have been acting entirely upon their own initiative and their own convictions, and have not been driven to take this view of the question by an implied necessity in order to retain their positions. To assert that they were in dread that if they did not sign the petitions and act in accordance with the views of their employers they would suffer, might be doing an injustice to all con- cerned. I am only showing that where you have such a system of obtaining the wishes of servants there is a danger that they may be acting through fear under terrorism. There is one thing that the action of the clerks has proved to my mind, and that is that they have a sturdy devotion to duty, and that they con- sider it unmanly to complain. That is the view I took when I saw the action they were adopting with regard to this measure. Sir, I have said that the evidence was a pleasant surprise, for it demonstrated that the employés not only in the banks but also in the warehouses were a happy family- the lion and the lamb were, as it were, lying down together. I hope the lamb was not in- side the lion, as that too often happens. I want here to emphasize the fact that, in re- gard to all such legislation as this, similar ob- jections have been raised from the very begin- ning. All the legislation we have had for 
<page:454>
improving the condition of the workers of this colony has been met with the same objections on the part of the employers. But what is one to do? The clerks declare that they do not want our good offices. They say, " Go elsewhere with your beneficent intentions, we do not need legislative interference on our behalf ; we belong not to the wages masses, but to the salaried classes." I shall take the hint that has been so indignantly given, and therefore vote, so far as the banks are con- cerned, to leave them severely alone, believing that the time will come when clerks will deem it necessary, unless their condition has in the meantime been voluntarily ameliorated by their employers, to come asking us to take action on their behalf. It has been asked why a piebiseite of the clerks and of others involved in this question was not taken ; but, as I have already pointed out, there is not much en- couragement to take a plebiscite when you cannot get at the true convictions or the true desires of those interested. The voice, Sir, may be the voice of Jacob, but the hand the hand of Esau. Some remarks have been made by honourable gentlemen on the injudiciousness, and even the immoral tendency, of allowing clerks and others to get away to play tennis and croquet, and indulge in other pastimes in the afternoons, and to work in the evenings in order to make up for the time lost. I cannot sympathize with honourable gentlemen who can take such a view of the matter. In my opinion, young men should be encouraged  to get out into the sunshine to have a little pleasant exercise, even if they have to work an hour or two in the evening to make up for it. At the same time I admit that it might lead to mischief where there is an evil design on the part of employers to overwork and to "sacat " their employés ; but I do hope that such a thing does not exist in the colony, and that it never will exist amongst the managers of our financial institutions. Now, with regard to the proposed shop legislation, I contend that the legislation with regard to shops in this measure will be to the advantage of all concerned. It places all the shopkeepers on a common level, both small and great. But the shop-assistants as a whole will not be benefited by it so much as one might think. They will work quite as long hours as they work now. We, however, want to bring the small shops into line with the others, and that is why I take it this legislation is sought to be passed. It has been stated that there has been a curtailment in this measure of the hours of adult labour for the first time in this colony. Well, Sir, the Bill lays down that a man may work fifty - two hours a week, excluding meal-times-eleven hours one day of the week, and nine hours on the other days; and that he may work ninety hours a year at stock-taking. The pay in some cases is ridiculous. In the case of girls it is 4s. a week ; for boys under seventeen, 5s. ; and for other shop-assistants under twenty, 6s. It has been said by those who are opposing this measure that the legislation just now sought with regard to shops is going to play sad havoc Hon. Mr. Jones with industrial conditions in this colony. But how can that be? In the first place it only refers to shops-the mere distributers-not to manufacturers ; and in the second place there is no attempt to increase wages. How much do those who set up this theory think ought to be paid as wages, and how many hours would they like the poor drudges to work ? Notwith- standing that we must admire what has been done in regard to labour legislation in this colony in the past, the adult assistants in shops throughout the colony have been sadly neglected and cruelly treated. I am therefore pleased that, although the concession which is being made to them is not a very great one, some concession is being made to them. I listened with intense emotion to the pathetic appeal that was made by the Hon. Mr. Shrimski on behalf of the small shopkeepers ; but I would point out that we have as much right to consider those who are engaged in the large shops as we have to consider the small shopkeepers or any other class, and it is to meet the condition of the great majority of those who work in the large establishments that this Bill is being brought in. It will be readily understood that we could not possibly allow any class of shops, whether great or small, to escape the restrictions which are contained in this Bill without doing incalculable injury to the whole of the shop- keepers and shop-assistants. It is clear to my mind that if the honourable gentlemen who pointed out that we could not do anything in regard to the banks or warehouses wish to be consistent, they must support the legislation which is being suggested in regard to the shop-, because the reason for omitting the banks and warehouses from the Bill is that satisfactory evidence has been given against their inclusion. It must be obvious that the evidence which has been given and the desire which has been expressed for the inclusion of the shops are just as strong and binding upon us. In regard to warehouses, there are only two provisions now in the Bill -- one as to sanitation and the other as to keeping the extra-time books. Well, Sir, the provisions with regard to sanitation are admirable, and absolutely necessary ; but with regard to the extra-time books, which some honourable gentlemen seem to have placed so much reliance on, I must say that I consider they will be utterly useless. Who is to keep these time-books? Who is to see that they are honestly kept ? It will surely occur to honourable gentlemen's minds that there can be no reliance placed on books kept under the circumstances. Why, it would be neces- sary to have a State official at every book in order to see that the entries were properly made. I am now going to read a letter which I received from a respected citizen of Wel- lington in regard to a certain matter which I think is met by the clauses in the Bill :- "I have read the Evening Post's digest of the Shops and Offices Bill, and I do not see that it provides a remedy against certain prac- tices now existing. There are in Wellington tea-rooms established by certain drapers in their business premises, and as part of their 
<page:455>
supposed to get the Wednesday half-holiday, the same as the other employés. But it is the custom in at least one of them for the employer and others about the shop to come up into the tea-room on the Wednesday, sometimes as late as a quarter to two, for their lunch, and this cuts heavily into the half-holiday. Again, on the day of the Duke's reception the tea-room staff were kept in attendance to serve out tea, et cetera, to certain guests of the firm who occupied seats on the verandah, so that they got no holiday that week. I would suggest a few words in the Bill to stop this state of things, by providing that on holidays no customer shall be served after a certain time say, 12.45 p.m., and that otherwise the tea- room shall be closed when the shop is closed by law." I think the difficulty, or evil, mentioned in this communication is met by a provision in the Bill, but I thought I ought to read it to emphasize the necessity for such provision being made. As may be gleaned from what I have said, I am going to vote for this Bill to go into Committee, and when it gets into Committee I shall use my discretion and my best endeavours to make it a useful measure. The Hon. Colonel PITT. - The Hon. Mr. McLean, in his opening remarks in the speech which he made on this Bill, expressed in very able language his opinion as to the relations which should exist between employers and em- ployed. I do not suppose, Sir, that there is any one who will take any exception whatever to the sentiments which the honourable gentle- man expressed on this occasion. He went on to criticize the labour policy of the Govern- ment, and certain measures which were in existence and on the statute-book, and I was listening, Sir, with considerable attention to see how the honourable gentleman applied his remarks to the Bill before the Council, and what did I find ? That the honourable gentle- man said that he did not think there was much in this present Bill to object to. Sir, I agree with him, and I think that this ought to be the opinion of most honourable members of this Council. I have been very much surprised indeed at the tone of the present debate. I recollect what the debate was upon this Bill last session, when it passed ! into the Bill ? Why should they be excluded ? this Council for the second time, I believe. Most of our time was taken up then in reference to a class of people who have not been referred to at all in this debate, and who į there any one who has had any doubt whatever of all others, in my opinion, are entitled to more consideration than any of those who have been referred to by the members who have spoken. I refer to hotelkeepers. Now, if we accept the general principle that the State has the right to regulate hours of labour so that they shall be for the good of all, we ought to apply it fairly all round, and I would like to ask what right have we to interfere with the shop- keeper, with the hotelkeeper, and with others whom this Bill does interfere with, and leave the bankers and the wholesale warehousemen alone ? So far as my recollection carries me, ence to the Bill of last session ; but it is a very strange thing that-although we are quite pre- pared, or were prepared last year, to touch the small man, the small retail trader, the men in the small shops - immediately we begin to touch the large corporations and moneyed institutions we are flooded with petitions against the Bill. An Hon. MEMBER .- Quite right, too. The Hon. Colonel PITT .- Exactly; and I was very much surprised indeed, in listening to the remarks of many honourable members who supported this Bill strongly last year, to see how readily they are prepared to give way in the face of these petitions in favour of the bankers and in favour of the wholesale warehousemen. An Hon. MEMBER .- The whole class. The Hon. Colonel PITT .-- Well, we shall see presently. And, Sir, I should like to ask, How far is this Bill going to interfere with this class? It gives them an additional hour's time in which their offices may be kept open. They may be kept open another hour under this Bill ; but the one thing which has excited the whole of this opposition to the Bill, and which has drawn the attention of these institu- tions to it, is the fact that they have to pay overtime. And, Sir, the honourable gentleman who has just interjected- the Hon. Mr. Lee Smith - in his speech proved the case for the Bill by the remarks he addressed to this Council. He said he had been intrusted with some hundred and fifty petitions against the Bill. He told us that, as he had been intrusted with some hundred and fifty petitions again .t the Bill, he ought to express his opinion upon it ; and what did the honourable gentle- man tell us? He confessed that in times past there had been reason for interference, that there had been abuses in reference i to the employés in the banks, but that as soon as the matter had been talked about in this Council there had been a great reform in this respect. And, Sir, what did we hear in the debate this afternoon? The Hon. Mr. Mclean says, " Let us see what the extra-time book brings forth." The Hon. Mr. Twomey says, " Let us have an extra-time book to guard against abuses." Well, Sir, what I want to ask is, Why should we not bring these institutions Sir, I was surprised to hear the Hon. Mr. Jones say that he was prepared to leave banks alone because they asked to be left alone. Sir, is that if there is one class of the community ! who are overworked and underpaid it is these employés in the banks ? The Hon. Mr. PINKERTON. - Why do they not say so ? The Hon. Colonel PITT. - My honourable friend says, " Why do they not say so ? " Well, I think the honourable gentleman has sufficient common-sense and has lived long enough in the worl ! to know that persons very often are not in a position to speak their minds. The Hon. Mr. A. LEE SMITH. - There is a great difficulty in getting clerks now. 
<page:456>
The Hon. Colonel PITT .- Very well, I say what I think, with a full sense of responsibility, and I venture to say that if honourable gentle- men will speak their minds they will agree with me in what I have said. The Hon. Mr. JENNINGS .- No. The Hon. Colonel PITT .- Well, I respect the honourable gentleman's opinion. Now, as re- gards warehouses, we had evidence on behalf of warehousemen before the Labour Bills Commit- tee, and what did it amount to ? Why, Sir, that the overtime in the warehouses, so far as it was represented to us-and I suppose we must take it that it was truthfully represented to us - was a very small matter. I think one gentle- man, and a very intelligent gentleman-Mr. Arneil, who put their case very well indeed before the Labour Bills Committee-told us that the overtime was from a minimum of three to four hours per month to twenty-four hours per month ; and what was represented was that, if we insisted upon this Bill being passed the excellent relations existing between employers and employés in the warehouses would be destroyed. Well, Sir, I quite agree with what has been expressed by the Hon. the Minister in charge of the Bill-that it is absurd to say that because the employers will have to pay an amount for overtime it will interfere with the relations existing between them at the "present time. I refuse to believe for a single instant that it will make the slightest differ- ence between employers and employés in the wholesale warehouses. Their position simply amounts to this-and it is just the same in reference to the banks : " Let us alone ; we do not want the Legislature to interfere with us at all." There are a great many people in the     community who do not want to be interfered with, and who say, as the Hon. Mr. Jennings pointed out, "Let us alone." And, Sir, I am surprised to see how differently honourable gentlemen can look at this question of inter- ference. We had an instance only a couple of days ago. The country settler said, " Do not interfere with me transferring my lease," and the honourable gentlemen said, " You must be interfered with, and you must not be allowed to do anything of the kind." But, Sir, when the banker comes round, and the wholesale warehouseman comes round, and says, "I do not want to be interfered with," they say, " Why should they be interfered with ?" An Hon. MEMBER .- Interfered with to their detriment. The Hon. Colonel PITT .-- " To their detri- ment ?" We have got to consider what is best in the interests of the whole community, and that is the reason why I, for one, shall vote for the second reading of this Bill. Once you admit that you are going to interfere with anybody under the Bill, then I say you must make the interference apply all round. Now, Sir, the Hon. Mr. MeLean in his argument instanced the boot trade, and said that the result of the labour legislation had been practically to de. stroy the boot trade, which, I understood him to say, was now being attempted to be saved by some decision of the Arbitration Court. circumstances other than labour legislation altogether. Hon. MEMBERS .- NO. The Hon. Colonel PITT .- Then, I put this to the honourable gentleman : We have heard a great deal about America dominating the boot trade. Why is that? It is because they have in America better machinery, and because they can specialise and work in certain lines which those in the boot trade in this colony do not possess, and cannot work in the same way. The consequence is, and any one in the boot trade will tell you, that the American manu- facturers can produce, owing to the conditions of labour and the use of the machinery there, in such large quantities that they can actually afford to dispose of portions of their surplus stock almost for nothing in this colony. An Hon. MEMBER .- They have blocked the use of the machinery in this country. The Hon. Colonel PITT .- That may be. I am not prepared to say anything upon that point, but I do say that is the reason why. An Hon. MEMBER .- NO. The Hon. Colonel PITT .- Well, I will invite the honourable gentleman to read the evidence given before the Federation Commission by all the bootmakers in this colony, and he will find what the opinion of those who, I venture to say, know what they are talking about is upon that point. It is the facility of production by means of machinery in America and in the Colonies of Australia that has brought the boot trade to the condition in which it is in this colony. An Hon. MEMBER .- Why cannot we do the same here as in Australia ? The Hon. Colonel PITT .- Because we have not the machinery. An Hon. MEMBER .- You will not give us a show to use it. The Hon. Colonel PITT. - I do not wish to occupy the time of the Council longer upon this matter. I have expressed, I think, all that I intended to say when I rose. I shall support the second reading of the Bill, and I shall support the clauses in the Bill in reference to the banks and the warehouses ; and if those clauses are omitted from the Bill, well, then, I should not be sorry to see the whole Bill thrown out altogether. The Hon. Mr. A. LEE SMITH .- As a matter of personal explanation, I think the honourable gentleman has misunderstood me. When I got up to speak about the gentlemen in the banks and their overwork it was with regard not to this being imposed on them, but that these men, being opposed to legislative interference, had taken the precaution by this Bill being before the Council last year to alter their methods, and they now did less work at nights. But the main contention on my part was that the banks, having special work to do on account of the mail and other busy days, must neces- sarily have more than the time allowed by the Act. The Hon. Mr. T. KELLY .- I had made up my mind not to speak on this question, be- 
<page:457>
But to begin where the Hon. Colonel Pitt left off, in regard to the boot trade, it is easily ·explained why Americans can send boots here and undersell the manufacturers in New Zea- land. America is a protected country, and does not allow importation of foreign boots. The boot-manufacturers have an immense home trade, and supply boots to eighty millions in America. Consequently, they produce on an enormous scale, employ first-class machinery, and to keep their machines running are willing to export at cost price. They dispose of their surplus all over the world at a low price. You can buy American boots in New Zealand at a cheaper price than the American user can ob- tain them in America. In regard to agricul- tural machinery, you can buy reapers-and- binders of American manufacture in New Zea- land cheaper than the American farmer can in America. The reason of this is because the American home trade is protected by prohi- bitive tariffs. I was in considerable doubt how to vote on certain sections in the Bill - namely, in regard to clerks in banks and warehouses - as it is very difficult to get at the truth as to whether these petitions which we have received express the real feeling of the employés, or whether they are coerced by the employers to sign the petitions. I have tried to find out from independent persons who have been em- ployed in banks at one time, but are now out of the bank, and therefore can express their minds freely, and they have told me that the petitions do express the opinions of the employés. But on the other side I have also been told by reli- able persons that the employés need protection. But then comes the question, even if they do express the opinions of the persons interested, why should the banks and warehousemen be left out altogether? Why should they not be treated like any other institution? We must recollect that we have a large interest in a bank that does half the business of the colony, with a body of employés who are practically the officers of the colony. We find the bank the capital to carry on ; we find them four millions and a half ; and therefore to all intents and purposes the bank is a colonial bank, and we are responsible for its actions. The bank officials are our officers, and it is our duty to protect them ; and therefore, balancing the opinions on both sides, I intend to vote for the Bill in regard to bank clerks and ware- houses. I see no reason to make a distinction between the employés in banks and ware- houses and other persons in the community. If any injustice is done by the passing of this Bill we shall hear of it next session. The Bill has been introduced in this Chamber, and has to go to another place to be revised. We initiate these great Bills, and, instead of this being the revising Chamber, in this instance the representatives of the people will have to revise our work, and if we have done an in- justice they will have an opportunity to put it right. I therefore state that I will vote for the Bill as a whole. I see no reason whatever for departing from the general principle. very much astonished to think that one or two new provisions in this Bill should have emptied so many vials of wrath upon my head. After all, we must admit that the Bill has not only passed this Chamber on two previous occasions, but that it is absolutely the law as it stands at the present time, with one or two exceptions. The strange thing is this : that the inclusion of these different occupations were inserted in the Bill by the operation of our own Labour Bills Committee. Members of that Committee will know that the original Bill did not include some of these provisions. For instance, it did not include the provision as to overtime. That was inserted by the Labour Bills Committee last year. An Hon. MEMBER .- How many were at the meeting ? The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- I do not remember, but there were enough to show an intelligent interest in the Bill. Then, in the same way, this Bill is the same Bill that was brought down two years ago, only with certain suggestions accepted from our own Labour Bills Committee. Of course, honourable gentlemen may endeavour to throw out those suggestions, but they must admit that the Labour Bills Committee takes a very painstaking and intel- ligent interest in all these questions. They have done a great deal to claim not only re- spect at the hands of the Council for the work they have done in the past, but they have also won the esteem of the public at large, because I find that the public at large is more inclined to lay a case, or any hardship in proposed legisla- tion, before the Labour Bills Committee of this Chamber than they are to lay it before the Labour Bills Committee of another place. And that is accounted for by the care and the time the Labour Bills Committee of this Chamber devote to a subject. I do not think it is right, therefore, to endeavour to minimise the work that that Committee does, or to say that because they have inserted a clause in the Bill that has been before them that clause should not be carefully considered and approached with a certain amount of re- spect. That is all I wish to contend for. I wish to point out that when this Bill was first before us two years ago it did not contain some of the clauses that are now most strongly ob- jected to. I must say, too, it is very refresh- ing to hear an old warhorse on the warpath again. It was pleasing to notice that the Hon. Mr. McLean, when he gets the chance, can still take his preliminary canter and bring out the old stock arguments against any kind of labour legislation. Sir, it did us all good, and we are glad to know that he is able still to think that there is either sound or sense in the old stock argument which he has used so often. Of course, he has been encouraged to a certain extent, because he finds certain clauses in this Bill to which there is a certain amount of opposition ; but he must not delude himself into believing that the Council as a whole is going to stultify all its legislation of the past ten years, or into thinking that 
<page:458>
of legislation there is nothing good in it. We are older than we were ten years ago, and we have learned by experience, and, in spite of what the honourable gentleman may say, not only have we been justified in the legislation we have passed during the last few years on these subjects, but events have abso- lutely proved how right we have been, and how very wrong the prophets of evil were when they protested against those measures. It is too late now for any honourable gentleman to get up in his place and say, simply because he does not like a measure or because a measure embodies some new thing, that therefore it necessarily is wrong. That is no argument at all ; it never was any argument at all ; but now that sort of argument has been discredited, and the prophecies we have heard so often have proved to be false, and things have turned out just in the opposite way to which the prophets desired. I do not think, therefore, that this Council need care twopence for opinions of that kind. Of course, I listened with great respect to the personal opinions of honourable members as to including this class and that class and the other class of traders in this Bill. I know that members in this Council have had many more experiences in certain directions than I have had myself, and my endeavour always is to learn from them where my experience falls short. But to my mind the only argument that I have heard in reference to bank clerks, for instance, that is worth anything at all was the argument used by the Hon. Mr. Pinkerton, in which, speaking as an old trades-unionist, he said that it was of no use helping people who would not help themselves. Well, I must say in the bottom of my heart I have a certain sympathy with that sentiment. If bank clerks are as subservient as I believe they must be to have signed those petitions, I believe they hardly deserve help. But, Sir, in spite of their subservience, in spite of the way they will follow the guidance of the hand that should cherish, but which in some cases crushes cruelly, I think we ought not to take them out of this Bill. We ought to give them the protection which the law ought to give to any child of the State. In the same way, I think, in their own interests it would be better both for employers and employed that over- time should be treated as an amount of work to be paid for, as out of ordinary time. I am sure it would bring about more satisfactory relations between employers and employed. As to all we have heard about the amicable relations existing between the institutions and their employés, if all that is true I am quite sure the payment of overtime will not disturb them. I am not troubling myself with their affairs; but, if they have not the spirit to let us know what their feelings are, I do not think there should be very much doubt that those institutions have worked their clerks a good deal longer hours and paid them excessively small salaries. The privileges they get in the matter of holidays and sick-pay are what any employer must give to his servants Hon. Mr. W. C. Walker luxuries-they are necessities, and we all know very well that bankers give them to their employés in order that they may be kept fresh  for their work, and I am quite sure that holi- days will not be taken from the bank clerks as a result of the passing of this measure; nor do I think their pay will be reduced, because this cannot be done below a certain point. A man must have enough to live decently on, and their present salaries can admit of no deduction. I trust the Council will go into Committee on this Bill, and there give careful consideration to the clauses that have been inserted since it was first brought down two years ago. I hope they will do this, and turn out as good a Bill as they possibly can. It was with regret that I heard the remarks from some honourable gentlemen to the effect that it is a wrong departure to initiate measures of this kind in this Chamber. I would point out that this is largely and principally a con- solidating measure, which the Council, on its. own motion, has added to. Since I have had the honour of representing the Govern- ment in this Chamber, my endeavour nas always been to give the Council work to do; but if I am not to initiate measures. excepting those of merely a formal or not contentious kind, then I say that this Chamber would be more often without work than it is at present. I do not see how any objection can be brought against this Bill, because it is really a consolidating measure, and one that requires. careful consideration. I therefore think that the Council should now proceed with the Bill in Committee, and judge it by the evidence taken by the Committee and the report that has been brought down. I move, Sir, That you do now leave the chair, in order that the Council may go into Committee on this Bill. Bill committed, and progress reported.

Mr. McNAB (Mataura) .- Sir, in moving that the report of the Committee be agreed to. I desire to point out to honourable members and 
<page:459>
which have been made by the Committee. I will in the first place deal with the amendment in clause 3. It is an altogether unimportant amendment. Honourable members will re- member that when a debate took place on the second reading a question was raised by the member for Auckland City (Mr. Napier) re- garding three words contained in that clause, which he asked should be deleted from the Bill, and, as the words were quite unnecessary, specifying that the legislation was to con- tinue "for all time," I agreed to the striking out of the words when the Bill was before the Committee, and accordingly these three words have now been struck out. They were entirely unnecessary in the first instance, and the meaning of the clause has not been affected by their striking out. The important amend- ment made by the Committee-in fact, the only other amendment that has been made by the Committee-is the striking out of the schedule, and I want to explain to honourable members the position in regard to that amend- ment. When the legislation was first proposed by the two Churches regarding their union, it took the form of an agreement entered into between the two Churches, specifying the terms on which they proposed to join, and this agree- ment was handed over to some legal gentleman to prepare a Bill to give effect to the terms of the agreement. When the Bill came into my hands, after having been agreed to by the two Churches, I pointed out certain objections which this House would have to legislation in the form in which they had handed the Bill over to me, and my objections were deemed worthy of such consideration that a special meeting of the Synod of the southern Church was called to consider them. I might say that the ob- jections consisted of this: that the lawyers, when preparing the Bill to give effect to the articles of agreement of the two Churches, had practically gone so far as to constitute the two Churches a united Church by statute law, and to enact the terms of union of the two Churches by statute, a thing that was never contemplated by either Church in the first in- stance, but which they had allowed to pass through the Courts of the Church, not having any other outside advice or the terms of the Bill that was to give effect to their union. In fact, they took the Bill as a patient will take a pre- scription he gets from his medical man-with- out any question at all. When this point was brought before the knowledge of the Synod another meeting was held ; but previous to that meeting being held I had a conference with the Committee dealing with the Bill, and it was arranged that all the clauses in the original Bill that dealt with ecclesiastical and spiritual mat- ters should be eliminated from the Bill, and the Bill only deal with the question of Church property, just as the union of other Churches which has gone through this House only re- quired legislation to deal with their property. When we were striking out of the original Bill the clauses that were unnecessary we struck out a clause which I will read :- Presbyterian Church of Otago and Southland and the Presbyterian Church of New Zealand shall be held to be united as one Church, spiritually and ecclesiastically, under the name of the 'Presbyterian Church of New Zealand," subject to this Act and the terms and pro. visions set forth in the Schedule to this Act." This clause was entirely removed from the original Bill, but we did not remove from the original Bill the Schedule the clause referred to; and there was a Schedule. Amongst the recitals there was the following :- " Whereas the said Churches, by an agree- ment signed by the Moderator of the said Synod and the Moderator of the said General Assembly, have agreed to the terms of the said union, and such agreement is set forth in the Schedule to this Act." And the reference in the recital to the Schedule of the Bill itself, we retained, although perhaps it ought to have gone, out of the Bill along with the 2nd clause. The Bill was then referred to the Churches, and the southern Church agreed to the amendments which had been made. But this included the retention of the Schedule, which, with another point which had arisen, was, I understand, referred by the Synod to Mr. T. F. Macdonald, of Invercargill, to advise whether the clauses should be re- tained or not. One of the clauses which was re- ferred to, and which we decided should be in the Bill, was struck out by the Synod with his Then the Bill came up to the House consent. for consideration. When the northern Church saw that the Schedule was retained in the Bill by the southern Church they approached, through their committee, the southern Church, and requested that the Schedule should now be removed from the Bill, as all reference to ecclesiastical and spiritual matters had been eliminated, and the Bill, they contended, should deal with the articles of agreement of the Churches, just the same as the Methodist Bill, which had been passed through the House in 1895, and there should be no reference to the terms of agreement in the Bill itself. The matter was referred by the southern Church to its legal adviser, who advised them that, so far as the legal effeet of the union was concerned, it did not matter whether the Schedule was retained in the Bill or struck out, as the Schedule con- tained only the agreement between the two Churches. This being the advice of their legal adviser, when the northern Church asked that the Schedule be strues out the southern Church agreed to that amendment, and, when the ques- tion came before the Committee on the Bill, the two Churches were, through their representa- tives, present, and asked that the Schedule should be struck out and the necessary amendments in the recital made, so that it simply specifies in the recital that an agreement has been entered upon on certain terms. Hence the amendment which has been made in the Bill since its second reading, and which honourable members will see on the copy of the Bill submitted. These are the only amendments that have been made, and I do not think there is anything else 
<page:460>
union of the Churches in so far as this: that when the Churches unite, that union will not affect the trusts connected with the property owned by the southern Church. That is all the Bill proposes to accomplish. I move, That the amendments made by the Committee be agreed to by the House. Mr. J. W. THOMSON (Clutha) .- The honour- able member for Mataura has told us how it happens that the Schedule, which forms part of the Bill as introduced. came to be struck out by the Private Bills Committee. I may say I have had a letter from a clergyman in Dun- edin who wishes to see the Bill pass as intro- duced-that is to say, with the Schedule as part of the Bill. I mentioned this to the honour- able member for Mataura, and asked him to delay the Bill for a week, but he did not see his way to agree to my request. I have the right to move that the debate be adjourned, but I am unwilling. to take the responsibility of doing that. The Bill has still to pass the Legislative Council. Those, therefore, who are desirous that the Bill should pass as intro- duced will have an opportunity of placing their view of the case before the other branch of the Legislature. As they have this oppor- tunity, I shall not interfere with the passing of the Bill. Mr. BUDDO (Kaiapoi) .- Like the honour- able member for the Clutha, I also regret that provision is not made to retain the Schedule in the Bill. The Schedule contains the whole  terms of union of the Otago and New Zealand Presbyterian Churches, which, from a Church point of view, it is most desirable to have re- tained. I do not intend to move an adverse   motion, because I recognise that the honour- able member for Mataura is empowered by the bodies interested to act in their interests, but I wish most emphatically to protest against the proposal to eliminate such a valuable record of the union from the Bill. I think the Bill ought to have been altered to suit the Schedule, instead of the Schedule being cut out to suit the Bill, and I trust that this beneficial amalgamation of Churches may be in the direction of giving greater power to such a large body as the Presbyterian Church of New Zealand to work in the interests of that Church in all social work in the community. I have no other objection to make, feeling sure that the honour- able member for Mataura has the confidence of both Churches who are parties to this union. Mr. G. J. SMITH (Christchurch City) .- Sir, I think the honourable member for Mataura has been wise in taking the Schedule out of the Bill. The Presbyterian Churches of New Zealand want legal authority only to deal with their properties, and, so far as Church government is concerned, members of that Church will, I think, find it very much better to eliminate from the Bill all reference to that. When the Methodist Bill was being considered the question was looked at, and it was decided that it should deal with the legal difficulties so far as the property was concerned only, and that any reference to Church government in the Mr. McNab Presbyterian Church will find that the altera- tion agreed to by the honourable member for Mataura will be in the best interests of that Church itself. Personally, I am delighted to find that the two Presbyterian Churches of New Zealand are united, and have become one strong body. Mr. MEREDITH (Ashley) .- When this Bill came from the Committee my suspicions were somewhat aroused on account of the Schedule having been excised from it, but after hearing  the explanation of the honourable member for Mataura, Mr. McNab, who is in charge of the Bill, and who has been in direct communication with its promoters both in Otago and Southland, and also those of the northern Church, I think the House might rest satisfied that everything that need be done has been done in order to serve the best interests of the united organiza- tions. I understand that one of the objects of the Bill is to give a legal status to the united Church as a corporate body to hold property. I do not agree with my honourable friend the member for Clutha, Mr. Thomson, that there is justification for misgivings on the question. I am prepared to support the Bill, believing as I do that it is in the best interests of that import- ant Church organization, which numbers about one-fourth of the total population of the colony, and hope the union will be productive of the highest good. Mr. T. MACKENZIE (Waihemo). - The honourable member for Christchurch City (Mr. Smith), says that this Bill is what the Presby- terian Church of New Zealand requires, and he has arrived at that conclusion on account of certain conditions that obtained in the Bill 1 of another Church of this colony some years ago. I have, however, had communications stating that the concessions granted by the honourable member for Mataura were never contemplated by the supreme Court of the Presbyterian Church of Otago, and that the whole union was influenced and promoted by the retention of the Schedule of the Bill. Some of the oldest and most respected ministers of the Presbyterian Church of Otago declare that if the Schedule is not made part of the Bill it will cause very great trouble to the Church in Otago. I have had very strong letters upon the point, and I am requested to oppose the Bill, because without the inclusion of the Schedule they maintain its purposes are lost. They declare their surprise that the repre- sentatives of the Church from the South should, in order to obtain unanimity, have conceded points that were never contemplated by the Presbyterian Church of Otago when the union was agreed upon. I am simply voicing the opinion of these worthy clergymen, and not my own. The subject is one that I am not suffi- ciently familiar with to give an opinion of my own upon it ; but the gentlemen I refer to are perhaps the most representative of the Church in Otago, and I venture to think that their opinion should receive great consideration here. The honourable member for Clutha says that he does not feel justified in moving the adjourn- 
<page:461>
further opportunity in the Legislative Council of doing what he would wish the honourable member in charge of the Bill to do now. The .union is a most important one, and I venture 'to think that the people of the colony feel very deep gratification at it, because they recognise that the Church when united, as we hope to see it, may be able to make itself felt more in this colony in certain directions than it is able to do at present. Its numbers are many, and its influence proportionate in the legislative coun- sels of the colony, but is not as great as it should be in connection with some educational measures which are near and dear to that Church. I feel that I am not at all justified in taking any steps on my own responsibility in delaying the passing of this Bill ; but I express the hope that the honourable gentleman in charge of the Bill will vet see his way to retain what, at any rate, some of the best members of that Church recognise as the very leading principle of the Bill. If this is struck out, they state that they will then be deprived of what they hold to be the best feature in connection with the whole measure, and a declaration of the actual condition under which the southern Church agreed to unite with the north. In view of that it is of the utmost necessity the retaining of the Schedule. They will feel that that has been taken away from them which they would not for any consideration have so taken away. I am making a statement that is based upon information that I have received from corre-  spondence. As I said a moment ago, I am not giving my own opinion, but an opinion that has been conveyed to me, and I claim that these opinions ought to have the respect of the House, considering the source from which they emanate, and that therefore we should strike out this clause, as I have indicated. Mr. McNAB (Mataura) .- There are just one or two points I should like to reply upon. First of all, with regard to the statement of the honourable member for Ashley. He was en- tirely in error in saying that this Bill gives legal effect to the union of the Church, and forms them into a body corporate. I was not clear in moving the adoption of this report in explaining that the union of the Churches is effected without any legislation at all, but simply by agreement between the two Churches, which agreement has been prepared and signed by the Churches. But there was this difficulty, which I explained on the second reading : that the southern Church possessed a considerable amount of property in Otago, which is held subject to trusts, that require a body connected with the Presbyterian Church to exist in Otago to distribute these funds in Otago only. To enable the southern Church to unite and at the same time to carry out these trusts this Bill was required ; but it was not required to effect any union whatever, and in the articles of the union only those articles are to be incorporated in the Bill that deal with the further retention of these trusts that I have referred to. Now, in connection with the remarks of the last honourable gentleman who spoke, I think it name of his correspondent, because I believe that if that had been done a different weight might have been given to the remarks which he narrated- they were not his own -- as coming from the Presbyterian Church of Otago. With- out saying that the amanuensis was the same as the writer of the letter to the honourable member for the Clutha, and without identifying either of them as being the one that I mention. I can say this : that the great opponent of union in every shape and form in the southern Pres- byterian Church of this colony has been the Rev. Dr. Bannerman, and that reverend gentle- man, I am advised, lives in the borough of which the honourable gentleman is the worthy Mayor. I respect the reverend gentleman for the way that he has, in season and out of season, fought conscientiously against union in any shape or form. I may say this-I do not suggest it as the reason for urging opposi- tion to this Bill in the House, but it is a peculiar thing that the importance of this Schedule is now brought forward. So far as the legal effect is concerned, it does not matter whether the Schedule is in or out, but the northern Church at the last moment wanted that Schedule retained. It was a matter of grave doubt with the southern Church whe- ther the union would be effected at all if that Schedule were kept in the Bill : and there is this strange thing that I might refer to : that just at that psychological moment the leader of the opposition to the union - Dr. Bannerman - should find the importance of keeping the Schedule in the Bill, although the result of keeping it in the Bill would be to prevent the union. It was very unfortunate that a re- verend gentleman who was interested should himself have communicated with anybody at all in this House. I move, Sir, That the re- port be agreed to. Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- I have just one re- mark to make Mr. SPEAKER .- On a matter of personal explanation, I presume. Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- Yes, Sir. In justifi- cation of that grand old monument in Otago, Dr. Bannerman-would there were a great many more of his type in the colony, for he does not give way to every breath of popular opinion -- I wish to say that neither directly nor indirectly had I any communication whatever with that gentleman. So you see the objection to the deletion of the Schedule is much wider spread than was suspected by the mover of the Bill. Motion agreed to, and Bill read a third time. CHARITABLE GIFTS BILL. Mr. CARROLL (Native Minister) .- Sir, I do not propose to take up much of the time of the House in introducing this measure, which is called into necessity through the gift by Dr. Logan Campbell the other day to the people of this colony. He gifted to the public 230 acres of very valuable land within the surroundings of Auckland ; but on going into the matter it was found that the deed conveying the said 
<page:462>
ment and it, therefore, was subject to the taxa- tion imposed by the Stamp Act. Now, I think every one will agree with me that any gift of that nature given to the public, or to a public institution for the benefit of the public, should come within the province of statutory exemp- tions-that is, all similar gifts in the future. It will be seen, however, that this Bill does not cover the particular transaction referred to. The reason of that is, though we provide to free all such cases in the future, we consider it un- desirable to have retrospective legislation. We can place a sum of money on the estimates sufficient to cover the amount of stamp duty required under the Act, and in that way free this gift from the burden imposed. The trans- action of Dr. Campbell's gift is one that comes within the spirit although not within the strict letter of the law providing for ex- emptions, and, to set that point clear in re- spect to all future transactions of the kind, this Bill is absolutely necessary. I may add that we cannot view the act of Dr. Logan Campbell in too high a light as a public dona- tion. It was really a magnificent deed. He is a gentleman of very high standing in the colony and long associated with its history, and this is only one of many noble works he has performed on behalf of the people. It is one of those instances where individual merit is -crowned by acts which enable the many to reap to universal advantage. I am sure the House will be making a very graceful acknow- ledgment to those who are benefactors to man- kind by passing this Bill. Mr. MONK (Waitemata) .- I hope the House will generously make a retrospective exception in the case mentioned by the Minister intro- ducing the Bill. I will not say anything about retrospective legislation in the past, because I think this is a matter in which no party feeling can possibly intrude. The gift of Cornwall Park you may describe as a gift to the people of New Zealand. I cannot consider it as a gift especially to Auckland, although, of course, you cannot remove that gift of land from the pre- cinets of Auckland. Yet it is given to every inhabitant of New Zealand who chooses to visit that spot. It is an historic piece of ground, rich in Maori lore, and while I say I would not refer to any instance of retrospective legislation on the part of the Government as a precedent for what I am asking, because to do that would be to touch a note inharmonious to the spirit prompting the gift mentioned by the Minister in introducing this Bill, but when the Bill is in Committee I hope the House will generously give it a place amongst the retrospective privi- leges that Parliament can confer. I do not think the matter wants any further remark from me. The House must sympathize with the purpose of this Bill. We have several instances of gifts made by individuals-I do not think merely through the incidence of their death, but pur- posels and in charitable intent they have con- trived during their life accumulations for the pur- pose of benefiting the people of New Zealand after their death-and perhaps in nearly all in- charge of the Bill he did not explain the dis- Mr. Carroll disposed. not because the incidence or approach of death has made them indifferent to the value of personal possession or wealth, but from a con- trived purpose that they should confer benefits on the generations who live after them. Those are matters that we should have a pride and pleasure in supporting, and in doing such things as will encourage their continuation. I do not think, Sir, that the wealthy can in any way do better and perform nobler deeds for mankind than in leaving great bequests for the purpose of founding and fostering those institutions that will confer great benefits in elevating the social and national life of future genera- tions. It is unnecessary to allude to the munificent gifts made by Mr. Carnegie. Per- haps there are many of us who may have dii- ferences of opinion as to some of the methods by which his great wealth was accumulated, but I am sure there is no one. Sir, but will feel gratified that the millionaire is making such munificent gifts, and we hope that those gifts themselves will help to bring about the enlightenment that will lead towards the correction of those evils the existence of which we consider have enabled him to accumu- late the enormous wealth he possesses. I am socialist myself enough to believe that the time will come when communities and nations, in defence of the public interest and the public weal-indeed, of social freedom-will make regulations dealing with the enormous wealth that some persons are possessed of in this age - seemingly in many instances through little effort or skill of their own. I believe the time will come when the amount which at death such people may confer upon each child or relative will be limited, and that the remainder shall be diverted to the benefit of the commonwealth in the creation of edu- cational and eleemosynary endowments. It seems to me, Sir. that it is necessary that some control of the dead hand shall be assumed by the people, in order to neutralise the danger, owing to the enormous accumulations that some men become possessed of. I think it possible that a man possessed of thirty or forty millions-increasing and accumulating by the operations of compound interest through suc- cessive generations -- may become a menace to individual liberty in the community to which he belongs. I hope the House will adopt my suggestion, and will agree to pass retrospec- tive legislation applying to the Cornwall Park gift. It may have been modesty on the part of the honourable gentleman introducing this Bill that he does not propose to make it retrospec- tive; but he may be thinking that the House, in its native generosity, would itself introduce a clause making it retrospective, in appreciation of Dr. Campbell's gift. I hope it will be an incentive to other gentlemen possessed of ample means to make, in other parts of the colony, bequests for the welfare and pleasure of the public. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton). - I regret that in the speech made by the Minister in 
<page:463>
which is being repealed by this Bill and the proposals of the Bill now before the House. Under the Charitable Gifts Duties Exemption Act of 1883, which is now being repealed, a very wide definition was given of the term "chari- table bequests." The 2nd clause of that Act says,- "The term 'charitable bequests' includes devises, bequests, and legacies of real or per- sonal property respectively of whatever descrip- tion to public institutions such as libraries, museums, institutions for the promotion of science and art, colleges and schools, or to hos- pitals, orphan, lunatic, or benevolent asylums, dispensaries." And then the 3rd clause goes on to say that there shall be no duty levied upon any bequest that may be made in connection with any of those institutions. Now, it appears to me that this Bill in one respect has a tendency to limit the operation of the exemption, and in another respect it appears to widen it. Looking at the definition of " public institution," it appears to me that one of the primary objects of this clause is to extend this exemption of duties to Churches. That appears to be a very large part of the pro- posal. It is very difficult indeed to know how tar ecclesiastical institutions are "irrespective of class or creed," and that appears to be an important element in the definition of " public institution " under this clause. As I have said, I do not propose to review the whole of the proposals of the Bill. But what I fail  to see is what the distinction is between the law as it exists in the Act of 1883 and the pro- posals in the Bill now before the House. It may be quite correct, as stated by the Minister in charge of the Bill, that the underlying object of the Bill is to relieve such bequests as that made by Dr. Campbell, of Auckland-a very noble bequest, and one which will be to his eternal credit, and a gift which everybody in the colony must recognise as being a very valuable and noble one. Nobody would wish to see a bequest of that kind brought under the operation of the duties which are in existence ; but I think the Minister ought to explain what the essential difference is between the provi sions of the Act of 1883 and this Bill. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) .- Sir, I do not think I would have found it necessary on this occasion to say anything if I had not been requested by the senior member for Auckland City (Mr. Napier)-who is unfortunately suffer- ing from a severe cold, and on that account unable to speak -to voice for him the gratitude of the citizens of Auckland for the noble and munificent gift which has lately been handed over to them by ex-Mayor Dr. Campbell, and I accordingly do. so. Sir, Auckland has been particularly fortunate in the matter of public benefactors. At this moment quite a long list of names occurs to me. I can think of Costley, Dilworth, McKelvie, Elam, Arrowsmith, Grey, and now last, and perhaps greatest of all, Dr. Campbell, who has, as the crowning act of a long life, handed over to the citizens of Auck- land, for themselves and their descendants, wall Park. The names of these men will go down in history as philanthropists in the best and truest sense of the word. Sir, there can be no possible objection to the principle of the Bill, whatever Committee objections there may be, and I congratulate the Government heartily on its introduction. Mr. LAWRY (Parnell) .- Sir, the honourable member for Riccarton fell into what may per- haps be considered a natural error under the circumstances of the case, and my 'friend the member for Franklin did the same. I would like to point out to the House and to the country that, whilst this munificent bequest of Dr. Campbell's is primarily for the Auckland citizens, not for Auckland City, it is a gift that is given to the whole colony. It is a recreation-ground for any person who visits Auckland, as it is virtually held in trust for the whole world. I do not see that there can be any possible objec- tion to a Bill of this nature. It appears to me the House should pass it not only unanimously, but with acclamation, because if ever there was a meritorious measure brought before this House it is the Bill I hold in my hand at the present time. I entirely indorse the remarks of the honourable member for Franklin when he said that this munificent gift from Dr. Camp- bell was the crowning act of a glorious public life. The man's whole life has been characterized by charity. For myself, I do not believe in spurious titles. I believe in democracy pure and simple, under circumstances as they now exist, but I trust that when the coronation honours are distributed the reward of merit will be conferred on Dr. Campbell, and that we shall then no longer know him as Dr. Campbell, but as Sir John Logan Campbell. An Hon. MEMBER .- It would not do him any good. Mr. LAWRY .- No, it would not do him any good, but it would be a recognition of the man's great worth, as great merit is rewarded at the present time. Sir, it has been my pleasure and my privilege to have known Dr. Campbell during the whole period of my colonial life. I have been associated with him in business, and have been in his confidence on many occasions, and I know what he has done without ostentation in the matter of private charity as well as public charity, and I repeat that the whole course of his life has been characterized by charity and by benevolence of the very highest order -- his whole life has been characterized by systematic beneficence. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) .- Sir, I would like to say a word with reference to the point that has been raised by the member for Riccarton. The honourable mem- ber asked whether the provisions contained in this Bill are likely to interfere with those of the statute he quoted from. Mr. PIRANI .- That statute is repealed by this Bill. Sir J. G. WARD .- Well, I think that in all cases of munificent gifts such as this, provision should be made to insure that they should be exempt from stamp duty, and that, I consider, 
<page:464>
might be done without interfering with the provisions of the other Act. For instance, there is no reason why the amount of stamp duty which under ordinary circumstances would be paid in connection with this gift should not be placed on the estimates in the first instance and returned in the ordinary way. But, that there should be provision made of such a character as to insure that in all cases in future stamp duty should not be leviable, I think the House will agree. I desire, as a member of the House, to add my tribute to the praise the honourable member for Franklin bestowed upon the many citizens who have done so much to add to the prestige of the northern city of Auckland, and I wish that other towns in the colony had philanthropists who would act similarly. I should like, in connection with the gentleman to whom such eulogistic reference has been made, to say that there is no man in the country who deserved better recognition as an old and valued citizen, and by the munificence of his gift which he has conferred upon the colony ; because, although Auckland itself is the more immediate bene- ficiary, the colony as a whole derives incalcul- able benefit by such generous acts. It would be, I am sure, to the universal satisfaction of the people throughout the length and breadth of the colony if the services of Dr. Campbell were recognised in a way which would add to the lustre of his name, and which, so long as Auck- land exists, will live in the memory of its people. It would afford immense pleasure to the  citizens of Auckland, as it would to the colony as a whole. Mr. MEREDITH (Ashley) .- I cordially agree with the principle of the Bill. Every en- couragement ought to be given to benevolent and public-spirited persons who are in the possession of wealth to set it apart for the country's good, and all that has been said by the honourable gentleman who has just sat down and the member for Franklin I cordially agree with. One point raised by the member for Riccarton is worthy the attention of the honourable gentleman in charge of the Bill, and that is that the term "public institution " it appears to me is not sufficiently defined. think the clause should be amended by adding, after "educational purpose," "duly elected as a governing body." If public bodies having control of endowments were duly elected and in touch with the people, it would be a guarantee that the intention of the bequest would be car- ried into effect. I have only to remind the House that endowments in other countries-for example, Italy-immediately after the war of unification, in which the celebrated Gene- ral Garibaldi figured so conspicuously, the endowments in connection with religious insti- tutions were taken away to the extent of more than six millions and devoted to the benefit of the State under public control ; and just recently a Bill has passed the French Parliament disen- dowing certain institutions, and devoting their revenues and endowments to distinctly public purposes. I think the honourable gentleman in charge would be wise to remove all suspicion Sir J. G. Ward or doubt respecting the Bill by moving in the direction indicated. I hope the House will endeavour to bear in mind the point raised by the member for Riccarton, and which I have endeavoured to emphasize a little further. It is quite true that Auckland has reaped a rich harvest from public-spirited men who came in the early days to reside in that part of the. colony, and who have acquired wealth as the result of industry, application, and foresight. But public-spirited men are not confined to Auckland. We have had them in Canterbury, and Canterbury people are considerably in- debted to persons whose names I could mention -honourable names of those who have endeared themselves to the people on account of their public-spirited acts in placing property at the disposal of public bodies for the benefit of the- public. Mr. MILLS (Minister of Trade and Cus- toms) .- I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without testifying what I think of the generous and noble-hearted man who has given such a valuable gift to the residents of Auckland and the Colony of New Zealand. I think strangers are particularly impressed on visiting Auckland with what has been done for the place by so many other public-spirited men, because it is so much more than has been done in other parts of the colony ; and I am inclined to envy the town which has had that class of men residing there so long, and who have left such valuable records behind them for the benefit of posterity. 1 happened to be in Auckland when the gift was made, and was present when the key of that grand park was handed over, and I really felt that nothing could be more patriotic than the way in which that large area of land was dedicated to the public by that venerable old pioneer, Dr. Campbell. I am sure that he has the thanks of the whole of the people of New Zealand for his noble gift. I know that there have been men in other parts of the colony who have done their share in making dedications for the benefit of posterity. In my own electorate the late Mr. Carter conveved a piece of land to the governors, and handed it over to them for a new high school, and I have no doubt this measure will be the means of I inducing others to follow the good example set by Dr. Campbell and other generous old settlers with protit to the people of the colony. I have much pleasure in supporting the Bill. Mr. BOLLARD (Eden) .-- I should like to say a few words before this Bill goes to its second reading. I feel, as an Auckland man. very much disappointed that this Bill does not refer especially to the Cornwall Park; but I have the assurance of the Minister that a sum would be placed on the estimates for the pur- pose of recouping the amount of duty paid in connection with the transference of that pro- perty. But this Bill is not such a simple measure as it appears at first sight. It is a Bill brought in for the express purpose of securing to the Government certain duties that may be paid and have to be paid in future. It is not so long ago since another Auckland gentleman made a large bequest to the people, 
<page:465>
comprising the whole of the Dilworth Estate. Then the Government put the trustees to a great deal of trouble and expense. They had to find some $25,000 in connection with that estate as duty; but the trustees appealed to the Privy Council, and the Government has to refund the money. Now, this Bill is evi- dently brought in for the express purpose of enabling the Government to evade a re- fund of the duty in similar cases, because I notice here the words "irrespective of class or creed " have been inserted. I see no good reason why the Cornwall Park should not have been expressly referred to in the Bill. It is a noble gift given by an old colonist to the people of New Zealand, and more especially to the people of Auckland. Its present value is about #100,000, and probably in fifty or, say, a hundred years it will be the centre of a large city, and be a property of enormous value. I can see no good reason why the Go- vernment should not have provided for a remission of the duty in this little Bill. With regard to the remark made by the Minister as to the necessity for special legislation, I do not see what difference it would make if this particular property was specially mentioned here. The evident intention of the Bill is to prevent parties in the future from compelling the Government to refund certain duties, as happened in the Dilworth case. I think it would be very much safer for the trustees in the Cornwall Estate to have this Bill made to specially apply to that gift. If the duty has to be paid in the first instance, and then to be re- funded, the trustees will have to get the money to do this from some outside source, for they have no revenue available for the purpose. It would be much better if the Bill were amended in Committee so as to include Cornwall Park amongst the exemptions from duty. I hope the Minister will see his way to do this. Mr. CARROLL (Native Minister) .- I regret that the honourable gentleman who last spoke should have been rather sceptical as to the in- tentions of the Government with regard to this Bill. I can assure him that it is not the inten- tion of the Government to exempt itself from any of its liabilities. As to the proposal to make this Bill refer specially to the Cornwall Park gift, all that I can say is that the Com- mittee can settle that point itself. On the broad ground I consider it is not desirable to have retrospective legislation, especially in mat- ters of this kind ; but if the Committee insist on any special clause being put into the Bill to deal with the Cornwall Park gift I should not oppose it. But I think the other course- namely, that a sum of money be placed on the estimates to cover the amount of the stamp duty, is preferable. As to the point raised by the member for Riccarton, I can assure him that this Bill does not in any way restrict the range of the main Act. Mr. PIRANI .- But it does that of the 1883 Act. Mr. CARROLL .- But clause 2 of the main Act, with a clearer interpretation, is brought forward in this Bill. VOL. CXVII .- 29. Mr. PIRANI .- But in one way only. Mr. CARROLL .- It has been declared by our Supreme Court Judges that the present Act is unworkable so far as clause 2 is concerned ; this Bill is to make it workable. Take the case of the Dilworth Estate, referred to by the honour- able member for Eden. All the Judges of the Supreme Court said that we could claim duty on that bequest, but the Privy Council said we could not, and decided against us. Now, wedo not want the law to be so uncertain ; we want it to be clear and beyond doubt. This Bill pro- poses to remove all such doubts, and it is very desirable that this should be done to prevent complications in the future. However, a good deal can be cleared up in a Bill like this when it gets into Committee. I can add very little to what has already been said by honourable gentlemen in their remarks with regard to the munificent and noble act of Dr. Campbell. I can only say that any country would be rich indeed if it had in its possession men of his high character and generous instincts. Bill read a second time. # HOSPITAL NURSES REGISTRATION BILL. On the question That this Bill be committed, Mr. SPEAKER drew attention to two clauses -4 and 7-of the Bill that were read on the pre- vious evening. These clauses were underlined by the Legislative Council to show that they formed no part of the Bill, as they imposed fees and fines which it was not within their power to put in the Bill. Following the precedent esta- blished in 1898, he (Mr. Speaker) suggested that these clauses, which involved the payment of fees and penalties, should be approved by Com- mittee of the Whole before being submitted to the Committee on the Bill. Clauses 4 and 7 of the Bill referred to Con- mitte of the Whole, and approved. Money clauses reported, and Bill, with clauses approved, referred to Committee on the Bill. # IN COMMITTEE. Clause 2. - Interpretation. Mr. HALL -JONES (Minister for Public Works) moved to insert, at the end of the defi- nition of "hospital," the words " and includes such other hospitals, the proprietors of which consent to such hospitals being open to inspec- tion under 'The Hospitals and Charitable Institutions Act, 1885,' as may be approved by the Governor in Council." Mr. PIRANI moved to report progress. Motion to report progress negatived. Amendment agreed to, and clause as amended agreed to. Clause 4 .- "(1.) Every person who, on the first day of January, one thousand nine hundred and two, holds a certificate of three consecutive years' training as a nurse in a hospital, and proves that during her training she received systematic instruction in theoretical and prac- tical nursing from the medical officer and matron (the matron herself being a certificated nurse), is entitled to registration on payment of a fee of ten shillings, and on application to the 
<page:466>
June, one thousand nine hundred and two. "(2.) Every person who, on the passing of this Act, has had four consecutive years' train- ing as a nurse in a hospital, and passes an examination in theoretical and practical nurs- ing by examiners appointed by the Governor under this Act, is entitled to registration on payment of a fee of one pound towards the cost of examination. "(3.) From and after the first day of January, one thousand nine hundred and two, every person who has attained the age of twenty- three years, and is certified as having had three years' training as a nurse in a hospital, to- gether with systematic instruction in theo- retical and practical nursing from the medical officer and the matron of that hospital (the matron herself being a certificated nurse), and who passes an examination from time to time held by examiners appointed under this Act, is entitled to registration on payment of a fee of one pound. "(4.) Every person is entitled to registration, on payment of a fee of one pound, who holds a certificate from the medical officer or autho- rities of any hospital out of New Zealand recognised by the Minister under any regula- tions under this Act, if equivalent in training and examination to what is required from New Zealand nurses under this Act.' Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) moved the following amendment : Omit "first day of January, one thousand nine hundred and two," and substitute "on the  passing of this Act holds a certificate of train- ing from the Auckland, Wellington, Christ- church, or Dunedin Hospital, and every person who then." Amendment to omit the words agreed to. Mr. R. MCKENZIE (Motueka) moved to re- port progress. Mr. HALL-JONES, by leave, moved to in- sert, in place of his former amendment, " on the coming into operation of this Act." Motion to report progress withdrawn. Amendment agreed to. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston) moved to insert, after "proves," "to the satisfaction of the Registrar." Amendment agreed to. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) moved to in- sert, after " received," the words " in a public or private hospital." The Committee divided. AYES, 9. Atkinson Mckenzie, R. Tellers. I'raser, A. L. D.

Mr. HALL - JONES moved, That the word "twenty-five " be struck out, with a view to sub- stituting the word "twelve." Mr. HUTCHESON (Wellington City) moved to report progress. Progress reported, and leave given to sit again. # FINANCIAL STATEMENT. [ For all Tables and Returns referred to in the State- ment, see Appendix, B .- 6.] The House having resolved itself into Com- mittee of Supply, Mr. SEDDON (Colonial Treasurer) said,- Mr. Guinness, - The people, and especially honourable members, are naturally anxious at any time to have the Financial Statement, and this, my sixth Budget, is, owing to various causes, awaited with more than passing in- terest. In this, as in other preceding State- ments, I will without reservation endeavour to place the finances of the colony before members in such a way that all may understand the National Account. The revenue received last year exceeded my most sanguine expectations. Notwithstanding the remissions granted in Customs duties, rail- way freights, passenger-fares, and the reduction in postal rates by giving the penny postage, there was a pleasant surprise in store, for, after meeting all current obligations, there was a balance on the credit side amounting to £532,564. The pessimistic criticism of our finance during the last few weeks has almost verged upon the ludicrous, and thereby a feeling has been raised in the public mind that additional. taxation was imperative. The financial hotch- potch created by some of the critics in mixing the ordinary revenue with the loan account proves gross ignorance, and the necessity for a better education in respect to public finance ; whilst the great ingenuity and industry dis- played in endeavouring to prove that this year the balance must be on the wrong side of the ledger may be appreciated by the few who desired such a contingency. I am glad to say that the few must be disappointed and the many pleased, for it is certain that the revenue this year more than meets the expenditure, and that there will be no deficit. It has been stated in several newspapers that it is proposed to meet the estimated deficiency in part by an additional land-tax, and also by some slight rearrangement of the Customs. It was further alleged that some stringency has occurred in the finances through the claims for old-age pensions being much more numerous than was anticipated, and our detractors have even gone the length of cabling this nonsense to the London journals. The credence given to the imagination of the penny-a-liner should not be found fault with by me, for, with a patriotism that does them infinite credit - which as Colonial Treasurer I very much ap- preciate-merchants have risen to the occasion, cleared kerosene, sugar, and tea, with the result that the Customs revenue this month is buoyant in the extreme, and contrasts very favourably with the same month of last year. The only possible foundation that could give rise to what appeared in certain papers was a statement made by me warning a deputation of members and other gentlemen against pressing for an excessive public works expenditure, thereby entailing borrowing and squandering. Incidentally I stated that the revenue returns, as furnished by the departments, did not warrant the suggested expenditure, and that this caused me some anxiety. Again, in respect to the increase of the graduated land-tax, I stated in the House some weeks ago that, if the Government was to keep the pledge given last year in granting the reduction of {d. in the pound on the mort- gage-tax, the graduated tax on land would re- quire to be increased so as to yield an amount equal to that conceded by way of reduced mortgage-tax ; and, after carefully reviewing the position, I now find that the views ex- pressed have been verified, for a reduction in revenue to the extent of $25,000 could not pru- dently be granted unless otherwise recouped. The announcement that revenue cannot be given away without a necessary recoupment will very naturally and properly lead to the conclusion that revenue and expenditure are fairly evenly balanced. This conclusion is cor- rect ; but it is owing to the inclusion of nearly £120,000 of abnormal and non-recurring expen- diture this year, and to the increase in the Education and Technical Education votes, which are in excess of those of last year by no less than £67,000; also, to an increase in the vote for the Colonial Secretary's Department, which exceeds the vote of last year by £69,300, caused by extraordinary services. The vote for Defence, including the capitation payable to our Volunteers, is also largely increased, owing to the number of Volunteer corps being more than doubled. Even with these exceptional demands upon our resources there will be suffi- cient to meet every requirement, and, at the risk of disappointing the pessimistic alarmists, I am able to announce that there will be no deficit, but a reasonable surplus. It is well, however, that I should, in respect to the expenditure, urge the absolute necessity for prudence and economy, for, although the revenue is buoyant and increasing, yet, owing to reductions in the Customs tariff, the conces- sion of penny postage, remissions in railway charges, and other concessions, there is this year, as compared with last year, a decrease of only £9,500 ; correspondingly there should be a jealously guarded expenditure, for a restricted population can only bear a limited and reason- able impost of taxation. Luckily for this colony all our eggs are not in one basket, and the curtailed spending-power owing to the low price of wool is counter.

balanced to some extent by the prices ranging for other of our staple products. With a surplus of over half a million last year, and the continued favourable revenue coming in this year, there seemed every prospect that the desire of Ministers to grant concession of taxation, and reduced rates on products carried on our railways, would be consum- mated ; but, in the face of the necessarily in- creased expenditure this year, the more prudent course is to defer any further reduction in re- venue to a more favourable opportunity, and the national expenditure should be cut down to the lowest limit consistent with efficiency after providing for the necessary requirements. The eager and pressing desire for the rapid construction of public works and conveniences has forced borrowing up to a limit beyond which it would not be safe to go. There need be no curtailment of expenditure in respect to obtaining lands for settlement or for roading back blocks and Crown land, which so materi- ally assists in furthering the settlement of the people on the land, or in respect to advancing moneys to settlers, or in pushing on the North Island Main Trunk and other important rail- ways, and in otherwise developing, within reasonable limits, the resources of our colony, for this means increasing the output of pro- ducts and exports, and tends to promote an increased population, which the colony badly needs. In respect to the expenditure on several classes of public works, district railways, and especially buildings and works which are more a matter of convenience than of necessity, pru- dence demands that there should be a reduction in the expenditure thereon, especially seeing that our population is so slowly increasing, for it should be borne in mind that the increased ratio of population is much below that of the in- creased ordinary expenditure. For every million borrowed and expended on non-revenue-pro- ducing works and objects, an annual charge of about 10d. a head is entailed upon every Euro- pean man, woman, and child in the colony. Coming to the demands upon the consolidated revenue, the several services of the colony have necessarily increased, and the strictest economy is necessary ; for if ever the time arrives when increased taxation is required to meet the ordi- nary expenditure, so surely will reductions in salaries eventuate. To avoid the contingency, and the injustice which arose in the past, it is well for those having responsibility to do their utmost to keep down expenditure. In the Budget last year I stated that here- after the aid to Public Works Fund from the surplus in the Consolidated Fund would have to be partially, if not wholly, abandoned. The Public Works requirements of this year are, however, so large that I am compelled to use $500,000 of the surplus, and that amount will be transferred accordingly. I regret again to have to state that, from various causes well known to members, the money market in London continues to be un- favourable to floating loans, and we have had recourse to raising $500,000 locally on short- Mr. Seddon dated debentures bearing 4 per cent. interest. Full particulars of the floating of this local loan will be given. Recently a paragraph appeared in the Press something to this effect : "The needs of the Treasury were so urgent that £100,000 was borrowed from a leading life assurance society at 4 per cent., with a condition that the in- terest would be paid at head office in Sydney." The facts are that the prospectus of the $500,000 local loan, raised in April last, provided for interest being made payable in New Zealand, Australia, and London. Some time after this loan had been closed the society in question asked the Government if it would accept au investment of $100,000; and, seeing that at the time we were selling debentures openly over the counter on terms as to interest similar to those above referred to, we naturally obliged the society and accepted their money. Other institutions and private individuals have also been glad to avail themselves of this further opportunity to invest their money in short- currency security carrying a fair rate of in- terest. The war in South Africa still continues, and the large Imperial loans and other demands upon the London money-market leads me to the conclusion that it will be some little time ere any loan could with advantage be floated in the Mother-country. It becomes necessary, therefore, that a large proportion of the amount required and authorised should be raised locally : and, this being the case, there should be a care- ful public works expenditure until a favourable opportunity for raising the money in London arrives. In accordance with the provisions of the Public Revenues Act, statements have already been published in the New Zealand Gazette showing the receipts and expenditure in the Consolidated Revenue and Public Works and other Accounts. As upon former occasions, tables will be attached to my Budget giving a variety of information concerning the transac- tions of the last financial year. Having given a general summary of the situation, which, viewed in the light of the elasticity of our re- sources, is, if anything, on the side of caution, I will now proceed to give the details of the receipts and expenditure of last year. FINANCES OF 1900-1901. # Revenue. The actual revenue for the past financial year reached $5,852,705, to which has to be added $52,800 derived from the proceeds of sale of debentures for sinking fund accretions, and a small sum of $1,411 recovered in connection with expenditure of the previous year. These amounts reach the large total of $5,906,916, or not very short of six millions of money, and represent the largest volume of receipts into the colonial Exchequer since its foundation. Compared with the revenue proper of the pre- vious year (1899-1900), which amounted to $5,580,385, there is an excess of £272,320, of which $73,295 was derived from Customs, $43,036 from Stamps, $45,936 from the Land- 
<page:469>
and Income-tax, £99,028 from Railways. Other items of revenue produced a net increase of £11,025. These figures conclusively prove the wonderful progress the colony has made with- out any undue pressure upon the taxpayer to contribute to its revenue. Turning now to a comparison of results between the estimated and the actual revenue for the year ended 31st March last, I find that my estimate has been exceeded by the sum of $429,516. Under all the heads of revenue except one the estimates have been exceeded. The following are the figures : Under Customs, $157,861; Stamps, $48,935 ; Land- and Income-tax. £43,393 : Beer Duty, $2,170; Railways, €146,241 ; Marine, €3,353 ; Miscellaneous, £2,411 ; Territorial, €30,203 ; and Recoveries, £1,411. Under the head of Registration and other Fees the revenue was £6,462 less than was expected. A word or two of explanation of these increases may be necessary. First, as to the Customs revenue- which I have mentioned as being $73,295 more than the previous year, and $157,861 in excess of my estimate -- I may remark that in my estimate for the year I took off nearly $85,000 from the actual receipts of the previous year, so as to provide against the anticipated loss arising out of concessions which I had stated in my Budget would probably reach £157,000. In spite, however, of the reduction of duty made on leading lines of goods, there has been an extraordinary clearing of other lines untouched by tariff alterations, which have resulted in large increases of revenue. Take, for instance, duty on spirits, increased by £22,800 ; tobacco, €15,800; cigars and cigar- ettes, £9,100 ; sugar, £3,500 ; ad valorem goods and other items, $98,000. These items, which are mainly luxuries, may be taken as clearly de-    monstrating the increased earning-power of our colonists, and the prosperity which arises there- from. It is quite likely that the visit of their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York to some extent inflated the figures connected with the ad valorem duties. At all the gatherings to welcome our future King, I was impressed with the appearance of thorough content and prosperity which was exhibited by the vast crowds assembled to do honour to the Duke and his amiable wife the Duchess. Last year the stamp revenue increase of nearly $49,000 over the estimate was caused by anticipating a reduction of $20,000 from the penny-postage concession which in reality did not take place, the sales of the new stamps making good any loss arising from the reduced rate, while the dredging " boom " is, I think, responsible for a large increase in the sale of adhesive stamps. Impressed stamps sales, and the bank composition, were considerably in- creased over the estimates. The concession made by my worthy colleague the Postmaster - General has given universal satisfaction ; and I feel sure the loss to the revenue by the adoption of an universal penny postage will be rapidly made good by increased correspondence. Concerning the increase over the estimate of mention that the land-tax was within .£500 of my expectations, and the income-tax exceeded them by nearly £43,000. The Railways revenue has produced a very handsome surplus over my colleague's esti- mate, which was the exceedingly high one of £1,574,400. The passenger traffic and the goods carried continue to be maintained, and afford a sure barometer of the substantial prosperity of our colonists and of the development of our industries. The increase over the estimate of €30,000 in Territorial Revenue arises from land sales for cash, £18,000; and from rents of pastoral runs and miscellaneous items altogether amounting to £12,000. With regard to the item of £6,400 over-estimated under Registration and other Fees, I find that I was over sanguine as to the fees to be received under " The Government Valuation of Land Act, 1896" : these fell short of my estimate by about £6,000. # Expenditure. The actual expenditure during 1900-1901 was £5,479,703. Similar expenditure during the preceding year totalled £5,140,127, showing an increased cost of £339,576 during last year. The permanent appropriations are answerable for nearly $50,000, of which the Old-age Pen- sions contributed an extra cost of £39,500, and Subsidies to Local Bodies £7,500. With in- creased revenue, increased expenditure may be expected, and it is therefore not surprising to find that the departmental expenditure was in excess of that of the previous year by £289,670 under the annual appropriations. The increased expenditure on the Railways amounted to £105,500 ; on Defence, £64,400. The Post and Telegraph services cost an extra £27,700, and the Miscellaneous vote of the Colonial Secretary's Department is mainly answerable for the increased expenditure of £18,500 in Class II., Colonial Secretary. It may, I think, be broadly stated that in the other departments of the State the expenditure has been increased so as to keep in line with the increased requirements of our colonists, and to provide for the expenditure which our liberal legislation sanctions for the good of the people, be they rich or poor. Comparing the actual expenditure of the year with the estimates, members will find from the table appended to my Budget that the expenditure was less than estimated in some directions to the extent of £206,940, while in others it exceeded the esti- mate by £113,350. Of the latter amount the Railways were answerable for £75,500, and The net Services not provided for, £25,500. saving in the expenditure, as compared with the estimate, was £93,590. Result. The revenue for the year was £5,906,916, and the ordinary expenditure £5,479,703, leaving a balance of £427,213. Out of the balance brought forward from the previous year (1899-1900) of £605,351, a transfer of $500,000 was made to the Public Works Fund, leaving £105,351 to be 
<page:470>
producing at the close of the year a balance amounting to £532,564, which I indicated in my introductory remarks. I feel sure honour- able members will join with me in congratulating the colony upon such a successful result. # THE PUBLIC WORKS FUND. The transactions on both sides of the account of the Public Works Fund were largely increased last year. The ordinary expenditure exceeded that of the previous year by £315,000, and necessarily extra funds had to be found. To provide for the expenditure, the balance of the loan of 1899, amounting to $700,000, was raised, also $200,000 under the Act of last session. The total figures, as shown in the accounts which are appended, are, receipts, £1,901,787, The balance and expenditure, £1,809,021. brought forward was $139,749, and the balance at the end of the past year amounted to £232,515. LOANS TO LOCAL BODIES ACCOUNT. The balance at credit of the Loans to Local Bodies Account on 31st March, 1900, was £20,593. Debentures for £176,000 were created and issued during the past year, and refunds of unspent balances of grants, together with a pay- ment made in reduction of the inscribed debt, were received, amounting in all to £7,726. Pay- ments on account of loans were made during the year: to local bodies, £138,956, and to- wards opening up blocks of land for settlement, £37,390; leaving at the end of last year a  balance of £27,973 to the credit of the account. Up to the 31st March last, the total amount of debentures created and issued and carried into this account was £1,530,900, and the total disbursements have been : to local bodies, €1,138,497; to Lands and Survey Department, towards opening up blocks of land for settle- ment, £282,356; and to Public Works Fund, €89,800, in exchange for debentures under "The Roads and Bridges Construction Act, 1882." The business connected with the granting of loans to local bodies still continues to consider- ably increase, the payments last year being more than double those of the preceding year, and the largest amount that has been advanced since the commencement of the Act. This is no doubt attributable to the fact that late legis- lation has granted greater facilities whereby local bodies can obtain assistance. "The Go- vernment Loans to Local Bodies Act Amend- mont Act, 1898," which was specially framed for the purposes of providing for irrigation, water-supply, &c., has been largely availed of, and in consequence there has been correspond- ing increase in the amount of loans made. The Public Health Act and the Slaughtering and Inspection Act of last session permit of loans being granted for sanitary works, and for the erection of abattoirs. Applications under these Acts are now being received. By "The Government Loans to Local Bodies Act Amendment Act, 1900," the rate of interest on loans was reduced from 5 to 4} per cent. per annum ; local bodies also being able to readjust Mr Seddon 34 per cent. per annum-upon correspondingly extending the currency of their loans. Of the total inscribed debt of local bodies, amounting to £1,222,234, the following figures will show what a great advantage the Amend- ment Acts of 1899 and 1900 have proved to local bodies, and to what extent they have availed themselves of the opportunity of re- ducing their rate of interest :- Amount of loans reduced to- 874,443 4} per cent. .. .. . . 12,634 4 per cent. . . . 3} per cent. 335,157 . . £1,222,234 I am pleased to be enabled to report that the payments of the half-yearly instalments of in- terest on the inscribed debts continue to be fully and punctually paid. ## LAND-TAX AND INCOME-TAX. The proceeds of the land-tax only exceeded those of the preceding year by about $1,000, the department having been unable from a defect in the Valuation Act to place the increased valua- tions upon the rolls for last year. 'The income- tax receipts, however, brought up the revenue from direct taxation to an amount which it has never before reached, affording evidence of un- exampled prosperity in the colony generally, as well as careful departmental administration. When I inform honourable members that during the last nine years the income-tax has been in force the number of taxpayers has more than doubled, and the revenue has increased by £106,000 a year, the result must be considered satisfactory. A careful revision of the land-values of the colony is now in progress, but it will take some time yet to complete this work. The result so far is a net increase of the capital value of €8,390,000, and of the unimproved value of £6,375,000. The gain to the land tax revenue this year I estimate at £10,000, and I see no reason, notwithstanding the unfortunately low price of wool, why the land-tax should not increase year by year in sympathy with other heads of revenue until, at all events, the whole revision of the valuations has been completed. # THE LAND FOR SETTLEMENTS ACCOUNT. The balance brought forward amounted to £53,389, and by the sale of debentures under "The Land for Settlements Consolidation Act, 1900," funds were obtained to the amount of €219,000. Rents and other moneys came into the account to the extent of $72,796. On the other side the purchase-money for the acquire- ment of estates totalled #186,621, interest on debentures amounted to $50,910, and expenses to $14,305. The balance of the account at the close of the year was $93,349. The purchase of land for close settlement is being vigorously pushed forward, and it is pleasing to know that the estates which have been hitherto purchased have been satisfactorily settled. During the last year approximately 
<page:471>
177 farms were provided and about 170 work- men's homes. The following table gives the names of the provincial districts in which the land during the year has been purchased, the acreage, and the prices paid therefor :- Price. Acres.

The gross public debt on the 31st March, 1900, was £47,874,452; and on the 31st March, 1901, it was £49,591,245, or an increase of £1,716,793 for the year. The net public debt on the 31st March last was £48,557,751, showing £1,627,675 of net increase for the debt during the year. Analysing the above-stated increase, I find that, as I have before mentioned, £900,000 of new loan-money has been raised for the Public Works Fund, consisting of £700,000 under " The Aid to Public Works and Land Settle- ment Act, 1899," and #200,000 under the similar loan Act of last session. The require ments of the Advances to Settlers Office ne- cessitated our raising £380,000; and for the purchase of estates for close settlement we obtained £219,000. To enable grants to be made to local authorities £176,000 had to be borrowed, and further sums of £1,781 and $2,000 for dairy industries and the Govern- ment Accident Insurance respectively. £17,902 was deposited in New Zealand Consols, and $52,800, representing debentures for accretions of sinking funds, were disposed of, as also £18,000 of 3-per-cent. inscribed stock. On the other hand, £50,400 5-per-cent. debentures were paid off under "The Consolidated Loan Act, 1867," and $290 under "The Naval and Military Settlers' and Volunteers' Land Act, 1892." With respect to the interest upon nearly £800,000 of the moneys raised last year, it is right to mention that no burden will be im- posed upon the taxpayers, such interest being recouped according to the conditions under which the loans have been applied, so that these loans are virtually self-supporting. With regard to the balance, it is impossible to assist our settlers in developing our country without providing them with roads and bridges, and to provide for such expenditure it is essential that moneys shall be found out of loan. By the same means only can our railways system be extended, and effect be given to the wishes of honourable members and the people with regard to a vigorous prosecution towards the completion of our main lines. During the year £509,500 of debentures under "The Government Loans to Local Bodies Act, 1886," fell due, and were renewed under the provisions of "The Consolidated Stock Act, 1884." The Bank of New Zealand having paid $500,000, the value of its preferred shares, that amount was handed over to the Public Trustee, and by him invested in a like amount of deben- tures under "The Aid to Public Works and Land Settlement Act, 1899," held at the time by the Bank of New Zealand as security for advances made under the said loan. I observe that only two parcels of debentures will have to be provided for during the current year-namely, £250,000 under "The Aid to Public Works and Land Settlement Act, 1896," and £300,000 under the Land for Settlements Acts, 1894 and 1897. The former parcel is held by the Post Office, and can be renewed, and the latter was a London issue convertible into 3-per-cent. in- scribed stock. OUR RECENT $500,000 LOAN FLOTATION. Our financial advisers in London having re- ported unfavourably of the state of the money- market, and that a very low figure would be obtained for a 3-per-cent. loan, it was deter- I am pleased mined to tap our own resources. to say the result more than justified this action, as the recent flotation proved a complete success. The amount to be subscribed was $500,000, authorised by "The Aid to Public Works and Land Settlement Act, 1900." It was decided to make the issue at 4 per cent., with the price fixed at par. The loan was freely advertised throughout the colony, and also in Melbourne and Sydney. Tenders were opened on the 23rd April last, and it was found that the amount applied for was £861,800, represented by 126 tenders. The average price offered was £100 1s. 6d., the highest tender being at £102; and the lowest £100 Os. 6d. 112 tenders re- ceived allotment-62 over par, and 50 at par. The average price over par yielded £100 68. 7d. The allotment was made so as to embrace the largest number of small tenders and to en. courage bona fide investors. No less than 98 tenders have been accepted for sums of £5,000 and under-namely, 19 tenders for £200 and under, 9 from £200 to £400, 25 from £400 to £600, 5 from £600 to £800, 15 from £800 to £1,000, and 25 from £1,000 to £5,000. The remaining 14 tenders were in sums from £8,000 to £100,000. Australia received 29 allotments, in sums ranging from £200 to £50,000, and, with the exception of one tender, at premiums of from 1s. to 16s. over par. The offer to make interest and principal payable either in 
<page:472>
duced offers for investment of moneys which we should otherwise not have received, and the action has been favourably commented on in leading financial journals. No fees for brokerage were paid ; the expenses have been very light, rather less than & per cent., con- sisting only of advertising, and commission to the bank for transmission of money from Australia to Wellington. An allowance at the rate of 1} per cent. per annum was made to tenderers who chose to pay their final instal- ment before the due date. £43,312 was for- warded as a deposit by would-be investors, and of this sum £18,035 was returned to tenderers who were unsuccessful. Sixty-nine investors availed themselves of the discount allowed on payments made in full prior to due date of last in- stalment, and £345,459 was received under this condition, and £223 was allowed for discount. On the 7th May last, the date of the first instal- ment, £61,605 was received ; and on the date of the last instalment (4th June), $67,949 was paid in to complete the half-million subscribed. To complete the security required by the in- vestors, 1,658 debentures have been printed. The local emission has proved a very great suc- cess, and, although the rate is high in compari- son with late issues, the expenses have been so small that I think we may consider we have got our money nearly, if not quite, as cheaply as, under present conditions, a 3-per-cent. loan could have been obtained. The currency is short, running only until 1st April, 1904. Mr. Seddon  1900-1901. There has been considerable adverse criti- cism, and assertions have been made to the effect that there has been undue increase in the expenditure during the last ten years. It is quite true that there has been a largely in- creased expenditure, and that necessarily so, for we have a largely increased population, and also a greatly increased revenue. We have now also in existence departments of State which were in 1891 unknown, and many of them un- thought-of at the time. Total Expenditure and Revenue. Total Expenditure.

REVENUES RECEIVED, 1891 TO 1900-1901. It will be interesting, and remove misgiving, if in simple form the revenues received through the principal revenue-producing departments of the State during the year 1891 and the year 1901 are placed before members. The following table gives the actual receipts for each year respec- tively :- 1890-91. £ Customs 1,527,207 .. 631,191 Stamps 357,348 Property-tax . .

Totals .. £4,158,774 . . # POPULATION. Arrivals, Departures, Births, Deaths. In my introductory remarks I expressed the opinion that the colony was in need of an increased population. The latest census of the people proved that during the last five years our population had been, relatively to the pre- vious five years-that is, from 1891 to 1896- actually decreased in number by 7,366 per- sons. The opinion of the late Hon. John Bal- lance, as expressed in his Budget in 1891, may not be out of place, showing as it does the bear- ing an increased or decreased population has upon the prosperity of the colony. Mr. Bal- lance said,-   "I consider it my duty to direct the attention of the Committee to the lesson conveyed by the census returns of the population recently issued. Briefly, the rough results of the census, as shown by enumerators, give a population, subject to revision, of 623,352 persons, not including Maoris, against 578,482 persons in March, 1886, making an increase for the five years of 44,870. But the natural increase for this period, being the excess of births over deaths, is 64,168 persons ; so that the loss by excess of departures over arrivals is 19,298. "The arrivals recorded in the five years were 73,386, and the departures 83,948, giving a loss of 10,562 persons. It would thus appear that the unrecorded departures amounted to 8,736 persons.

"Now, here is a loss of wealth and wealth- producing power, in the departure of so many people from our shores to seek employment in other colonies, which demands the serious con- sideration of Parliament."

The rapid and continued growth of the busi- ness of our railways-the principal highways and means of communication between the various parts of the colony-is one of the best indications of the continued healthy and pro- sperous condition of the colony. The lines were taken over by the Government in January, 1895, and on the 31st March of that year the number of miles of line open for traffic was 1,993, and train-miles run 3,221,620. At the close of the last financial year, 31st March, 1901, the mileage open was 2,212, and the train-miles run 4,620,971. During the year ending 31st March, 1895, the railways carried 3,905,578 passengers, 28,623 season - ticket holders, 444,981 parcels, 750 carriages, 705 drays, 40,890 cattle, 1,519,921 sheep, 43,292 pigs, 36,972 tons of lime, chaff, et cetera, 85,102 tons firewood, 198,578 tons timber, 388,556 tons grain, 377,938 tons merchandise, 857,917 tons minerals ; earned a gross revenue of £1,150,851 ; and gave employment to 4,957 men. For the year ending 31st March, 1901, they carried 6,243,593 passengers, 82,921 season - ticket holders, 633,770 parcels, 1,336 carriages, 1,566 drays, 72,868 cattle, 2,412,191 sheep, 51,059 pigs, 78,844 tons chaff, lime, et cetera, 92,830 tons firewood, 380,803 tons timber, 772,571 tons grain, 551,879 tons merchandise, 1,366,241 tons minerals ; earned a gross revenue of £1,727,236 ; and gave employment to 7,793 men. Thus the traffic for the year ending 31st March, 1901, shows an increase over that for the year ending 31st March, 1895, of 1,399,351 train-miles, 2,338,015 passengers, 54,298 season tickets, 188,789 parcels, 586 carriages, 861 drays, 31,978 cattle, 892,270 sheep, 7,767 pigs, 1,291,296 tons of goods traffic of various classes, £576,385 in revenue, and 2,836 in the number of men employed. The actual profit, year ending 31st March, 1901 : £599,389, as against £571,533 for pre- vious year. Capital cost of railways open for traffic, £17,207,328. Profit on working gives £3 9s. 8d., as com- pared with £3 8s. 5d. for last year. Taking into consideration the large reduc- tions in passenger and other rates, the increased cost of materials, coal, iron, et cetera, and the increased wages, this result is eminently satis- factory, and the figures are, I venture to think, Increase. 1896. 1901.

Notwithstanding the fact that the increased traffic during the past six years has been of such a phenomenal character, there is every indication that the business for the present financial year will be fully equal to that of the preceding year. # RAILWAY CONCESSIONS. In connection with results of working the railways for last financial year the large con- cessions in rates granted by the Government since resuming control of the lines should not be lost sight of, as they have a very material effect on the results for the year. The total reductions made since the Government took over the railways amounted, up to last year, to no less than £369,439, and to 31st March, 1901, to £420,239. The following are the principal concessions granted, and the estimated value of the reduc- tions for one year :- Reduction- Live-stock rates 25,000 Firewood, chaff, and lime 8,000 Free carriage of lime, butter, eggs, and fish empties 1,500 .. Abolition of extra charge of- One penny per ton on branch lines 3,000 Agricultural produce 45,000 . . .. Butter and cheese 5,000 · · Artificial manures 1,000 . . Bricks, clay, coal, &c. 3,000 ..

Total of £165,000 In addition to the items enumerated, reduc- tions have from time to time been made on a very large number of articles of every-day use carried over the railways. The regulations have been made of a more liberal character than heretofore, train services improved, speeds increased, and additional trains, involving an expenditure of many tens of thousands per annum, have been provided ; and, to further meet the convenience of the public, goods and.

the volume of business has warranted such a ; step. NORTH ISLAND MAIN TRUNK RAILWAY. The central route having been finally deter- mined upon for the North Island Main Trunk Railway, immediate steps were taken to put further work in hand. The formation is now well advanced between Kawakawa and Tau- maranui, while bushfelling, et cetera, is in hand south of the Wanganui River. From the south end the works extend nearly to Turangarere, , the said lines of railway, estimated by you as all the important works on this section being fully manned. The erection of the Makohine Viaduct is progressing satisfactorily, notwith- standing that the work has been retarded by continued bad weather. The viaduct will be completed during the coming summer, and simultaneously the railway will be opened to Mangaweka. The amount voted last session was suffi- cient to cover the requirements for the year, but an increased amount will be necessary for the coming year. MIDLAND RAILWAY. In accordance with the resolution passed by the Public Accounts Committee last session, a Royal Commission was appointed, and, after a very exhaustive inquiry, has reported, prac- tically, that the company and debenture-holders have been very well treated. They find that the total expenditure by the company on the railway was $1,108,628, of which only £654,411 was expended on the actual construction and equipment of the railway, and the balance- -£454,217-on supervision, commission, sala- ries, cost of raising capital, interest charged to capital account, and incidentals. The Commission states that the financial charges in connection with the undertaking were enormous in comparison with the work done, and that the sums paid for the debenture interest, shareholders' interest, cost of raising money on debentures, administration, engineer- | revenue-producing purposes, yet notwithstand- ing, and law-costs were out of all proportion to the amount expended on construction and equip- ment. They further report that the selling- value of the whole railway, based on the revenue earned, and allowing for prospective increase for ten years, is .€192,833, and that the amount realised by the company from the Government land-grant was £313,060, or £50,195 in excess of the value at which the grant was debited to the company. They also find that the Go- Telegraph- Number ordinary telegrams .. Value Number urgent telegrams Value Number Press telegrams Value Number bureau communications Value Total number paid messages ..

The Commission were asked to ascertain the selling-value, and, on an assumption as to rela- tive losses, to apportion under the following conditions : " The said lines of railway having been constructed by means of moneys provided partly by the shareholders in the said company, partly by moneys raised upon debentures, and partly by moneys provided by us by our said grants of land and out of our Colonial Treasury. in what proportion should the money value of aforesaid, be apportioned among the three said several contributors to the cost of construc- tion ? " The Commissioners, on the hypothetical basis that the several contributing parties towards the creation of this asset should share in its distribution rateably, apportioned the selling- value of $192,833 as follows : To the debenture- holders, £126,788; to the company, nil ; to the Crown, £66,045. It will be seen, however, that £654,411 only was expended on the construction and equip- ment of the line, and of this sum the amounts realised by the company from the Government land-grant formed nearly one-half, whilst taking the selling-value of the line at $192,833, and the amount realised from land-grant at $313,000, it will be found that £120,237 has been pro- vided by the colony in excess of the selling- value of the line. The petitions of the debenture-holders and of the company, presented last session, should be dealt with this session. POST AND TELEGRAPHS. The Post and Telegraph is one of the most important departments of State, and is in- separably interwoven with the public finance. and is one of the barometers that never fails to disclose the progress of the colony and the condition of the people. In character it is more for the convenience of the people than for ing the many unpaid services performed it has proved more than self-supporting. Last year the expenditure was £416,363, and the receipts £503,181 ; this year the expenditure is esti. mated at £441,214, and the revenue is antici- pated to reach £485,800. To show the increased business in connection with the telegraph and telephone services since the year 1890 the following table is submitted for the information of honourable members :- Increase 1900. 1890. per Cent. 1,465,992 2,792,871 90.51 4 31.00 £71,307 15 £93,474 14 2 35,667 154,406 332.91 £10,251 8 9 4 £4,749 17 115-86 267,919 38.9 192,882 £8,785 7 10 £11,866 19 8 35.08 239,432 39,840 500.08 £1,111 4 0 £6,830 10 7 514.855 1,734,381 3,454,628 99-19 £85,954 4 £122,423 13 6 2 42.43 226,780 365,079 60.98 £26,070 12 7 £37,680 1 2 44.53

The Post-Office Savings-Banks show a marked increase both in the volume of business and in the total amount at credit of depositors. Last year the excess of deposits (£4,170,428) over with- drawals (₺3,827,416) amounted to £343,012 over the previous year, and the interest credited to depositors to €146,169, while the total accumu- lated savings stood on the 31st December at $5,809,552, an average of £29 8s. 7d. to credit of each of the 197,408 depositors. Compared with the year ended 31st December, 1890, the increase is almost phenomenal, the total at credit having increased from £2,441,876 to £5,809,552, or at the rate of 137.91 per cent., Number of Accounts with Balances. £100 to £200.

Out of the statutory capitation of £3 15s. per annum on the average attendance, which is paid to the Boards of Education, these Boards have to pay teachers' salaries and allowances, the incidental expenses of School Committees, and their own office expenses, together with the cost of the inspection of schools ; receiving, however, an additional grant of £4,000 per annum towards this last item. The circum- stances of the various Boards are very different, and it is practically impossible for the Boards of the smaller districts, and even for the larger Boards (such as Auckland) in whose districts small schools are numerous, to pay salaries equal to those paid in districts in which there is a greater number of large schools. The con- sequent anomalies and irregularities in the salaries of teachers occupying similar positions i schools, where the first scale is already suffi- Increase 1890. 1900. per Cent. 1,961,161 3,819,707 94.77 £112,024 17 £160,103 14 4 42.92 1 540 977 80.93 8,190 215.97 2,592 21,501,937 37,421,228 74.03 991,065 1,858,064 87.5 8,691,522 12,347,374 42.1 199,220 64.2 121,292 42.36 1,185 1,686 £222,881 £316,202 41.87 representing an increase in the average amount at credit of each account of £4 6s. 3d. The in- terest paid in 1900 was £146,169, as against £92,319 in 1890, an increase equal to 58.33 per cent. Classifying the accounts, it will be found that those with balances up to £100 increased from 90,115 to 178,405, or 97-97 per cent .; from £100 to $200, from 4,750 to 11,173, or 135-22 per cent .; from £200 to $300, from 1,502 to 5,151, or 242.94 per cent .; and above $300, from 841 to 2,679, or 218.54 per cent. The total number of accounts open increased from 97,208 to 197,408, or 103.08 per cent. Attached is a com- parative statement for the years 1890-1900- Above £300.

So many issues were in- volved that it seemed best to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the whole question. The report of the Commissioners contains two scales of staffs and salaries for public schools : the first, which involves an expenditure of £4 per head on the average attendance in all the public schools of the colony, is a vast improve- ment on the existing conditions. The second, which the Commission strongly recommends, is on the basis of $4 2s. 6d. per head ; it has the same general features as to staffing and salaries as the first, but the salaries are higher by about $5 all round, except in the smallest 
<page:478>
ciently liberal ; the salaries under the second scale, in fact, would mean, with very few ex- ceptions, a general levelling-up. As to the ex- ceptions, the Commission suggests that for two years no salaries should be lowered, and, as the cost of the concession would be trifling, this suggestion may readily be adopted without in- terfering with the general scheme. Since January of the present year, with the £3 15s. statutory capitation and the special vote of 5s. per head, the total payments have been at a rate practically equivalent to a capi- tation of £4 on the total average attendance. Last year the appropriation for capitation was £398,000; this year £416,200 is required to be voted, which is £18,200 in excess of the amount voted last year. Next year-the finances of the colony permitting, as I believe they will- we hope to be able to provide for the payment of teachers on the second scale recommended. MANUAL AND TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION. The administration of the Manual and Tech- nical Instruction Act of last session has en- gaged the attention of the Government during the recess. Organizing Inspectors have been appointed, and the regulations required to give effect to the Act have been issued. The terms of these regulations, I believe, are such as to offer a degree of encouragement to manual and technical education as liberal as is offered by the State in any part of the world. The Inspectors have already visited nearly every part of the colony, have met teachers and  others interested, giving model lessons and such information and advice as will enable local controlling authorities to begin work on the best lines, or to extend their work where it has been already begun. The Inspectors have also in hand a series of small manuals suggesting suit- able programmes of work in manual and tech- nical classes. One of the most satisfactory features of the movement is the degree of in- terest that is being manifested in regard to the introduction of hand-and-eye training into the schools of the colony. Inasmuch as trained teachers are essential for effective work, special grants have been given to all the Boards of Education to enable them to establish classes for giving manual instruction to teachers. The extension of technical education proper will be sufficiently indicated when I say that since the passing of the Act there have been some forty or fifty applications for grants in aid of build- ings, apparatus, and material. The expenditure under the head of technical instruction, exclusive of grants for building, for the year ending 31st March, 1901, was £2,690 ; the expenditure this year may be esti- mated at €14,000 or €15,000 exclusive of build- ing grants, which last year amounted to $2,178. This year we anticipate an expenditure of £10,000 or $12,000 upon buildings and appa- ratus. After a few years the grants in aid of buildings and apparatus may be expected to decrease as the need is generally satisfied ; while, on the other hand, the grants for capi- tation and other current items will increase year by year for some time. Mr. Seddon GOLD-MINING. Gold-mining generally is steadily progressing, and, although many companies which were floated more for the purpose of collecting calls from shareholders than for the purpose of win- ning the precious metal have been and are being wiped out of existence, the yield of gold is increasing. The quantity and value exported for the half-year ended 30th June last was 217,478 oz., valued at £844,888, being an in- crease of 38,175 oz., valued at £150,029, over the first half of the year 1900, and, as compared with the first half of the year 1899-when the quantity of gold exported for the year was 389,558 oz., valued at £1,513,173, being the highest for twenty-six years previously-the export shows an increase of 24,347 oz., value £94,389. It is not unreasonable, therefore, to expect that the yield for the present year will equal, if not exceed, that for the year 1899. # RIPARIAN RIGHTS. The scope of the Commission referred to in last year's Statement as having been set up to inquire and report as to claims for compensation in respect to riparian rights, and land affected by dredging in Otago and Southland, was ex- tended so as to include all rivers in the Middle Island; and the Commission has now concluded its investigations, resulting in reports having been made on forty-six rivers, of which number six have been proclaimed, and compensation amounting to £5,799 13s. 4d. paid. Notices of application to proclaim twenty-four rivers have been issued, but, as the period of ninety days within which claims for compensation can be received has not expired, the total sum that may be claimed is not yet known. On some of the more important rivers on which agricultural lands will be affected by mining it is feared the individual claims will be large ; but, as in many cases the farmers have disposed of the portions of their holdings fronting rivers and streams for dredging purposes, the compensation clainis will have to be considerably reduced before such rivers or streams are proclaimed. The question of a fair and equitable settle- ment between the riparian right holders and the mining community is beset with many difficulties. If, however, a conciliatory spirit is exhibited on both sides, and with the infor- mation before the Government resulting from the inquiries of the Commission, it is expected that in most cases the conflicting interests will be adjusted. # STATE COAL-MINES. The time has arrived when the colony should supply itself with coal. The output at present does not adequately meet requirements. Pri- vate enterprise is not meeting the general and increased demand. The annual consumption of coal for the several branches of the public services amounts to about 115,000 tons. The railways alone require 100,000 tons per year ; of this, 65,000 tons are hard or bituminous coal. It is estimated that the bituminous coal should be obtained at from 5s. to 7s. 6d. per ton less 
<page:479>
coal delivered for one of the Government steamers at Greymouth we are asked 17s. 6d. a ton, and it is well known that the same coal can be actually, and with profit, put on board at 10s. The inadequate supply and the increas- ing demand have brought about an undesirable situation. There is a combination of the coal- dealers, and the mine-owners are working in unison with them, the result being that ab- normally high prices are charged to the con- sumers. The effect of opening a State coal- mine will ameliorate, if it does not remove, this evil. In the course of time, and should the necessity therefor arise, we could, in addition to supplying our own State demands, extend the output so as to enable coal to be supplied to householders at reasonable rates. Another valid reason for the State stepping in is the necessity that exists for having a reserve of coal, at least at the four centres, to meet contingencies that might arise. At the present time the arrival of extra steamers and vessels requiring coal interferes with the ordinary de- mand, and a coal-famine ensues. We have had several in the last year or two ; and that there should be a coal-famine in a country like New Zealand, which is teeming with coal, points to a serious defect, the remedy for which is the opening of a State coal-mine. The House will, this session, be asked to pass the necessary legislation, grant the authority, and provide the means for working a State coal-mine. REDUCTION OF MORTGAGE-TAX.  32106019788246 In my last Budget I stated that " for some considerable time the interest on mortgages has steadily decreased. During the past ten years interest on mortgages has fallen about one- fourth ; this makes the penny in the pound on capital value a very heavy tax." I have not altered my opinion, and still consider that the mortgage-tax is too high, and that some relief should be given, provided the finances of the colony permit. Whilst desiring to keep good faith with Parliament, to do so this session would be imprudent, unless the loss of revenue occasioned thereby is recouped. # FINANCE OF 1901-1902. Expenditure. As I have already mentioned, the suggestions for departmental expenditure caused me no little anxiety, for I was confronted with esti- mates involving what appeared to be at first sight extraordinarily large expenditure. After careful examination and pruning, I am able to submit estimates of expenditure which, although undoubtedly large in the aggregate, taking into consideration the abnormal and non-recurrent expenditure they contain. The estimates for 1901-1902 are set down at $5,763,814. The actual expenditure of last year amounted to $5,479,703. There is there- fore a proposed increase over last year's ex- penditure of £284,111, and I will, as concisely as possible, run over the various heads of ex- penditure which cause this large excess. Loans recently raised caused an addition of some £70,000 for interest, while the old-age pensions is answerable for #18,000, which is most of the excess in expenditure under permanent Acts. In the Colonial Secretary's Department the visit of their Royal Highnesses has necessitated provision for £50,000, and £18,000 is required for the census. Exception will not, I feel sure, be taken to the expenditure incurred upon the Royal visit. It was the general desire of the people that the reception and entertaining should be creditable to our colony, befitting the great occasion, and pleasing to our future King and his gracious lady. The in- creased volume of the business of the Postal and Telegraph Departments has ne- cessitated additional clerical assistance, and, with the ordinary increases arising from the classification, has added some £15,000 to the postal and telegraph estimates, in addition to a loss of some $7,000 as contributions to the San Francisco service. I have already mentioned the increase in the proposed expenditure for educational services, and shall refer more at length to this subject hereafter. The Depart- ment of Agriculture is rapidly growing, and the officers are undoubtedly of great service to the farming community. To meet the extra calls upon the department a good many more skilled officers have been engaged, consequently extra expense incurred ; but it must be borne in mind that the department obtains payment for the services rendered in the shape of fees, which are paid into the Consolidated Fund. The increases in other departments are small, and scarcely call for comment. I may again men- tion that out of the #284,000 of proposed in- creased expenditure this year (of which £210,000 belongs to the annual appropriations) fully £120,000 arises from exceptional items, which are not likely to be of a recurring character, to which we must add the increased cost of postal and telegraph and educational services, which amount to quite £90,000, and are con- sequent upon the progress of our commercial and social surroundings and of our higher civilisation. Thus the excessive expenditure disappears, and I feel sure that members will not complain when the various votes come to be considered by them.

It is now necessary to review the estimates of revenue, which I have set down at $5,839,000, together with £57,000 receipts to be derived from sale of debentures for sinking fund accre- tions. These two sums total to £5,896,000. Last year the actual receipts amounted to $5,905,506, showing that there is an estimated falling-off of revenue to the amount of $9,506 during this current year. I have no desire to be pessimistic, but one cannot be too cautious while framing the estimates for the year. It is only necessary to look around to see the solid evidence of prosperity which meets the eye; at the same time I have to bear in mind that extraordinary events took place : during the last financial year-events which undoubtedly had their effect in augmenting our revenue-events which are not likely to occur again, neither will others of a kindred character take their place : I allude to the visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York. The visit of their Royal Highnesses must have Mr. Seddon Differences. Estimato Actual for of 1901-2. 1900-1. Increase.

On the other hand, we must not lose sight of the effect of the remissions which were made in the tariff in August last. Had it not been for the increased consumption of dutiable goods which has been noticeable for i some years past, and for the extraordinary ex- penditure I have just referred to connected with the Royal visit, there would have been a loss of revenue to the extent of £130,000, and I must still reckon for a loss of Customs revenue in connection with the reduction of duty to the extent of at least $100,000 for the current year. Some portion of this loss will, how- ever, be made good by the increased consump. tion of articles not affected by the tariff alterations ; so I have set down the esti- mated Customs revenue at $2,110.000, or $70,862 less than last year's receipts. It may be that this curtailment of revenue will not take place, but it is best to err. if at all, 
<page:481>
on the safe side. As to the Railways, the | legislation has done away with the imposition returns so far show that the splendid revenue of last year is being not only maintained, but is even exceeded. I feel I am therefore justi- fied in anticipating the receipts will reach £1,760,000, or $39,359 in excess of last year. The Stamp revenue remains substantially the same; I estimate this year's receipts at £903,500 : last year they reached £903,935. In last year's Budget I estimated there would be a loss of revenue arising from the adoption of the penny postage to the amount of £80,000 per annum ; but, owing to the great activity of trade generally, I do not anticipate a greater loss than $24,000 from this source.

ESTIMATED RESULTS AT CLOSE OF 1901-1902. The revenue being estimated at £5,896,000 and the expenditure at £5,763,814, there re- mains a balance of £132,186, to which may be added the balance (£32,564) of the surplus brought forward from last year after allowing for $500,000 to be transferred to the Public Works Fund. These figures produce a balance of £164,750, out of which provision for the supplementary estimates has to be made. CROWN TENANTS' REBATE OF RENTS. Last session the Rebate of Crown Tenants Act was passed. Its working has not been satisfactory, or equitable in its incidence. An amendment of the Act is necessary, and at this juncture it is well to speak plainly, for from facts which have come within my own knowledge it is quite clear that a person taking up bush land, and having little or no capital, cannot pay rent until the land yields a return. There are practically no returns for two years. By that time two years' rent are in arrear, and the yield is not sufficient to maintain the settler and his family. Another two years pass over VOL. CXVII .- 30. of stamp duty upon Native lands : this will entail a loss of some £4,000. On the other hand, there has been a large accession of business in the Telegraph branch, and this, with increasing revenue from other sources, will quite counterbalance any loss which may be sustained by the introduction of the penny postage. Compared with last year's results, there is an estimated increase of some £10,400 to the land-tax and £1,200 to the income-tax. The increases and decreases in the estimates of the other items of revenue are so small as not to call for remark. Differences. Estimate Actual for of 1901-2. 1900-1. Increase.

Under these circumstances, it is much better that the State should insist upon the improvement conditions being strictly complied with, and allow the tenant to sit rent-free for the first four or five years. After that time the tenant would be in a position to pay the rent, and the anxiety and worry caused under the conditions now existing would be avoided. There is also another point worthy of being taken into consideration-namely, that, al- though there is a large area of Crown land available for settlement, most of it is inacces- sible and situated a long way from the centres of population, and is not of extra good quality : therefore some inducement is necessary, which, if given, will tend to promote settlement of the people on our Crown lands, and relieve the existing congestion among those who prefer to go upon the lands acquired under the Land for Settlements Act, thus avoiding the hardships which fall to the lot of the pioneer or back- blocks settler. 
<page:482>
Seeing that the cost of the old-age pensions is alleged to have been a factor in creating the recent unnecessary alarm as to the financial position of the colony, it is well to set the matter at rest, in order to remove the erroneous impressions which have been formed. Last year the amount paid for old-age pensions was £197,292, and this year it is estimated that £215,000 will be sufficient to meet all claims. The increase is therefore £17,708; but, with a surplus of over half a million last year, and, so far, a buoyant revenue this year, that amount is not likely to materially affect the finances of the colony. The increased expenditure in old- age pensions must, however, not be treated lightly, and a careful supervision is necessary, for there are reasons for believing that imposi- tion is practised and that evasion of the law to some extent prevails. It is well known that it has now become quite a profession for some people to go round hunting up applicants amongst the Native race for the old-age pen- sion, and should such applicants prove success- ful these people charge them a high fee for services performed. In view of the large amount now paid, it will not be prudent to press for old-age pensions being made universal, or for any increase in the scale. HELP TO FARMERS AND PRODUCERS .- COOL STORAGE. The importance and desirability of helping those located on and living directly from the products of the soil is admitted by all. How and in what manner this can best be accom- plished is worthy of our best efforts. The establishing of new and increased markets will assist in this direction, and it is essential that the produce for export should be carried at the minimum rates on our railways, and that the cost of transit by sea should be reduced to the lowest limit. With this, however, storage and supervision is required at the distributing end, thus avoiding the forcing of products upon an already glutted market. In respect to exploiting or extending our markets, the trade expert that has been appointed procceds to South Africa next week. He is fully acquainted with what produce is available, and the prices at which it can be placed f.o.b. for shipment. From the information we have to hand it will be necessary to have cool-stores for New Zealand produce established in South Africa. It has also been urged that there is not sufficient storage in the Mother-country for our produce. This opens up a very wide question, and its success or otherwise depends to a great extent as to how far the New Zealand Government proposes to go in for taking control of the frozen-meat in- dustry, and as to what amount of support is obtainable within the colony. The erection of cool-stores in the Mother-country alone would be of little advantage. If, however, the pro- ducers and freezing companies, in conjunction with the Government, could divert the principal trade to the colony's store and regulate the output in Great Britain, the results would be beneficial. The cold-stores should, in any case, Mr. Seddon made this year for erection of cold-stores, and, subject to confirmation by our trade expert, the experiment should first be tried in South Africa. # TRADE WITH SOUTH AFRICA. It will be within the recollection of honour- able members that during the recess Govern- ment called for tenders from steamship-owners for a service between the colony and South Africa. The results were not very encouraging, the amount of subsidy demanded being too high for the service offered ; and the scale of freights was also unsatisfactory. This being the case. and seeing that the Shaw-Savill, New Zealand Shipping, and Tyser Line Companies had de- cided to establish a six-weekly service as an ex- periment, it was decided at the time to take no further action, but to await results. I regret to state there has been little or no improvement, and the condition of affairs is not to any extent improved. Small producers and traders have no chance whatever. Freights, as compared with those from Australia, are very high, and there is no regularity. We have therefore come to the conclusion that to be a success it is essential that a line of steamers trading with South Africa should not go beyond South African ports, but should return to New Zealand; and the autho- rity of the House will be asked to provide the necessary subsidy to authorise a contract being entered into for a period of not less than three years, and to invite public offers therefor. As illustrating the present situation and its draw- backs, I may state that offers were invited for a large order of oats from the Imperial authori- ties, with the result that offers came in from three large traders only : owing to the condi- tions, farmers or small traders could not tender, and the Government were unable to obtain the oats within the price limited, and the order was probably lost to the colony. Such a condition of affairs is not in the best interests of the farmers. It is impossible for the Government itself to take small parcels of grain from the producers, but an opportunity of obtaining suit- able freights should be given them to conduct their business as they think best. # OUR BOYS AT THE FRONT : RETURNED TROOPERS. It will be seen on reference to the Defence estimates that there is a large reduction this year as compared with the amount voted last year under the head of " Contingents." The cost of the First, Second, and Third Con- tingents was borne by the New Zealand Govern- ment, with the exception of the amount paid to them at Imperial rates whilst serving in South Africa. The Fourth and Fifth Contingents were on different terms, and were wholly paid by the Imperial Government. The First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Contingents have returned home. At the present time we have two contingents in South Africa - the Sixth and Seventh. They have taken the place of the Fourth and Fifth. It would be super- fluous for me to say more than that our brave 
<page:483>
have earned the commendation of each and every one of those commanding in South Africa. An attempt has been made, without just ground, to show that prompt payment has not been made to the returned troopers. There is no real foundation for this statement whatever. The Fourth and Fifth Contingents were prac- tically Imperial soldiers. On leaving South Africa certain moneys were given to paymasters, and, on the arrival of the "Tagus " in Otago, we sent down our paymasters with about $800 for the officer commanding the Otago District, Colonel Webb, and since then other moneys have been forwarded, with instructions to pay the men on the officer commanding certifying that the amounts were due. At the present time Colonel Davies and his staff are making out accounts, and as fast as certificates are ob- tainable the moneys are paid. We have already advanced over £3,000. What has caused some confusion has been the fact that some of the men were not paid by the Imperial authorities before leaving South Africa. We are only trustees acting on behalf of the Imperial autho- rities; we cannot pay away moneys unless the certificates are forthcoming that the amounts are due. I have it on the authority of Captain Jackson, who was in charge of the D Squadron of the Fifth Contingent, that he brought money with him from South Africa, and that he has paid all his men. To show how unjust the allegations made are I will give a case in point. A trooper got one of the members of the House to interest himself on his (the trooper's) behalf,  and the trooper telegraphed to know when his pay would be forthcoming. I had the matter immediately attended to, and found there were a couple of pounds coming to him, and had it not been for the extension of the $5 gratuity the man would have been overpaid about $3. The Under-Secretary for Defence has never refused any advance where it is shown that the money is due, and a special staff are kept busy at the present time doing nothing else but pay- ing advances; and we have advanced about $3,000 in excess of the moneys in our hands belonging to the Imperial Government. To show how ludicrous and foolish is the statement which has appeared to the effect that it was owing to the tightness of the New Zealand finances that our boys were not paid, it will be well for me to state that the total amount in- volved is about $20,000. Already we have ad- vanced £3,000, and an application has been made to the Imperial authorities for the amount due by them. In the meantime we have ad- vanced about $3,000, as already stated, and as fast as certificates are given payments are made ; and this course will be followed without, I am happy to say, embarrassing our finances. # FEDERATION WITH AUSTRALIA. As honourable members are aware, a short time ago a Royal Commission was appointed to take evidence in New Zealand and Australia in regard to the federation of this colony with Aus- tralia, and this was reported to be undesirable of the people of this colony. The tariff of the Commonwealth has not as yet been submitted ; but, inasmuch as some eight million pounds is required to meet revenue requirements, it may be taken for granted that there will not be any serious alterations in the Australian tariffs, nor is it likely that the Federal tariff will materially affect the trade relationship as be- tween New Zealand and the Commonwealth. A cordial and friendly feeling exists between this colony and the Commonwealth, and there is no foundation for the fears of many that, be- cause New Zealand has not deemed it prudent to federate, the farmers of this colony will, in sending their products to Australia, be penalised. # BRITISH MAIL-SERVICES. In accordance with what was approved last session, nothing further has been done respect- ing the San Francisco service, and we are, as arranged, paying for actual weight of mail- matter carried, the amount paid last year being about £17,000. The Oceanic Company are anxious that a contract should be entered into for a specified period, and the matter is receiv- ing consideration. The subsidy asked, however, is much higher than would be reasonable for the colony to pay. Whilst it would be inadvis- able to discontinue the San Francisco service if it can be got on fair terms, it would also be a good thing to have direct communication with Canada vin Vancouver if it could be brought about by the payment of a reasonable subsidy. Suggestions have been made that a transhipping service to Fiji to connect with the Vancouver steamers should be established. This would not be acceptable, or meet the requirements of the colony. It has also been suggested that there should be an improved service as between New Zealand and Australia, and, seeing the number of magnificent steamers belonging to various companies trading from Great Britain to Australia, an effort to bring these lines of steamers to our colony is worthy of considera- tion. It is quite feasible, and could be done at a reasonable cost. With regard to the San Francisco and Vancouver mail-services, pro- posals will be submitted to the House later on dealing with these mail-services. ## PACIFIC CABLE. I feel sure that it was with pleasure that honourable members noted that the Pacific cable contract had been entered into ; and pre- parations for the laying of the cable are now being proceeded with. An officer representing the Pacific Cable Board has visited New Zea- land, and, in conjunction with the Superin- tendent of Telegraphs, has selected a site for the cable-station at Doubtless Bay. The com- pletion of this cable is a matter of great im- portance to our colony, and it will enable New Zealand and Australia to have an independent cable between those countries. I regret to say that some friction has arisen owing to the 
<page:484>
contracting parties, having granted concessions to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company inimical to the Pacific cable. Canada strongly resented the transaction, and at one time it looked as though the error committed would imperil the cable. I am pleased to say that the trouble has passed over, and progress is being made with the work. It is not likely that any claims for payment on account of interest will come to charge this year. The Pacific cable will serve as an additional cable route for England, and doubtless the Board will see the propriety of allowing a local service being established between Australia and New Zealand. The rates for the existing lines be- tween Australia and New Zealand are not satis- factory, and it would be in the interests of the Australian Commonwealth, as well as of New Zealand, to have the whole of the cables be- tween these two countries State-owned. ADDITIONAL FUNDS. The minds of honourable members having been relieved in respect to the Consolidated Fund Account, the next-and to many mem- bers the most important-matter demanding attention and consideration is the public works expenditure, the amount of money to be ex- pended, and the amount of money proposed to be raised. It would be out of place for me to trespass on the domain of my colleague the Minister for Public Works by going into details. I may say, however, that we estimate there will be an expenditure of about $1,950,000, the expenditure on railways and roads being approximately about the same as last year. The balance on the 31st March last was £232,515. To this may be added £800,000, the balance of the million loan of last session, and we propose to transfer to the Public Works Fund $500,000 of the surplus of the past year, making the total assets £1,532,515. Seeing the estimated expenditure is £1,950,000, it will therefore be necessary to ask authority for a further loan. In endeavouring to bring our borrowing within reasonable limits consider- able difficulty has been encountered, owing to the heavy expenditure and liabilities which have been incurred during the last four months, and I have some misgiving as to the amount to be asked for which will be sufficient to carry us on till next session ; certainly the greatest care and economy will require to be exercised by myself and colleagues to keep the public works expenditure within the ways and means. We shall be aided in this endeavour if honourable members will restrict their de- mands in respect to the requirements of their districts. The time is most inopportune for extensive borrowing. The prolonged disturbed conditions in the Mother-country, caused by circumstances well within the knowledge of honourable members, has had an effect on the financial world of an abnormal character, and to such an extent as to render it unwise to ask for more than one million ; for a larger sum might prove, at this juncture, injurious to the credit of the colony.

The action of the Imperial Government in agreeing to the extension of the boundary of the colony so as to include the Cook and other Islands has given general satisfaction, and such enlargement taking place on the day of the arrival of their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York was pleasing in the extreme. The fact that the inauguration of Greater New Zealand occurred on the occa- sion of the visit of our future King will ever be a pleasant recollection. Colonel Gudgeon, C.M.G., has been appointed Resident Agent for New Zealand, and the well-being of the in- habitants of the Islands will be our first care, and nothing will be done which will tend to disturb the harmony now existing. In respect to revenues-Customs, Postal, et cetera -- there is no present intention of materi- ally altering the existing conditions. The present revenues enable the Islands to be self-support- ing. Seeing that goods from New Zealand will ultimately be admitted into the Islands free of duty, there will, of course, be a loss of revenue, but this will be more than compensated for by collateral advantages. Mr. Percy Smith has very generously undertaken to go to the Island of Niue for a period of three months, and whilst there he will introduce the new order of things, which we hope will be to the benefit alike of the natives and of the people of this colony. On several of the islands, particularly Pen- rhyn, a Resident Agent will require to be located to see to the interests of the natives, and also to protect the interests of this colony. The cost entailed by the appointment of such Resident Agents will be more than recouped by revenues directly received, so that each of the islands will be self-supporting, and that with- out imposing any direct taxation upon the na- tives. As previously intimated, Parliament will be asked to extend the operations of the Ordi- nances now in force in the Islands pending other provisions being made ; it would not do for the whole of our laws to be enforced in the Islands, for the operation thereof under existing con- ditions would only result in friction and con- fusion. # SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION. In dealing with the many questions neces- sarily involved in placing the Public Accounts before honourable members I have endeavoured to be clear and explicit, not withholding or un- duly extending the information which is neces- sary in order to afford a lucid explanation of the finances of the colony. The Budget proves 
<page:485>
and prosperous, that the operations of last year were satisfactory, and that at the close there was a credit balance of $532,000, that this year there will be a surplus, and that additional taxation is not required, provided the present laws remain unaltered. I trust that I have clearly demonstrated that, with regard to the current year's finances, there was nothing to warrant the alarm and pessi- mistic view which some persons have taken respecting them, and that with care and . economy, notwithstanding the very heavy and exceptional expenses already incurred, it is reasonable to expect there will be a fair surplus on the 31st March next. Presuming, as we do, that the public works expenditure will be fairly up to the estimate, the balance left in the Public Works Fund is likely to be less on the 31st March next than it has been for some years past. It is better that this should be so, and that there should be a tapering-off rather than an increased borrowing as compared with last year. The difficulty in raising money in London has not been without its advantages, for it has taught us that we may with success float loans locally. Under normal conditions a 4-per-cent. rate is too high ; and, although money could be raised at 3 per cent. at Home, the expenses there are so heavy that it would be an advan- tage to us to some extent to raise our money locally at 3} per cent., and to issue debentures over the Treasury counter, or even over the  32106019788246 counters of the colony's banker, so that a per- son could as easily obtain a Government short- dated debenture for $100 as he can put his money in the bank and obtain his receipt    therefor. From what I can gather after making careful inquiries, it is my opinion that next year finan- cial matters will have reached a normal con- dition in the Mother-country, and that there will be a plethora of money easily obtainable at 3 per cent. It must be pleasing to honourable members to know that the elasticity of finance, for which our colony is noted, still continues, and that, notwithstanding the concessions granted last year, our Customs revenue is buoyant, and more than realises expectations. The Customs revenue is the barometer of the spending-power of the people, and also of our prosperity, and the indicator points between " Fair" and " Set fair," whilst the financial meteorologist an- nounces a blue and cloudless sky. In regard to the railways, since the Govern- ment took charge of them in 1895 concessions have been given to the value and extent of $420,000. Eliminating the abnormal traffic created in the mouth of June last, the ordinary traffic shows that there will be increased earn- ings as compared with last year, and, unless unforeseen circumstances arise, the estimated receipts from railways will be fully realised. The settlement of the people on the land is of paramount importance. What we have done, are doing, and must do is to extend our operations and increase the number of our blocks and the bush land easy terms must be given by way of relieving the tenants from pay- ment of rent for the first few years, and also by way of insisting on improvement conditions being complied with ; at the same time afford- ing relief from rent until the tenant is enabled to get his head above water and to pay his way from the produce of the land itself. In respect to gold-mining steady progress is being made. Science has come to the rescue. in regard to quartz-mining, whilst alluvial mining by dredging has assumed large propor- tions. I understand that the yield of gold this year will show a considerable increase over last year. The proclamation of certain rivers is indispensable, and although the first cost may appear heavy, yet this is unavoidable if ground sluicing and dredging are to be maintained. For years past it has been contended and urged that the State should open its coal-mines and be self-supplying. The existing dearth of coal and excessive charges practically forced the position, and, with a good selection and careful administration, there is every reason to believe that the result of a State-owned coal-mine will, as in many other ventures of a progressive cha- racter, prove successful. In respect to industries, however, the horizon is somewhat clouded, but in a short time this cloud will pass away. The employers and em- ployed should shake hands, and both work to- gether for mutual benefit. What will help our industries more than anything else will be to have complete technical and manual instruc- tion for the young of our colony. This educa- tion is being afforded, and the country will be recouped for this expenditure a thousandfold. The increased expenditure to meet the charge necessary to give effect to the scheme for a national and uniform scale of pay for teachers is fully warranted, for in a great measure the future of our colony depends upon the teachers. They have been underpaid in the past, and the remuneration and scale now submitted is fair and reasonable. During the last few years the increase in our public debt may appear out of proportion to the increase in our population and trade; but when it is borne in mind that a very large proportion of this indebtedness is created for the purpose of advancing money to settlers, for the purchase of land for settlements, for loans to local bodies, for land improvement, and for other purposes of a directly reproductive character, there can be no question that splendid security has been given. There is direct local payment of interest, and many collateral advantages fully warrant the credit of the colony being pledged for such purposes. Contrast the wealth of the colony per head of the population with the increased indebtedness, and the most pessimistic individual must admit that the policy pursued has been in the best interests of New Zealand. The construction of roads to the back blocks, the roading of lands prior to settlement, and the endeavour to improve the means of com- munication so as to permit the settlers to

bring their produce to the main roads, and realise, is of paramount importance. The completion at an early date of the North Island Main Trunk Railway, and the coupling together of Auckland and Wellington by a band of steel, is essential and of great im- portance. It will remove existing fears, and give potential advantages by increasing the tourist traffic, by the settlement of the people on the land, and by bringing the settlers in the far North and those in the South closer together for mutual profit and good. This work is national in character, and necessarily in re- spect to railway-construction should take first place. Railways in a young country should be run for the common good and to give encourage- ment to producers, small as well as large. The true principle to be observed is to carry your produce at the lowest possible rates, so as to give the producers an opportunity of competing with the markets of the world ; and to provide cheap fares and freights to convenient markets, so as to obtain revenue from widely distributed areas of settlement. This year, from the cir- cumstances narrated, material reductions in railway freights could not be granted. Next year, and with abnormal expenditure elimi- nated, we hope to grant such concessions as will bring down the net earnings on our rail- ways to 3 per cent. Some honourable members may have mis- givings respecting the large amount asked for defence, but the money spent with this object is only the payment of a premium on an insur- ance. To preserve peace it is wise to be ever prepared for war ; and it is also a duty we owe to the Mother-country and the Empire, as well as to the people of New Zealand, that our able- bodied men should be trained to arms, that our sons should be drilled at school, so as to become efficient members of cadet corps, and ultimately Volunteers, and, when required, as in the caso of our sons in South Africa, to prove them- selves valiant soldiers of the King. I have now detained honourable members a considerable time, and let me say, in con- clusion, that I am sensible of their great and continued confidence. I hope that, although there may be differences of opinion respecting the Budget now submitted, at all events, they will do me the credit of believing that the conclusions have not been arrived at hastily, that the position has been accurately gauged, and that time will prove the finances of this colony to be sound and secure. I advise, and that in good faith, that at the present time the good steamer " Finance " should be steadied, and that " Slow," and not " Full speed ahead," should be the order on the dial. Reasonable care will insure the good ship riding buoyantly and safely in calm and placid waters. The information upon which the present position has been gauged will be placed at the command of honourable members, and I trust that they, with myself, will conscientiously and honestly arrive at the conclusion that our fair colony is prosperous, that there is a bright future before its people, that progress is Mr. Seddon assured, and that, as at present, so in the future, this colony will hold a foremost position as a British dependency. SUPPLY. CLASS I .- LEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENTS. Legislative Council, £1,870. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- I move to report progress. Captain RUSSELL. - Perhaps the right honourable gentleman will, in accordance with the usual custom, tell us the date on which he proposes to commence the debate. Mr. SEDDON .- I propose to proceed with the Financial Statement debate on Friday next, if all goes well ; and I hope to have the Public Works Statement down within a fortnight after the conclusion of the financial debate. It is my intention, as soon as the House resumes, to lay on the table the Appropriation Bill, the Civil List Account, the North Island Expendi- ture Account, the Abstract of Revenue of Pub- lic Account, and the next Gazette will contain the first quarter's returns for the year. An Hon. MEMBER .- Do the papers include B .- 1 ? Mr. SEDDON .- As regards B .- 1, I have made inquiries with regard to what I said the other day, and I am told it is impossible to get it. I do not care one jot, and have no wish or desire to keep back the return, but neither I nor any one else can do impossibilities. But, with the estimates and other work in the Treasury, I am told it is impossible for the return to be pre- pared in the time I was asked to give it in. I cannot do impossibilities, but I will give the necessary year's return, and from these papers honourable members will be in the position of knowing the finances just the same as myself. I beg to move, That progress be reported. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston) .- I would like to ask the Hon. the Premier a question -namely, Whether the accounts he has referred to are to be gazetted in this week's Gazette or next week's Gazette ? Mr. SEDDON .- I am quite prepared to issue -although that is not necessary-a special Gazette ; but, at all events, the information will be in the hands of honourable members before the financial debate commences, so I think the best thing would be to issue them, say, on Tuesday next, and get them circulated. I hope members will be prepared to go on with the debate on Friday, and to let us get on with the business of the country. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- I wish to ask the Premier if he is going to issue the returns for the quarter ending 30th June ? An Hon. MEMBER .- The last quarter's re- turns. Mr. SEDDON .-- The last quarterly returns, which will be the first quarter of this year. Mr. PIRANI .- I should like to point this out to the Premier : The Premier made an insinua- tion just now that members opposite knew more about the Public Accounts than he did, because several of us laughed when he said it was impossible to get the B .- 1 statement ready. 
<page:487>
which occurred before the Public Accounts Committee last year. Evidence was then given that the B .- 1 paper would be ready to print in the middle of June, and the Govern- ment Printer said if he were given a fortnight from that he could have it ready to lay on the table. That was what I had in my mind ; and I say this : that the cause might be the large amount of printing owing to these Royal Commissions, which are neither of use nor ornament, and which have been to a great extent blocking the printing-office; but, so far as the Treasury is concerned, the evidence given by their officers to the Committee was that it was possible to have the B .- 1 statement ready long before the present time. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- I can only say, in answer to inquiries as to when the B .- 1 paper will be available, that when I made inquiries with a view to placing information before the House I was informed that it was an impossi- bility, and therefore, I say, what is the use of my allowing honourable members to believe that I can get done that which cannot be done ? It is quite true that on the occasion mentioned by the honourable member, and on . a previous year, the B .- 1 statement was ready. I say now that the circumstances are entirely exceptional this year, and both the Government and members must wait. We were for a month before the House met, as members are aware, away from the public business, and I think myself and my colleagues ought to have some credit for the manner in which the business of the country has been placed before the House as it has been this session. I shall give the B .- 1 statement as soon as possible, but I do not think I can possibly have it ready for this debate. I am quite prepared to furnish all the papers that are necessary in order that members may understand the finances of the colony and be able to debate the Budget intelligently. Motion agreed to, and progress reported. The House adjourned at twenty-five minutes to eleven o'clock p.m. LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. Tuesday, 20th August, 1901. Bicyclists in Parliament Grounds - Presbyterian Church of New Zealand Bill-Land for Settle- ments Act-Shops and Offices Bill. The Hon. the SPEAKER took the chair at half- past two o'clock p.m. PRAYERS. BICYCLISTS IN PARLIAMENT GROUNDS. The Hon. Mr. ORMOND wished to ask the Hon. the Speaker, If it was possible to take any steps to prevent cyclists passing through Parlia- ment Ground at a fast pace. When he was en- tering the ground that afternoon by the Museum Street entrance, a cyclist ran into him and knocked him down, with the result that his leg cyclist went head-over-heels on to the road. He thought some steps should be taken to prevent such a nuisance existing on the premises. Some by-law should be passed or some order should be given that cyclists were not to go through the premises at a fast pace. The cyclist of whom he complained was going at a fast rate and knocked him down, and went himself right into the middle of the road. The Hon. the SPEAKER said he would in- quire into the matter, and see what steps could be taken. # PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH OF NEW ZEALAND BILL. The Hon. Mr. McLEAN .- Sir, this is a Bill that is necessary on account of the union of the Presbyterlan Churches of New Zealand. It is their unanimous wish that the Presby- terian Church of Otago should retain the management of the property they now hold. I would like to tell members that this property has been administered in the past without any reproach to any one, it has been well conducted, and part of the property maintains three chairs in the Otago University. It would be impos- sible for them to put that property into the Union, and it has therefore been unanimously agreed that they shall administer the property in the future as they have done in the past. There is no opposition to the Bill-it is a private measure-and I shall be very glad to give to members any other explanation that it may be in my power to give. I move the second read- ing of the Bill. Bill read the second time. LAND FOR SETTLEMENTS ACT. The Hon. Mr. ORMOND moved, That there be laid on the table of the Council a return showing,-(1.) All land purchased under autho- rity of " The Land for Settlements Act, 1894," and handed over to the Lands Department, giving the acreage of each block, and the cost, including all expenses in acquiring the same. (2.) How such lands have been disposed of, giving a separate return for each block, such return to show how the lands have been classi- fied-that is to say, if a block has been divided into several classes the return shall give the acreage classed as agricultural land, second- class land, third-class land ; also, the acreage devoted to providing homes for workmen in the vicinity of cities or towns ; the acreage disposed of as small grazing-runs, the number of sec- tions into which each block has been divided, the acreage of the sections, and the rentals ; also, a return of advances made to settlers in each block under the authority of the Land for Settlements Act. The return to show the cost to the colony of each block, including surveys, roading, and all expenses to date of disposal, and the gross rental at which such blocks have been disposed of. Wher. he gave notice of this motion some weeks ago the Land for Settlements Amendment Bill was in another place, and he had hoped the information he wanted before the Bill reached 
<page:488>
members to consider it before the Bill came on. The adjournment of the Council interfered with his motion coming on, and in the mean- time the Bill passed the other branch of the Legislature, and had since also passed the Council. He thought it was matter for regret that Parliament did not have full information as to the working of this very important Act before the measure was disposed of. He did not say there was anything in the return that would affect the measure very much ; but, at any rate, it would have enabled members to study the subject and see how the Land for Settlements Act was being administered and how it was working in the colony, and to bring to the consideration of the matter in- formation which at present was not in the hands of either members or the people of the colony. He thought that, although the Act was passed, it was necessary that the colony should have very full information as to the way in which this important Act was being administered. He might say, in passing, that Parliament ought to have had laid before it, within fourteen days days of opening, a full return as required by Act of the working of the Land for Settlements Act during the past year. Another return showing how the Crown lands had been disposed of should also have been pre- sented, but as yet neither of these returns was available for honourable members, although Parliament had been fifty days in session, and those returns were required fifteen days and twenty days respectively from the beginning of  32106019788246 cach session. Parliament was at present with- out any information as to the working of these very important Acts during the past year ; and if in what he was about to say he was incorrect    in any of his premises, it was only because he had not had an opportunity of availing himself of the information which those returns would have given as to what had been done during the past year. It was a matter for regret that these returns had not been laid on the table as required by law. It was a default that ought not to occur again. It was impossible to do justice to an important subject like this, unless they had full and com- plete information as to its working when Par- liament was dealing with it. The cost of the return, he thought, would not be great. The motion spoke for itself. He desired to have a return of all land purchased under authority of the Land for Settlements Act of 1894, and that such a return should show clearly the different classes of land acquired. He had followed the classification named in the Act, so as not to have a conflict in this respect in any return that might be furnished. That Act defined lands as: (1) Agricultural, (2) second-class, (3) third-class, grazing-runs, and so on ; and in a return it was desirable that that classification should be followed under which the lands had been acquired. When the Act of 1894 was passed many honourable members who were now in the Chamber were here, and others were in the other branch of the Legislature ; and he ven- tured to think that all would agree with him Hon. Mr. Ormond the debates when it was adopted, they would find that Parliament originally determined that the Act was necessary for the purpose of providing land for close settlement. That was the great justification for asking for an an approriation of large sums yearly under the Act, and, as he said, the principal object Parlia- ment had was close settlement of the land. He was entirely in favour of the Land for Settle- ments Act when it was passed, and with others in the Council had taken part in amending it from being, as it was when brought down, & crude, imperfect, and unworkable measure, and making it useful. His honourable friend who sat behind him, the Hon. Mr. McLean, was one of those who also took a very active part in that direction. The object of Parliament was, as he had said, to secure close settlement, and in 1996 Parliament went further. It had then become apparent that sufficient provision had not been made in the original Act for close settlement of another kind-namely, workmen's homes-and that was provided for in the Act of 1896. He asked the Council to follow him in agreeing that the objects of passing the Land for Settle- ments Act were close settlement : under the first Act, general settlement, which was in- tended to be largely agricultural ; and in the second place, the very important provision for workmen's homes in the neighbourhood of cities and towns. No one could deny these objects were such as did credit to the colony. And we knew now than in older countries, even in England, homes for workmen were being largely promoted, with benefit to a class of workmen-mechanics and artizans who were living in the neighbourhood of the towns. He had endeavoured, so far as he was able, to get from the returns which were at the service of honourable members how this Act had been working in New Zealand, and he was obliged to say that he was very much disappointed. The Act was not being worked as it ought to be, he thought, for the benefit of the persons for whom it was passed. It was very difficult for any one without studying these returns to get at what proportion of the lands, which had been purchased for settlement, were agricul- tural land to be used for agricultural purposes or for close settlement ; and the returns, so far as they had been given, of what had hitherto been done in respect to workmens' homes were exceedingly disappointing. Very little had been done in that very important direc- tion-that direction in which he thought there was very large scope in the colony, and to which Parliament, he thought, intended a considerable proportion of the moneys which had been duly appropriated for that pur- pose should be devoted, and that must be disappointing to those who wished to see this Act carried out for the benefit of the people of the colony. The result of his inquiry therefore was that, on the whole, quite a minor proportion of the settlement which had taken place under the Land for Settlements Act had been on that class of land which Parliament meant should be the chief object on which the money should be 
<page:489>
agricultural land. He knew that there were some very successful settlements in the South. He did not know the name of one property-he thought it was bought from Mr. Allan McLean -and that property, he believed, had proved everything that was desired, and that was the close settlement he thought Parliament meant should be largely instituted under the grants which were made. But his study of the ques- tion, so far as he had been able to follow the information given in the returns, was that a very large proportion of the money which had been spent on acquiring land for settlements had been devoted to the acquisition of sheep- farms; and he was one who thought that Parlia- ment never meant, when it appropriated these moneys for the purposes of close settlement, that settlement of a kind which could not be called close was to occupy the chief place, and that the moneys which were being yearly spent on land for settlements were not intended to be devoted to providing sheep-runs for a very limited number of people in the colony. That was his opinion, and why he said this subject deserved the consideration of the Legislature, and why it would have been well had the Parliament had before it, before the Bill was passed, such information as would have enabled it to deal with this very important subject, and why he suggested that they should insist upon such amended administration of the Act as would fulfil the objects for which he claimed the Bill was originally contemplated .. He had just stated that he was one of those who were strongly in favour of the Land for Settlements Act when it was first brought in, and so he was ;   but he had always disapproved of what were known as the compulsory clauses. He held that they would work, as they had worked, with great injury to the colony, and he knew that they were even now working with still greater injury to the colony than when they were first started. He held that the compulsory clause was alto- gether unnecessary ; that there were heaps of land then ready to be sold as there was now, and that the effect of this clause would be to unsettle the people, to stop improvements, and in various ways be prejudicial to the best interests of the colony. His contention that the compulsory power was unnecessary was proved, inasmuch as between 1894 and the year before last, when the estate well known as Hatuma was taken, not a property was acquired under the compulsory clause. The Hon. Mr. JONES .- Yes ; the Ardgowan Estate, at Oamaru, which was taken with the concurrence of the company. The Hon. Mr. ORMOND said he was obliged for the illustration, which he had overlooked. There were only two in the whole of that time taken compulsorily, and Hatuma was by far the largest. Well, his opinion was still that the mischief done by the bad influence of this compulsory clause, which was unnecessary, had been infinitely greater than any good that could be derived from it ; and how much worse it was working now than it was at the begin- perty first taken-Hatuma-which he knew very well, and as well probably as anybody in the colony. He said that was a property which, in the interests of the colony ought not to have been taken, and that the colony would sustain a serious loss by the acquisition of that property. That was his opinion ; and he felt satisfied that in the course of a very short time we would see that the price paid for the Hatuma Estate, and the terms on which the Government had been able to dispose of it, were such that the settlers would not be able to pay the rentals they were called upon to pay for that property ; and that, therefore, it would be as undesirable a purchase for them as it was for the Government who bought it. In no sense could Hatuma be spoken of as agricultural land. It was purely pastoral country, badly watered, but a good sheep-run. Now, he had taken out from this little book, describing Hatuma, a few figures to show how in this particular case his representation that the Land for Settlements Act was being worked in the direction of making sheep runs for a few people was being given effect to. He found in this book that the Hatuma Estate contained altogether 25,737 acres. He might say he had no feeling at all in this matter, or in regard to what had taken place. The estate belonged to an absentee, who was not an improving settler. He was only taking this case to show that in his opinion the colony had made a bad bargain, and that it was an undesirable thing to have exercised the power. Now, he found, on going through the list of lots put up at the Hatuma sale, that there were fifteen lots that could be properly described as small sheep- runs, the largest of which was 1,509 acres, and the smallest was 584 acres, the next being 612 and 651 acres, so that of these fifteen lots every one except two was more than a square mile in extent. He wanted to quote that area, because it would convey more clearly to those outside the fact that this could not be regarded as an instance of close settlement of the land. These were estates. He knew from his knowledge of the country that these bigger lots were really the best of the property ; and the smaller sec- tions, although more level land, were inferior to these larger blocks, and that the only people who would get any good out of Hatuma (if anybody did) were those who had these larger sections. And it would be seen at once, when he gave the figures, as follows : 1,509, 1,158, 1,134, 1,217, 716, 774, 878, 701, 584, 782, 676, 612, 651, 704, 926 acres. So that each one of them was a considerable property. An Hon. MEMBER .- How many sections are there altogether ? The Hon. Mr. ORMOND said he had taken out fifteen of the larger sections. Of course there He was only giving were smaller sections. members an instance how far the money which Hatuma cost went towards the purchase of what he said were a class of property which was never intended, from his point of view, by the Land for Settlements Act. These fifteen properties averaged 868 acres apiece. 
<page:490>
the land carry to the acre ? The Hon. Mr. ORMOND said, About one sheep and a half to the acre, he should think. But Hatuma was a place which he had seen many times under varying conditions. It was a badly- watered property, and how the small settlers would get on in dry seasons, any one who knew Hawke's Bay might guess. The price of Ha- tuma, as near as he could get at it, was about £5 4s. an acre. That was without any roading, surveying, or other incidental expenses, which he would not estimate, simply because he did not want to say anything which could not be thoroughly substantiated. But this little book said that roads were to be provided and access given to each section. The whole cost, at $5 per acre-much less than it cost-would be £65,110 for these fifteen sections, and it could easily be seen that providing properties of this kind for very few people was something which was never contemplated by the Land for Settlements Act. That was what he was try- ing to make apparent, not only to the Council but to people of New Zealand outside the Council who would consider this subject, because, in his opinion, what he had stated was never intended by the Land for Settlements Act. As to the rental of Hatuma, he might state that various rentals were given-7s., 6s. an acre, and so on. He estimated that the very lowest rental would be this-that by the time any one of these settlers, small or large, had fenced in his block and stocked it and put the smallest of whares on it, his rental, including  rental to the Government and interest on his money, would be 10s. an acre a year at the very least, and probably it would be more. With wool at present prices it did not need     him to demonstrate that any such rental would be absolutely impossible; and he did not think the colony ought to be in the position of creating a class of tenants on terms which, in the end, it would be impossible for them to comply with, and which would oblige the Government before they had done with them to largely reduce their rentals. He had instanced the case of Hatuma because it showed how the Land for Settlements Act was working in respect to that particular class of property. Since the Hatuma case was settled, action under the compulsory clauses had been largely pressed upon the consideration of the Government, and one property, Forest Gate, had been taken. He would have something to say about that directly. Notices had been given in the case of three others, but no notice had yet appeared in the Gazette with regard to them. None of them were suitable for close settlement. At the present values which the Valuation Department had managed to have placed upon the land in the Hawke's Bay District, he did not believe any of those pro- perties would, if acquired, pay the Govern- ment. In his opinion they would not be safe investments, nor at those values would settlers be able to occupy them profitably. Believing that, he thought it was his duty to place those facts before the public and before future in the settlement of land of the class of Hatuma, it might not be said that the whole position was not clearly put before the land was acquired. As he had already stated, the second block in Hawke's Bay that the Government had taken was a property called Forest Gate, which consisted of about eight thousand acres, and which had belonged to an old settler, Colonel Herrick, who died some time ago. He was an officer of the Colonial Forces, and was actively employed during the Native wars. He was in command of the expedition at Waikare- moana against Te Kooti, and had performed good services for the colony. The estate was not a big one, nor was it of high quality. He left a widow and five children. Three of them were grown up men, whose ages range from twenty-five to thirty years, and there were two daughters. The estate contained a little over eight thousand acres of land, which, in his opinion, was not suitable for close settle- ment. He should say, in fairness, in refer- ence to the Forest Gate property, that when the proprietor, Colonel Herrick, died, he left an executor, who, knowing that the place was not a very good provision for the family, saw his way some two years ago to acquire, as he thought, a better place where those young people could have a better chance of settling. That was, provided he could sell Forest Gate. It was therefore offered to the Government, which declined it, for the reason that the price asked was considered to be too high. The family was very much pleased at that. The widow desired to end her days there. In the meantime the chance of getting the property which it was thought could be acquired out of the money to be got from the Government for Forest Gate was lost. Then, after that, they were served with a notice that the Government had taken the place. In his opinion that was a very harsh proceeding. The family consisted of, as he had said, five young people and a widow. The property was extremely moderate in size, and it would not provide for more than double the number if it were cut up into pieces which it would be profitable to occupy. Why the Board thought it necessary to be so harsh and arbitrary as to take a small property of this kind from a family who had been born and brought up on it, it was very difficult to say. There was a very strong feeling in Hawke's Bay that this was a cruel and wanton act, and it was generally thought to be one which ought not to proceed further. However, there it was. Notice had been given that the land was taken, and the young people had no other place to go to. This was the return an old settler who had done good service to the colony met with, under the compulsory clauses of the Act. The case, however, was not yet settled, as it had to go to the Court to decide as to what the Govern- ment had to pay, and if it had to pay in the same proportion as it had done in the case of Hatuma, he ventured to say this place would be an equally bad bargain. In regard to the other two properties, there had been no notification of their having been taken, except a statement 
<page:491>
that they were to be taken. One was a pro- perty belonging to an absentee, and the other the case of a very old settler in Hawke's Bay named Rathbone, whose property was not more than five or six thousand acres. Neither of the properties contained much agri- cultural land, but were pastoral country; and he held that it was never intended that this Act should be worked in such a way that the ·Government could give risky prices for pro- perties of that sort. He might tell the Council that, since the Hatuma Estate had been taken over, there had been very strong feeling through- out Hawke's Bay in every little settlement and township, that they would like, as the people near Hatuma had liked, to have places sub- divided ; and in many little towns meetings had been held at which the storekeepers and residents passed resolutions declaring that they desired that such-and-such a place should be taken. This sort of thing was promoted by the compulsory clauses of the Act. He would like to tell a little story, which was perfectly true, about something which took place at one of those meetings not very long ago. At this meeting it was resolved that property " A " should be taken. This was rather a good place near the township, owned by two old gentle- men who had been there a large part of their lives, and who would soon, in the ordinary course of events, be departing this life, and, when they did, no doubt the land would be cut up in the ordinary course ; but that was not soon enough, so the land had to be taken. Then, some persons who resided in another part of the same little township said, " That is all very well, but there is another property near here we would like taken," and a resolution was proposed to move the Government to take that also forthwith. But a man present got up and said, " Stop ; this is a very unwise proceeding. These settlers who own this property are spend- ing large sums of money, and are improving their property. They have been very useful to the township for the last few years. This pear is not ripe. Let them go on and spend more money on improvements, and when the property is ready then it will be ripe to take." There was a nice sentiment! And that was the sort of sentiment that was being promoted by the compulsory clauses of the Land for Settlements Act. "Naboth's vineyard " was a very poor story compared to that. They had all heard about " Naboth's vineyard," but, in his opinion, this beat it a long way. He had said, perhaps, all he desired to say in endeavouring to show-so far as the information at the disposal of Parlia- ment enabled him-that the Act was not being worked to the best advantage of the colony. A study of the various properties that had been acquired would show that a very large propor- tion consisted of pastoral land pure and simple. This was never intended by the Act ; there was plenty of good agricultural land to be got on which the class of settlement desired could be carried out. He also urged that the provisions of the Act which were provided to enable homes to be procured for workmen were not being taken proper advantage of. Very little was being done in this direction. If he erred in his facts it was not his fault ; it was the fault of the Government not providing proper informa- tion to enable him to collect statistics. Had it not been for that he would have placed statistics before the Council to bear out what he was saying ; and if he got the return he was asking for he would make it his business to see that the figures should be made public, so that the people might see how the administration of the Act was going on. As a supporter of, and as one who believed in the usefulness of the land- for-settlement policy, if properly worked, he very much regretted to think it had not been used to the advantage of the colony. The information he had given would enable the Council, and others outside the Council, to judge how far his contentions were correct. But there was one thing in connection with the Land for Settlements Act he ought to mention, because he believed in the freehold tenure. His firm conviction was that, as the operation of the Land for Settlements Act extended-as it would doubtless extend-it would Jargely increase the number of persons holding lands under the Crown under leasehold ; and the day was not far distant when they would say, " We will have the freehold." That day was fast coming on, and the proper adminis- tration of the Act would create a large class of people in the country settled on the land as leaseholders, who only wanted to be numerous to put down this wretched system of leasehold, and insist on having a freehold. That would be the outcome of the Land for Settlements Act. He hoped the Council would agree to give the return he asked for. The information he asked for was information the Council and the colony was entitled to. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER said they had just listened to a very extraordinary speech, because he did not believe such a speech had ever been delivered by an honourable gentle- man coming from any other part of the colony. The strange thing was that he came from the part of the colony where the Act was required, absolutely, to assist the district through its troubles - that was a district where the popula- tion had been stagnant for years, where the capital town was being strangled by outside towns, and where the trade and commerce and population were at a standstill because of the large amount of land held in a few hands. The great difficulty the Government felt was to get into this district, and open it up, because they had received no assistance from the people who owned the lands, or from the public spirit of the district. The honourable gentleman had made an indictment against certain villages and towns that were bold enough to hold public meetings, with a view of asking the Govern- ment that certain properties be purchased for close settlement. Well, was there anything wrong in that? He (Mr. Walker) would have thought from the necessities of the district, and certainly from the exceedingly well expressed sentiments of the honourable gentleman himself as regarded the propriety of close settlement, that 
<page:492>
he would have been very glad indeed that occa- sion should be taken at these meetings to bring these properties before the notice of the Land Purchase Board. The fact was that, in this district, it had been exceedingly difficult to get hold of properties that were available for purchase ; and there had also been a certain amount of difficulty because the country was broken and rolling in its nature, and if the Government took a large property it was neces- sary there should be a certain amount of pas- toral country in it. However, taking the honourable gentleman's statement about Ha- tuma, let them suppose it was cut up into thirty holdings. Was it not better that it should be cut up than that it should remain in its old state ? When the honourable gentle- man talked in a grandiloquent way about the enormous estates the Act is creating on the Hatuma Estate-900 acres, 1,200 acres, and 1.500 acres of land that would only carry a sheep and a half to the acre-did honourable members not wonder at the honourable gentle- man's own moderation in what he had done himself in that direction ? If the honourable gentleman could only bring himself to the state of mind of-he thought-Warren Hastings, or Lord Clive, when he was brought before a great tribunal, and was charged with certain things -of course they charged the honourable gentle- man in a Pickwickian sense with being a large landowner-he would likely be able to say he was astonished at his own moderation. All these properties were a monument to the acquirer's personal moderation. Nobody blamed the honourable gentleman or anybody else in Hawke's Bay for having acquired these estates. All that was said was, that the time had come when they must try to break them up for the purpose of assisting that district to progress. Let them compare that district with any other district in the North Island during the last ten years. Let them compare it with Taranaki, and where did they find in any one district a more miraculous illustration, not only of settle- ment but also of good trade, than they would find in Taranaki ? And where would they find the opposite of this steady progress more than in Hawke's Bay? There was the difference of pole from pole between the two places, and the reason was that Hawke's Bay was a district of large estates and Taranaki was a district of small estates. As far as the natural advantages went, it was true Taranaki had the natural ad- vantage of having a marvellous growth of grass, and the consequent production of dairy pro- duce. Hawke's Bay, on the other hand, was a dry climate ; but still it was a climate that had many possibilities, a climate that, in his opinion, lent itself very reasonably and favour- ably to a great number of small cultures. He was certain that in Hawke's Bay they could have a larger variety of small cultures than in Taranaki, because the wet climate naturally limited the range of production. He did not understand, taking a general view of the subject, that the honourable gentleman was at all justified in making the charges he had made against the policy of the Land for Settle- Hon. Mr. W. C. Walker ments Act or its administration. Of course, if the honourable gentleman had taken a wider view of the subject, and had been able to show that in other parts of the colony the same objection could be taken to the administration of the Act as he contended existed in Hawke's Bay, they might have been able to listen to him with more conviction. For instance, he evidently imagined that the administration of the Act in Hawke's Bay was not only typical, but was the solitary instance of the land- for-settlements administration, because he was not aware of any other estate except Hatuma that had been taken over for settlement. He could assure the honourable gentleman that the difficulties in the way of helping Hawke's Bay had been enormous, and not the least assistance towards helping Hawke's Bay would come through the Land for Settlements Act. The honourable gentleman complained that, because of the high range of the land- values in Hawke's Bay, it would be im- possible for the Government to acquire land there under these values at anything like a reasonable price. Well, the strange thing was that for years valuers had been absolutely under-estimating the value of property in that district, and if conscience-money was pro- curable from the landowners of Hawke's Bay. he believed they would pay a very handsome sum indeed to the Treasury at once. It was impossible that these values could be so extreme ; because they had been low for so long it had been impossible to bring them up to their true value. One of the greatest difficulties the Government had been labouring under, as regarded land-taxation, was that in certain districts, owing to the imperfect machinery, the valuers had not brought the land-values there up to anything like their proper level ; because the essence of true valuation was that there should be one standard of value- an even standard of value-all over the colony. It was very wrong for a Wellington settler who held land to have to pay at a high rate ; while if you went across the border and got- into Hawke's Bay the man who owned similar land was only valued at one-half or two-thirds the value. But those were the sort of anoma- lies which seemed to grow with a certain amount of indigenous vigour in the soil of Hawke's Bay, where the values had been most untrustworthy ; and if the honourable gentle- man now complained that the values were being raised too high, he (Mr. Walker) was only too glad to hear it, because he believed it showed that the values now were being put at something like what they ought to be. He knew they had not been so in the past. Values now in Hawke's Bay were reaching the level of what other parts of the colony had reached long ago, and therefore the landowners in Hawke's Bay were just beginning to pay the same taxes on land that other landowners were paying five years ago. Of course, it was very easy to talk about Naboth's vineyard, and to complain of the compulsory clauses having brought this modern sentiment into certain localities, but the Act had served the policy 
<page:493>
the land was wanted for general purposes the Act said that the owners must retire on compensa- tion. Where was the hardship ? Where was the iniquity of teaching this doctrine of Naboth's vineyard ? As far as he remembered the story of Naboth's vineyard, it was the big man who wanted to eat out the little man. Now, appa- rently, the story was reversed, and the honour- able gentleman tried to apply the parable to the little man trying to eat out the big man, which was quite different. The big man could not complain, especially as modern sentiment went beyond Biblical doctrine in some respects, and had absolutely affirmed the principle that, for the good of the State and for the good of the community, there was no sacredness in the private tenure of land if the land were wanted for public purposes. The tenure of land was the purest fiction that the ingenuity of man had ever invented, and, of course, it was being made sacred by means of statutes of Parlia- ment. But still all that was necessary was to train up a population to prefer one tenure over another, and the whole thing remains exactly the same. No man could take that land away with him to his grave. He did not require any more when he was dead than his 6 ft. of earth. He could not take away anything more. The land remained, and the land must remain for the good of the country, and all the tenant and all the occupier had to consider was, "Can I occupy a piece of land on a sound good tenure ?" and if honourable gentlemen read up the history of land tenure they would find that the freehold was by no means such an antiquated and vener- able kind of tenure as some of them seemed to think. He was quite certain that in England thirty years ago the freehold was hardly recog- nised as a legal term as to the title of land. It was more a title which had grown up since the colonies had sprung into existence, and after they had had proper Land Transfer Acts passed, and where it had been conveyed direct to the individual from the Crown in the individual's lifetime. But as far as the individual occupier was concerned, he contended that he was just as much able to enjoy the profits and the com- pensation from his piece of land under a per- petual lease as he was under a freehold tenure, and there was no reason on earth why a popula- tion should not grow up with sentiments quite contrary to the honourable gentleman's expec- tation and prophecy. There was no reason why the next generation of people in New Zealand should not grow up absolutely con- tented with the leasehold tenure, and who would refuse if they were asked to go back to the servitude of the freehold tenure. Be- cause, what was the feehold tenure ? It simply gave the opportunity to this man or the other man, or to their sons, to squander and mortgage the property, and to allow it to go away from the family. The old Jews in their Mosaic laws dealt very jealously with all these problems, and specially with regard to this matter of alienating the family lands. They did not allow them to go away from the family for ever; a man could mortgage them the family at a certain date periodically. So that it was only in this colony, he believed, where there was a certain amount of sentiment tried to be invoked in favour of what was called freehold tenure. He was not at all afraid on the one hand that the change would take place which the honourable gentleman contemplated in regard to public opinion as regards this lease- hold tenure. In fact, he believed that the longer the agricultural population in this colony lived, and the longer they experienced the benefit of the leasehold tenure, they would be all the more satisfied with it, and would re- fuse to go back to what was called the indepen- dence of the freehold. The Hon. Mr. Ormond wanted certain returns. Well, he had a com- plaint in reference to the non-production of those returns, and he admitted that what was a valid complaint was that the returns on this question had not yet been placed on the table. He might assure the honourable gentleman that he was informed by the department that, through the printing-office having been so much overburdened this session with the printing of returns and papers, although these returns had been prepared for a couple of months, they had been unable so far to get them done, but they hoped to do so soon. If the honourable gentle- man would look at the returns of last session he would find that, as regards these lands, they were very full and ample, and he was informed that in this year's returns every particular that he wanted would be found, and therefore he trusted that the Council would, at all events, not ask for further returns until it found that those already supplied were not sufficient. They did not want to ask for unnecessary re- turns which would also be very costly, and he would repeat that, as far as he could see, the returns as given last year and those to be sup- plied this year would give the honourable gentle- man pretty well all the information he wanted. Then, the honourable gentleman referred to workmen's homes. Of course, the honourable gentleman must know that this legislation had been progressive. We had been going on from year to year; we hoped, like the honour- able gentleman, that this policy was going to be a sound one, but we were cautious, like the honourable gentleman, too. We therefore did not step too far in advance until we felt our way, and while we have had workmen's homes in our minds for some years, we found year by year, even though Parliament gave us fresh powers, still these fresh powers were not suffi- cient. If the honourable gentleman would look at last year's Act he would see we were obliged to take fresh powers in order to enable the Government to compulsorily take land for workmen's homes. It was a matter of very great moment that we should have workmen's homes in the neighbourhood of our cities, of the best kind of land, and connected by such means of conveyance as would enable workmen to get back night and morning to and from their work. But that there had not been any- thing done in that direction, as the honourable gentleman stated, was an exaggeration, because 
<page:494>
were being initiated as was found desirable ; but his contention could only point to the fact of the great difficulties that occurred in putting the Act into force in regard to that particu- lar class of, settlement. He did not, for one minute, think that any one, except the honour- able gentleman, thought the Act was mainly intended for that class of settlement, and that class of settlement alone. The Hon. Mr. ORMOND .- Mainly. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER said the honourable gentleman stuck to his guns; he said mainly for that class of settlement. Now, he maintained, as he said before, that it was not only to break up agricultural properties, or to acquire properties near the towns for the purpose of putting workmen on them, that the Act was contemplated. It was to bring a larger number of families into a district, even though it was pastoral country and magnificent estates of nine hundred acres. That was better for the country than that the land should remain locked up in the large estates which had hitherto existed. He did not see any reason why any one should object to this Act, because it had had a wider range than apparently existed in the mind of the honourable gentleman as regarded its pos- sible operation. After all, anybody who had been accustomed to sheep, and who brought it out in figures and talked about a place of nine hundred acres, carrying a sheep and a half to the acre, as a "magnificent estate," almost staggered one. We knew very well that it was just about that number of sheep  where expenses began to run up; and the same man would probably be able to run three times as many sheep for the same expense. But fifteen hundred was not a very big flock - certainly not in the North Island, where the sheep were more neglected and a little more run down than they were in the South Is- land. But he knew that in the South Island fifteen hundred was not a very big flock, and it was an abuse of language to charge Govern- ment with creating large estates in cutting these compulsorily purchased properties into such blocks. He thought the honourable gentleman, in spite of his philosophic manner and treat- ment, still had got a certain amount of "bee in his bonnet." He felt quite certain that if the honourable gentleman would only look at Hawke's Bay as it had been, and as it was, and as it might be, he would recognise in this Act, probably, the salvation of Hawke's Bay. The Hon. Mr. TWOMEY said he had got from the honourable gentleman the book from which the honourable gentleman had quoted, and he found that this Hatuma Estate was now cut up into fifty-eight holdings, ranging from three hundred acres. Now that was a big thing. The average number of people on each was said to be about five for each family, so that if fifty-eight was multiplied by five there would be very near three hundred persons settled on the estate of this very ancient Scotchman, who was an absentee up to a few years ago. Now, in regard to the question of freehold, when they were discussing the Land for Settlements Hon. Mr. W. C. Walker Cheviot settler. He knew him first as a free- holder, but he took a mortgagee in as a partner, and it was a case of the lady of Riga- There was a young lady of Riga Who went for a ride on a tiger; They came back from that ride with the lady inside, And a smile on the face of the tiger. There was a smile on the face of the mortga- gee, and the freeholder left, and when he went to Cheviot he had to borrow the deposit-money, and now he was a man worth thousands. If you talked to that man about the freehold, he would laugh at you. He knew all about it. There was no use in discussing the subject any further. He would like to speak on the free- hold business, but he did not think the time was opportune just now, and he did not feel up to speaking-pitch. He only wanted to state these two facts. The Hon. Mr. McLEAN said the honourable member representing the Government referred to the Hon. Mr. Ormond's speech as an extra- ordinary speech. He thought they might term some portions of the Minister's speech as still more extraordinary. He thought the Hon. Mr. Ormond was endeavouring to show that if the Act was worked in the manner in which it had been worked in Hawke's Bay, then the land- for-settlements policy would come to an end. He took it that it was not for the purpose of providing the people of this country with sheep-runs that that Act was passed, and that was the whole argument of his honourable friend, Mr. Ormond. The honourable gentleman's argument was that only land should be taken in Hawke's Bay that was fit for close settle- ment, and fit for agriculture. He would like to ask what member of the Council would gain- say that argument. Then, to say that there was no better land in Hawke's Bay than they had heard the honourable gentleman describe was, to him, ridiculous. He knew that there were grand plains of fertile land there. Many people had the idea that instead of taking un- suitable lands and borrowing money to pay for them, it would be better to run through the North Island Main Trunk Railway, and settle the lands there that the colony had paid for years ago. That was what many advocated, and not to take large estates that were unsuit- able for close settlement. Every one knew that they could not go on for ever borrowing and borrowing. Many people were of opinion that the freehold must be given in time. Everybody, and every Councillor, knew that it was only a matter of time when they would have to give the freehold again. Freehold was a sentiment that the people wished for, and why should it not be gratified ; and a needy Treasurer coming into power in a fix for money would soon find a way of giving it. He held that they could make laws that people should not have more than a certain amount of land, and if they had any more than the specified amount it would be forfeited to the Crown. Surely that would prevent the aggregation of big estates. Every one knew that when these people wanted the freehold they 
<page:495>
reduced they would have their demand acceded to. Every one in politics knew that there was a certain time when the Government got weak in the House, and when members went to them and said they were pledged to get certain reductions in rent for their constituents, and that they could not go back to them with any hope of get- ting returned without getting those reductions, and that if they did not get them they would have to vote with the Opposition. Every one knew that then the rents would be reduced, otherwise out would go the Government. He was not one of those who believed in big es- tates, and he had never contrived to get them. He had always held that there was no need to take land compulsorily for land-settlement. The people who got their estates taken were the lucky people, in his opinion. An Hon. MEMBER. - What do they growl about ? The Hon. Mr. McLEAN said he did not know any one growling about having had their estates taken from them, except one in Hawke's Bay, and he did not believe he was in earnest. If he had land he would be very glad indeed to have it taken, and he would rejoice with others similarly situated at having got rid of it. If the Tax Department were raising the value of land in Hawke's Bay before Go- vernment took it, surely that was the worse for the colony ; and for his honourable friend to say it was to equalize values all over the colony, was simply ridiculous. Land was valu-  able according to the position it was in, and according to its access to the railways or water carriage, and although people might give $50 an acre in the neighbourhood of Christchurch for land, it did not follow that land in the neighbourhood of Napier would fetch half as much. It would be absurd to compare Taranaki with Hawke's Bay. A great portion of Taranaki had been reclaimed from the bush. Other parts were Native land that had been cut up and sold. He would ask: What about the plains out of Hawera? That was Native land which had been confiscated, he thought, and afterwards cut up into sections, and beauti- ful land it was for the purpose. They could not successfully grow crops, nor breed sheep there, but it was excellent dairying country, and was of considerable benefit to the colony. He did not think any one would hold that the land in Hawke's Bay was suitable for dairying, as the land in Taranaki was. It was, however, suitable for other classes of cultivation. In his opinion, it was very suitable for fruit-growing, and that industry could be worked up there. They could grow crops without any incon- venience there. The difhculty of doing that in Taranaki was that, after even they got them into stook, they started sprouting again, on account of the dampness of the atmosphere. As a consequence dairying was found to be much more profitable there than cropping. To make the excuse for not . supplying the return, that the printing-office was not able to print returns required by statute to be placed before Parliament within a Plenty of matter was being printed in that office that could very well be kept. He thought the resolution should be carried, and if the re- turn was laid on the table and conveyed the information required in the return, he thought his honourable friend would not put them to the inconvenience of compiling or printing it. He thought the return should be ordered. There was one thing regarding land for settle- ments which he would say he had always upheld himself to a certain extent, and that was that it had prevented other people from cutting up pro- perties and selling them. It was only the Govern- ment that could sell or let them, and everybody rushed to the Government, in the hope that some day they would get freehold when wanted, or their rents reduced. If laws were made pre- venting settlers from increasing the size of their properties, then he did not see why they should not have the freehold. He was quite satisfied that some of those estates mentioned should have remained untaken until the railways were sufficiently advanced into their Native lands. on which a large population could be settled. Traffic for the railways could thus have been made, while a large tract of country would have been settled. That would have prevented running up the debt of the colony at a pace which every one must know could not continue. They required something like two millions a year for public works at present, and he did not think it would be long before they saw an end of that boom. He would support the motion for the return. The Hon. Mr. T. KELLY saw no objection to the return asked for by the honourable gentleman. In his opinion the Act had been very beneficial to the colony, and would continue to be so if properly administered. When the Government purchased land from a private individual where it was well situated and suited for the purpose of cultivation, they must, in the terms of the Act, give a good price for it- that was, at least, the market price-and unless the land was of good quality and was easily accessible, the tenant would not be able to pay 5 per cent. on the cost to the Government, besides fencing and building, in order to profit- ably occupy it. Comparison had been made between the land in Hawke's Bay and Taranaki. There could be really no comparison between the two. On the East Coast the climate was a dry one, while on the West Coast in Taranaki there was continual rain and sunshine; and in dealing with lands subject to these different descriptions of climate the class of purpose to which the land was most profitably applied were entirely distinct. In Taranaki, round the base of Mount Egmont, owing to the reliable rainfall, which on an average was 6 in. or 7 in. every month in the year, the most profitable pursuit was dairy - farming. The climatic conditions dominated the class of farming that was most beneficial to the occupier. It meant that they could not hope to grow grain there ; but dairying, on the other hand, could be carried on more cheaply and successfully than in any other part of the world. Hawke's 
<page:496>
be profitably raised there, because the climate and soil suited them ; whereas they could not be so successfully kept in Taranaki. In regard to the statements made by his honourable friend, Mr. Ormond, in regard to small sheep-runs in which a portion of run referred to by him was cut, it appeared to him that, at the present price of wool, land carrying only one sheep and a half to the acre, and with a rent of from 6s. to 8s. per acre, it would be impossible for the tenant to make a living on sheep-farming. But if dairy- ing was possible on such land it was possible to succeed. The hour of four o'clock having arrived, the Council proceeded to the Orders of the day. SHOPS AND OFFICES BILL. IN COMMITTEE.

THOMPSON (Marsden) brought up the report of the Waste Lands Committee on the above petition, asking that the Moa Flat Estate should be acquired by the Government for the purposes of close settlement. They re- ported that the land was not suitable for the purpose, and recommended that the estate be not acquired. Mr. T. MACKENZIE (Waihemo) said that unfortunately he was not present at the Waste Lands Committee when the evidence of Mr. McKerrow was taken on this petition : he had not then returned from the South when the report was submitted. The report was probably quite correct to a point, when it stated that all the estate was not fit for close settlement ; but that the estate was fit for settlement he asserted was beyond a doubt. There was a portion of it unfit for close settlement, and he was quite sure, from what he knew in connection with numbers of farmers in the surrounding districts who had grown-up families, that they wished the estate would be taken up and divided into small grazing-runs and small farms. He was cer- tain if that were done they would be taken up. In connection with this estate, he felt certain that in its present condition it was a bar to progress in that important district. The Government had the power to acquire it, and they could acquire it at a price he was quite certain that would enable them to settle it under proper conditions. If one saw, as numbers had seen, the class of country that was opened up for small grazing-runs in the 
<page:497>
the people who had taken up that country, he was quite sure that the Government could do well with the estate, if acquired at a reasonable price, to secure successful settlement in that particular district. Personally, he was exceed- ingly anxious to see all the country acquired that was fit for occupation by the sons of settlers ; and there were a great number of settlers in that neighbourhood who, he was persuaded, would take up that country and become successful farmers. Of course, as he said at the beginning of his remarks, he agreed with the Committee that it was not all fit for close settlement ; but, taken at a price such as the Government would acquire it at under the Land for Settlements Act, he was quite satis- fied it would be taken up. Motion agreed to. MERRIVALE ESTATE. Mr. GIEFEDDER (Wallace) asked the Go- vernment, If they will favourably consider the advisability of acquiring the remaining portion of the Merrivale Estate for closer settlement ? Part of this estate was purchased some years ago by the Government under the Land for Settlements Act, and settlement in that locality had been fairly successful. Seeing that there was a demand for land in the neighbourhood, and the property was for the most part of fair quality for closer settlement, it was desirable that in the near future the Government would see their way clear to purchase the remainder of that estate. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said that 11.0. there were two blocks on the ori- ginal Merrivale Estate which might still be obtained : the homestead, of 6,290 acres, of which about 2,000 acres was birch forest, on poor land ; the remaining area of about 4,290 acres was considerably broken, and was generally poor fern land. About 1,500 acres had been cul- tivated ; the rest was in the natural state. This block was offered to the Government a few months ago, but the Land Purchase Board did not see its way to recommend the acquisition. There was another block of about 9,000 acres which contained some good river-flat land. It was all open grass country, some of it hilly, but fair soil, and would subdivide well into moderate-sized farms. It was adjacent to the block of 10,000 acres purchased from the same estate about six years ago, and which had since been gradually taken up, and was now a successful settlement. It would be worth while ascertaining if the 9,000 acres could be obtained at a reasonable price. The opening of the Ring- way Estate of 2,300 acres shortly in the Otautau district, about twelve miles from the 9,000 acres, would be a criterion as to what demand there was in the district for land. FIJI. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) asked the Premier, Whether he will lay on the table of the House a copy of the letter addressed by the Hon. Mr. Chamberlain to Sir George O'Brien, Governor of Fiji, dated Downing # VOL. OXVII .- 81. print a copy of the letter, and he thought it only right that it should be laid on the table of the House with the other correspondence that had already been placed on the table. The letter had an important bearing on the question which, he understood, was to be brought under the consideration of Parliament. He understood the right honourable gentleman to say a few days ago that a copy of the letter had been laid on the table of the House, but he had made inquiries from the Clerk, who told him that the letter had not been laid on the table. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said, If the letter was not confidential it would be laid on the table. If it was the one from the Right Hon. Mr. Chamberlain to His Excellency Sir George O'Brien, Governor of Fiji, in which he inferred that there must be some mistake, misappre- hension, or misrepresentation, then there would be no objection, and if the honourable gentle- man could show him a copy of it he would let him know at once. [The honourable gentleman having done this, the Premier replied that the letter would be laid on the table of the House.] Captain RUSSELL .- What correspondence will be laid on the table ? Mr. SEDDON .- All letters from the Secretary of State except those that are confidential. Captain RUSSELL .- I am glad to hear that. Mr. FISHER said he had the letter. In it the Right Hon. Mr. Chamberlain said,- " Unfortunately, however, the language used by you on this occasion was open to miscon- struction, and has been garbled and distorted by Press summaries so as to give umbrage to the Government of New Zealand." Mr. SEDDON said he had already informed the House that all letters from the Secre- tary of State to the Government in respect to that matter, excepting those that were con- fidential, would be laid on the table of the House. MILITARY PENSIONS BOARD. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) asked the Minister of Defence, If any appointments have been made to the Pensions Board under the Military Pen- sions Act ; if so, will he state the duties to be performed, and give the names of appointees ? Since he had put the question on the Order Paper the Gazette had appeared, and the names asked for had been gazetted. He would like, however, to have the additional information. He noticed that the Boards were made up of medical men, some of whom did not belong to the Volunteer Force. Medical offi- cers had been passed over by the appointment of civilians to the Military Pensions Board. The result had been intense dissatisfaction amongst the medical officers, who had served in the various districts for over twenty years. They felt that a slight had been cast upon them, and serious harm would be done to the medical staff if those who had given their services for so long in the past were thus passed over. These 
<page:498>
officers had been doing the work in connection with the Volunteers without pay. They had inspected the men of the contingents when they went away; they had inspected the men on their return; and now they were passed over, and so they naturally felt very much slighted. He noticed a case in Canterbury, for instance, where the senior officer of the district had been passed over and a junior officer had been made chief officer of the Pensions Board, and another who was not a Volunteer officer at all had been appointed to the Board. Similarly in Otago two medical men had been appointed to the Board who were not connected with the Volun- teer Force. Medical men, one of whom had served twenty years and another ten years, had given invaluable services to the Volunteers, but they had been slighted and put on one side. In Auckland a similar thing had taken place. There the chief Volunteer officer had been passed over, and a civilian, who was a medical man, had been appointed to the Board. He feared this was an action that would do serious harm, as it showed the way men were liable to be treated who had given their time and ser- vices to the Volunteer work. He hoped a satis- factory answer could be given. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said there certainly had been no intention on the part of the Government to slight medical men, whether they were Volunteer officers or other- wise. He believed it was necessary to have a mixture, and he had very good reasons for it too. Volunteers and military people did not seem to know everything :  Mr. J. ALLEN .- Why not as much as civi- lian doctors ? Mr. SEDDON said he had his reasons, and the responsibility was his; but no slight what- ever had been intended to the officers. If it could be said that the medical men who had been put upon the Board were not competent to examine into and to report upon the cases, then he would consider the matter of making a change. A doctor might be an excellent sur- geon for Volunteers, but when they desired to have this particular business performed there might be reasons for making a different selec- tion. At all events, he had made as good selec- tions as he could, and it had not been altogether There plain sailing in respect to this matter. was one district in which the medical man had refused- Mr. J. ALLEN .- Because of the insult to a brother officer. Mr. SEDDON said, No; the honourable member was like the little boy-he did not know anything about it. The honourable mem- ber knew absolutely nothing about what he was alluding to. Did he know that the medical men in Wellington had all refused to accept the posi- tion at a guinea a case ; and did he know that three medical men were required to give a man a certificate for a month's leave, and that it cost three guineas, whilst the trooper's pay would only come to £6? The honourable mem- ber was referring to another matter altogether. The honourable member did not know the diffi- culties that had had to be met ; and he might Mr. J. Allen say that if he could not get surgeon-captains he would get others where he could. At all events, in this matter there had been no dis- courtesy intended, and the probability was that the men selected would join the Volunteer corps. # M. D. DINEEN. Mr. LANG (Waikato) asked the Government, If they will place a sum on the estimates for the purpose of giving effect to the recommenda- tion of the Public Petitions A to L Committee of last year on the petition of M. D. Dineen (Petition No. 389), namely : "That the Com- mittee recommend that the petitioner be paid the amount claimed (namely, £18 18s. 4d.) " ? This petition came before the Public Petitions A to L Committee last year. The Committee went very fully and carefully into the case, and heard evidence on both sides. The head of the department was also present. The Committee reported, " That the Committee recommend that the petitioner be paid the amount claimed- namely, $18 18s. 4d." He therefore asked if the Government would give effect to the re. commendation of the Committee. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said there was no fund out of which compensation could be paid. The debit balance of this par- ticular transaction was 3s. 6d. There was a general balance of £4,686 6s. 2d. at credit on account of all lands dealt with by the office under the Act to date. This had to be kept for twenty years before it became Crown property. If Dineen was to be compensated a sum must be placed on the estimates for that purpose. He would again point out that when he first asked for compensation it was for a sum of ES only. In the face of that, the Government did not see their way to go beyond the advice of the Public Trustee. Mr. LANG might be allowed to point out to the Premier that the Public Trustee was present before the Committee, and that the Committee took his evidence, and after hearing what he had to say they recommended the pay- ment of the £18 18s. 4d. The case was too long to go into in the time allowed by the House in asking a question ; but if the Premier looked into the matter he would see that it was a just claim, and he could meet it by putting a sum for the purpose on the supplementary estimates if he wished to do so. Mr. SEDDON said the case had been up before, and his colleague the Colonial Secre- tary had on that occasion said,- " This matter was in the same position as other recommendations from the different Com- mittees. It would be considered with other recommendations, and whatever decision was arrived at would be shown on the supplementary estimates. If the amount was not provided for on the supplementary estimates, it would mean the Government did not think that provision should be made for it." The Government had given it full considera- tion. In cases of this kind they must be guided by the Public Trustee. Any members who saw what was placed before the Petitions Com- 
<page:499>
mittee from the Public Trustee, together with the correspondence, with which he did not want to weary the House, would recognise there was strong reason in support of the course that was being taken. He said if they were to admit claims of this kind, and asked the Government to put votes of public money on the estimates for them, they would be taking up a wrong position. Mr. LANG .- Then, you ignore the report of the Committee. # MASTERTON CADET CORPS AND RIFLE CLUB. Mr. HOGG (Masterton) asked the Minister of Defence, When the applications of the Masterton Cadet Corps and the Masterton Rifle Club to be accepted under the Volunteer He regulations are likely to be dealt with ? would like the Minister of Defence to inform him in what position the applications from the young men who had asked for enrolment under the Volunteer and military regulations were at the present time. From time to time he had been appealed to on the subject by members of the corps in course of formation. They repre- sented that they had written to the Defence Department and were unable to get a reply. This department, he was told, had the services of six staff officers and thirteen clerks, but apparently their work was of such magnitude that they were unable to acknowledge the communications that were sent to them. This was his reason for putting the question on the Order Paper. He had written him-  self to the Minister of Defence, and addressed his letters to the Hon. the Premier, think- ing they would receive attention, but he found very great difficulty in getting any in- formation. With reference to the Masterton Rifle Club, he found he had made a mistake. The name should have been the Opaki Rifle Club ; but he had made the Defence Department aware of the blunder he had inadvertently com- mitted. The club had been in existence for ten years under the name of the North Wairarapa Club, but as some other Wairarapa corps had been formed they considered it advisable to change the name. Mr. SEDDON .- Where are its headquarters ? Mr. HOGG said its headquarters were some seven or eight miles away from Masterton, and the members had no opportunity of joining any Volunteer Corps. They were mostly sons of farmers living out in country districts, and they were exceedingly eligible young men, a number of them being looked upon as our best shots, so that they deserved every possible encourage- ment. On Saturday night twenty-six of them handed in their names, and other names were to be sent in shortly. Though they had made an application prior to the arrival of the Duke and Duchess of York, up to the present time they did not know what had been done with their application. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said the answer he would give the honourable member would apply to all other rifle clubs in the colony. He had refused none, nor did he intend to refuse any so long as they complied with the regulations. When they made application a copy of the regulations was sent to them asking them to reply whether they came within those regulations ; that was to say : (1) Whether they were three miles from the headquarters of a Volunteer corps ; (2) whether their mem- bership was of the number required ; (3) whether they were prepared to comply with the conditions. Now, it would surprise honour- able members when he told them that not 20 per cent. had had the courtesy or had taken the trouble to reply to those questions. That had caused delay. On Saturday last he signed for about twenty rifle clubs ; he did not know whether this was one of them or not. He could only assure the honourable member that if this rifle club replied to the questions put and complied with the regulations he would accept them with pleasure. Then there was another question. Some of these clubs were cadet corps, and those cadet corps attached to the high schools and some of the other schools were under the Defence Department. Well, in his opinion, there should not be divided authority. All these school cadet corps should either be under the Boards of Education or under the Defence Department ; and he was inclined to think, as the Boards had something to do with them, and the school-teachers had a good deal more to do with them, that it would be better if those cadet corps were taken over by the Education Department. However, he had hesitated to do that until he saw that the Education Department was fully prepared to do for those corps what the Defence Department would have to do for them. They would have to see that they were instructed, and that there were regulations and inspection, otherwise the thing would not be a success. At the present time the matter was between the two depart- ments until a decision had been come to as to which should have control. He had given the Committee and members his views on the matter, and he would like to say now that he believed the cadet corps of the colony were of vital im- portance, and it was the intention of the Go- vernment to accept them, and to see that they were properly trained and fairly well encou- raged. RIFLE TEAM FOR BISLEY MEETING. Mr. HOGG (Masterton) asked the Govern- ment, If it is proposed to send a rifle team from New Zealand to compete at the next Bisley meeting in England ? This was a question of a good deal of interest to both rifle clubs and Volunteer corps in New Zealand. On the last occasion when a team from New Zealand com- peted at a similar meeting he believed they gave a very good account of themselves, and one of them was very nearly carrying off one of the principal honours. The rifle-men in his district were anxious to know whether a similar opportunity would be given again. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said he was pre- pared to give this matter the very fullest con- sideration. No application had yet been made by the Rifle Association, but probably, if it was 
<page:500>
place a sum of money on the supplementary estimates, and the House could decide whether a team should go. He believed in encouraging rifle associations, and that the colony should be represented, but he must leave it for the House to determine. He might say to the honourable member that he had rung up the department about the Opaki Rifle Club, and could now say that that was one of the clubs that had sent in no return. ENCOURAGING POPULATION. Mr. O'MEARA (Pahiatua) asked the Pre- mier, If he will introduce a measure granting relief, either by a monetary or a land grant, to parents who have six children or more, and so encourage the increase of population in our colony ? He hoped the Government would re- cognise the necessity of doing something in this matter. If honourable members would refer to the Budget, at page 10 they would find a para- graph stating that the population of the colony from 1891 to 1896 had actually decreased by 7,366 persons, which affected the prosperity of the colony. In his own district there were many struggling settlers who had large families, and the men were desirous of getting on to the land, but who, owing to the peculiarity of the present ballot system, were unable to do so. He thought if the Government would intro- duce a measure giving those who had six children and over an opportunity of settling on the land, they would be doing a good work for the colony. If honourable members would refer to the cost of immigration, they would find that from the inception of the immigration scheme it had cost this colony £2,147,718 16s. 4d. Now, if the Government would give a grant of land of a hundred or two hundred acres to those men who have families of six and over the cost would be infinitesimal compared with the cost of immigration. If it was impossible to do what he urged in the way of a land grant, he would suggest that the Government should propose a monetary grant to be paid every year to parents of such families as he had described. He thought that some consideration should be given to these people, and, as the matter was important, he hoped the Government would give it atten- tion. The legislation proposed by the Premier would not have the desired effect, and a private member could not introduce a measure inter- fering with the revenue of the Crown without the permission of the Government. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said the honourable member had failed in the main essential. It was for him to have proved that the giving of monetary aid or land would have the effect of causing an increase in the population. If a monetary grant or a piece of land would change the position, he thought they should have more families. He did not know why the honourable member had fixed the arbitrary number at six. He had no doubt that the honourable member was fully conversant with the game of under and over seven, and he did not understand why he had fixed the number at six. Personally, he had always believed that there was luck in odd Mr. Seddon not think they should cast a slight on the colony. A family of six was nothing. If the honourable member had said a dozen he could have understood him, because it was a struggle for the head of the family to maintain such a large number. But he certainly would not offer a premium in the case of a family of six. An Hon. MEMBER .- Six is above the aver- age. Mr. SEDDON said that, of course, showed that the people who had only six children did not appreciate the joy of a large family. There was nothing created so much happiness as hav- ing a large family around one. He believed there were cases where they might render some assistance. When he wanted to give preference to married men under the Land for Settlements Bill objection was taken to that by some mem- bers. Those members were inconsistent, be- cause one day they refused to give preference to married men taking up land, and the next day they asked that a premium should be given in the case of a family of six children. He could not accede to the request. Mr. O'MEARA said he made no objection to preference being given to married men, and he could not understand the Premier making such a statement. Mr. SEDDON said, When the Land for Settle- ments Bill was brought in it contained a pro- vision that preference should be given to married men to go on the land. He understood the honourable member was one of those who ob- jected to that. If he had done the honourable member an injustice he regretted it. If mem- bers had changed their minds he might probably reintroduce the provision. Mr. O'MEARA said the Premier had made an inaccurate statement with respect to him (Mr. O'Meara), and he expected the honourable gentleman to withdraw it. Mr. SEDDON said he would be most happy. He was very glad to find that the honourable member was converted. RETURNED TROOPERS. Mr. A. L. D. FRASER (Napier) asked the Minister of Defence, What is the cause of the delay in payment to returned troopers of money due to them for services in South Africa ? Since placing this question on the Order Paper the matter had been dealt with in the Budget. It was, however, a subject of considerable im- portance. He had received a number of com- munications from young men who had returned from South Africa some six weeks ago, and they had not yet received what money was due to them. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) could only repeat that the Government had done all that was possible in this matter. As soon as certificates were issued the money was paid. The Government had advanced and were ad- vancing money to the men pending their accounts being made up. The departmental reply was as follows :- "The Fourth and Fifth Contingents, which are under Imperial pay, are having their ac- 
<page:501>
present moment, and as soon as money is re- ceived from the War Office, as promised by them, the men will be paid as soon as possible ; but they all receive advances when asked for if so entitled. The complete settlement of ac- counts of the first three contingents is being made as rapidly as it is possible to do so." He could not do any more. He believed the accounts were about finished now. The Go- vernment were not either refusing advances or delaying matters; but the accounts must be made up in order to ascertain what was due to the men. Complication had arisen owing to the state of things when the men left South Africa. It was not the fault of the Govern- ment. # GOVERNMENT WORKS IN HAWKE'S BAY. Mr. A. L. D. FRASER (Napier) asked the Minister of Labour, If he will explain why men have been brought from the South Island for employment on Government works in Hawke's Bay when local men are idle, and overlooked ? No doubt it might be said that the obvious answer to this question was that where there was labour for the men it was immaterial where the men were brought from. As a fundamental principle, no doubt that was correct ; but he did say it was wrong for the Government to bring men from the South Island and place them on the Hatuma Estate when there were men idle in Hawke's Bay. Only three or four days ago the Mayor of Napier had to call a  meeting of the unemployed, and their chief grievance was this : that, although there was work at their doors, some one with influence or power had brought seven men up from Oamaru and had them placed on the Hatuma Estate roads. That was manifestly unjust, and no doubt the Premier would agree with him that it was wrong. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Labour) said half a dozen men were taken from Oamaru and sent to the Government works in Hawke's Bay. The men referred to by the honourable gentleman were out of work in May last, and, as there was no Government work available in the vicinity from which they came, it was the duty of the Government to endeavour to give them work in other parts of the colony if it was available, and as there was work to be done in the Hawke's Bay District, and no complaint had been received that men were idle there, they were placed on road- works in the Hatuma Estate. The bulk of this work was, however, only suitable for plough and scoop, and, as it was understood that the local men referred to by the honourable member were principally small farmers with teams, they would have an opportunity of participating in the work when the proper time arrived. As to the meeting of the unemployed at Napier, he thought the honourable member should be the last to give prominence to the fact that Napier was in a worse position than other parts of the colony. What had been reported to him (Mr. Seddon) by the Chief Clerk in the Labour De- partment on the matter was this :- " About thirty assembled in answer to ad- vertisement, some mere youths, many elderly men, and not up to labourers' requirements. Few of them would be employed by any con- tractor. Not more than ten could be regarded as able-bodied. Some were the usual derelicts. Have shown this to the Mayor, who concurs." That was shown to the Mayor, who concurred in it ; and if that was the state of Napier, then all he (Mr. Seddon) had to say was that Napier was well off. He would indeed be sorry to know that things were otherwise. If the " un- employed " difficulty was felt in an acute form it would not require an advertisement to call the men together, so that it was rather satis- factory to know that things were as they were. No doubt there were some people out of work in the district, and he would not be surprised to know that the trouble was caused by the existence of large landed estates in the district. Mr. A. L. D. FRASER said that what the Premier had stated with regard to the personnel of the meeting was practically correct, because he had received a telegram from the Mayor to the same effect. The meeting was called in his (Mr. Fraser's) absence, but he had no doubt from the information he had received that there were at the meeting several young able-bodied men who were out of work at the time, and who were, of course, anxious to get something to do. It came back, however, to what he considered was a wrong principle-namely, that where men had their names on the books of one district, others should not be brought to that district from somewhere else to fill the vacancies. Mr. SEDDON said he would do the same thing again. If there were only five or six able- bodied men out of work in Napier, for a few days, and other men had been out of work since May last, he did not care where they came from, the longest out of work should have the preference of any work. AMMUNITION FOR .303 RIFLES. Mr. COLLINS (Christchurch City) asked the Premier, What steps the Government have taken with regard to supplying ammunition for the new .303 rifle with which the Volunteers have been furnished ? Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said this rifle took the same ammunition as the Martini-Enfield, and was being supplied under contract with the Colonial Ammunition Company. Mr. COLLINS said his object in asking the question was this : He had anticipated a reply in the nature of that given by the right honour- able gentleman, and he wanted to draw attention to the fact that the source of the supply of ammunition in New Zealand-he did not find a single fault with the source of supply-was a manufactory situated in the City of Auckland, and he (Mr. Collins) said it seemed to him that the supply of arms and ammunition should come from some point less open to attack than a coastal town. The lessons learned in South Africa should teach us the advantage of having supplies of ammunition from some point little 
<page:502>
open to attack and easily get-at-able in case of necessity. Mr. SEDDON said, Mount Cook was invul- nerable, but he did not think it was possible to put an ammunition factory on the top of it. # WOODVILLE REFRESHMENT-ROOMS SCANDAL. Mr. O'MEARA ( Pahiatua) asked the Minister of Defence, If he will extend the scope of in- quiry of the Military Commission now sitting to the railway refreshment-room scandal at Wood- ville ? The allegations that had been made in respect to this matter had been absolutely denied in the House, and he thought it would be only fair to those who made them that justice should be done and an inquiry held. He felt perfectly confident that the charges made at the time by the ex-Mayor of Woodville and himself were practically correct in every detail. When he had asked a question on the subject previously the Premier promised that he would lay the papers on the table. Why had this not been done ? It would be not only fair to himself, but to the young ladies who made the allegations, and whose evidence was taken at Woodville, that the papers should be laid on the table so that they might be cleared from the charge of making false representations. He thought the officer in charge, Lieut .- Colonel Watt, should be asked for an explanation of his conduct. In his opinion, that gentle- man had never moved from his place at all during the whole of the disgraceful scene. He hoped the Premier would enlarge the scope of the present Commission so that further in- quiries could be made into the charges, so that the Government might be cleared from the suspicion of having no desire to make a full and satisfactory inquiry. He hoped the Minister would agree to this proposal for his own sake. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said he had stated before that, in his opinion, there were good reasons why the papers should not be laid on the table. He had no objection to the honourable gentleman seeing the papers, but nothing should be done which was calculated to bring discredit on Volunteers or the Volun- teer movement, more particularly when they did not know who were the delinquents. It would be casting a slur on every Volunteer corps and every Volunteer who had come from the West Coast on that occasion. He believed the girls, and he believed there had been an insult, and also that- whether in joke or other- wise-some things had been taken away. But honourable members knew as well as he did that, whether for business or other reasons, the restaurant-keeper was satisfied, and did not wish the matter reopened. He did not himself wish to publish through the Press anything that would bring discredit on the Volunteers. Mr. O'MEARA thought that, if it could be shown that the colonel had neglected his duty, he should be dismissed. Mr. SEDDON said that was another phase of the question ; but the Commission had con- cluded its labours, and he could not refer the matter to them. Mr. Collins # AUCKLAND DRILLSHED. Mr. FOWLDS (Auckland City) asked the Minister of Defence. When he hopes to have a new drillshed erected at Auckland ? Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said the plans had not yet been completed, but would. be shortly submitted. He thought the cost would be about $3,000, at which the Govern- ment would erect the drillshed on the old site. It showed the necessity for the State to insure its properties. # MR. CROSS'S PROPERTY. Mr. O'MEARA (Pahiatua) asked the Pre- mier, On whose recommendation five gentle- men were appointed to visit Mr. Cross's pro- perty and make a valuation for the Government, and whether their suitability was inquired into by the Government previous to making the appointments ? He had a list of the gentle- men appointed on this Commission, and he would like very much to know whether their suitability and character were inquired into prior to making the appointment. They should be exceedingly careful in making appointments as valuators, and those appointments should be above suspicion and cavil. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said the valuation of Mr. Cross's property was made by Mr. David Gill for the Land Purchase Board, and on that valuation the recommendation of the Board was based. Accompanying Mr. Gill was Mr. Thomas Hyde, a member of the Land Purchase Board, and Mr. MeKerrow, the Inspector- General. He thought the honourable gentle- man would have nothing to say against the character of those three members of the Board, because if anything could be said against the character of the gentlemen on whose valuation the matter was done he (Mr. Seddon) should he very much surprised, and should regret it very much. He did not know of five gentlemen having been appointed to visit Mr. Cross's pro- perty, but in the near future there would be a probability of a number of witnesses visiting and inspecting the property in order to enable them to give evidence in the Compensation Court, to be held on or about the 23rd Septem- ber, and, as there was great difficulty in getting suitable witnesses, it was not desirable that they should be referred to in a public manner. As regarded the question of who might have visited the farm for the purpose of obtaining informa- tion to enable them to give evidence before the Compensation Court, he did not know who they were. Mr. O'MEARA said he could give the Premier a little information about this estate, as he had gathered all the information himself on his last visit to Woodville. He could give the honour- able gentleman the names of the gentlemen appointed to visit the estate. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) rose to a point of order. Some members had had ques- tions on the Order Paper for many weeks, and he desired to ask whether it was in accordance with the Standing Orders for members to make 1 two speeches in asking questions, and for there to be two replies from the Ministerial benches. 
<page:503>
that only one speech should be made in asking a question, and one in reply; but it was in accordance with parliamentary practice that when a question had been answered by a Minister and the member asking it considered that he had not been understood by the Minister for him to give further information to explain bis question. Mr. O'MEARA said the honourable gentle- man (Mr. Fisher) was the greatest transgressor himself. He would like to point out to the Premier that the following gentlemen were appointed to go over this particular district, and he would give their names : Hon. G. F. Richardson, F. Knight, Joseph H. Harris, W. P. Hartstone, and H. Monteith, for the Go- vernment. Well, if it was necessary to sub- pona witnesses to say what was the value of land in this particular district, he thought it was the duty of the Government, or the head of that department who made the appoint- ments, to inquire very carefully into the charac- ter of these witnesses. It was absurd - Mr. SEDDON rose to a point of order. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER said the honour- able gentleman was now introducing debatable matter, and was out of order. Mr. SEDDON could only say that neither Mr. Richardson, Mr. Monteith, nor the other gentlemen named were sent by the Govern- ment to make a valuation. He had given the honourable gentleman the three names of the  men who were sent by the Government to make a valuation. RIFLES FOR VOLUNTEER OFFICERS. Mr. RHODES | Ellesmere) asked the Minis- ter of Defence, If he cannot see his way to provide officers of Volunteer corps with rifles ? If not, will he grant them the same privileges as members of defence rifle clubs, and allow them to purchase their rifles on the same terms? He did not think it would be a very costly matter to supply all Volunteer officers with rifles ; but, as he realised that only a cer- tain number of officers went in for shooting, he would be satisfied if the Premier could see his way to supply those who put in an application. At the present time an officer was in this position : he had either to purchase a rifle from a private firm or borrow one from a member of his corps, and, as all rifles varied more or less in matters of shooting, an officer had to become acquainted with the peculiar eccentricities of each rifle borrowed before he could make fair shooting. Therefore he did not think he was asking too much when he asked the Premier in this way to supply officers with rifles. If the Premier did not agree to that, he would like him to give a favourable answer to the second part of his question. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said he had no objection to officers purchasing rifles, but he could not set up a precedent that the Government should supply officers with rifles. He would allow officers to purchase rifles at cost price. clubs ? Mr. SEDDON .- No ; at cost price. AMMUNITION FOR VOLUNTEERS. Mr. ARNOLD (Dunedin City) asked the Minister of Defence, If he will reduce the price of ammunition to Volunteer companies so as to further encourage Volunteering and the shooting ability of our young men ? It was generally admitted that one of the greatest encourage- ments young men had to join Volunteer corps was the possibility of shooting-practice. Not only did it encourage them to join a corps, but after they had joined they recognised that it was necessary they should become expert shots. Now, with regard to a supply of ammunition, they recognised that a great majority of the Volunteer corps were composed of working-men, and the price that was charged to the various corps, and through the corps to the members, was so heavy that it was impossible for them to receive the amount of ammunition to practiso with that they should have. He trusted the Government would see their way clear to reduce the prime cost of ammunition to the various corps for the purpose mentioned in his ques- tion. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said they were now charging 11s. per hundred rounds, which was 9d. less than was paid to the Colonial Ammunition Company, so that they lost 9d. on every hundred rounds supplied. He could only say that they must not ride a willing horse to death, nor go too far. "SWEATING." Mr. ARNOLD (Dunedin City) asked the Minister of Labour, If he will, for the purpose of further diminishing "sweating," make such provision as will compel all tradesmen taking orders for tailoring, and employing tailors or tailoresses, to have such work done in work- shops belonging to the firms taking such orders ? Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Labour) said the question implied greater limitation to be en- forced, either than that existing at present or that embodied in the amending Bill now before the House. The existing law put three disabilities on " home-work," namely : (1) If not made in a factory, any garment or other textile article must, until sold, have a label fixed thereto stating that it had not been made in a factory ; (2) the person to whom work had been given out from a factory was forbidden to sublet ; and (3. if any person employed in a factory took work away to do at home an offence was committed. These provisions had been found sufficient to stop " sweating " of any pronounced character. There had been some grumbling among tailors about work being given out. Of course, if the honourable gentleman's question was favourably entertained, "home- work " in the tailoring trade would cease alto- gether. It was really a question as to whether any work should be taken home at all. From a sanitary point of view it would be better if all the work could be done in the workshops. He 
<page:504>
Department that they were giving careful attention to the matter, and that if the law was properly carried out-that is, if there was more effective administration - there would be no necessity for further legislation. WAITAKI MOUNTED RIFLES. Major STEWARD) (Waitaki) asked the Minister of Defence, Whether the offer of the services of the Waitaki Mounted Rifles, with headquarters at Kurow, has been or will be accepted ? As the company desired to go on with their organization, he hoped the honour- able gentleman would inform them as soon as possible that their services would be accepted. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said that the company's services would be accepted. FLOUR-MILLERS' ASSOCIATION. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) asked the Go- vernment, If they are aware that a trust has been formed in the South Island for the purpose of controlling the flour output of New Zealand ; and will they introduce a Bill this session to render illegal this and other trusts whose objects are to destroy competition and exact an artifi- cial price from the people for the necessaries of life ? He would point out that very recently an organization had been formed for the pur- pose of creating a monopoly in the flour trade, and it now controlled all the mills in the colony except two in Timaru and three in Auckland. Thirty-six mills were controlled by the syndi- cate, and one of the immediate results of its  formation was the raising of the price of flour by $1 a ton. He had received communications both from the United Flour-millers' Employés' Society and the Auckland Trades and Labour     Council on the subject, in which strong protests were made against the attempted monopoly, and an appeal was made to him to urge the Government to introduce immediate legislation to deal with it. The Trades and Labour Coun- cil said,- " We think that if this trust is successful it will be able to fix prices of wheat and flour to suit itself-that is to say, that, there being little or no competition in the wheat-market, low prices will rule, while flour will be raised up out of all proportion to the price of wheat ; so that the trust will be bleeding the farmer equally with the consumer." There was also a very strongly worded article in the Napier Telegraph, in which an earnest appeal was made to Parliament to introduce legislation on the subject. He would like to mention that the evil results of powerful trusts in Europe and America were very fully shown in a book that had just arrived in the library. It showed that a large proportion of the earnings of the people were taken by means of artificial prices, in consequence of the enormous power which the accretion of capital gave to those trusts. He hoped the Premier would see his way to give a favourable reply to the question. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said, In the Speech from the Throne the Government announced that legislation would be introduced this session Mr. Seddon Since that announcement had been made, facts had come under his notice which made it almost necessary that they should do something in the matter. He had seen correspondence that had passed between the secretary of the association in the South and a flour-miller who had refused to come in. The pressure that had been used and the threats held out confirmed his opinion that it was about time something was done by the Legislature. He believed that the Auckland millers had refused to join the association. An opportunity would be given Parliament to deal with the matter this session. # CONCILIATION BOARDS. Mr. MILLAR (Dunedin City) asked the Minis- ter of Labour, If in his remarks "that the Conciliation Boards sat too much, and were doing the thing to death," he included the Otago and Southland Board in such remarks. His reason for putting the question was that some very sweeping remarks had been made by the Right Hon. the Premier in connection with the Conciliation Boards of the colony. Now, the Board referred to in the question had been admitted by the Arbitration Court, and by the employers and employés and the Press, to be a Board which had done its work in a most satisfactory manner, and in no sense could the remarks of the Hon. the Premier apply to them. Instead of driving the thing to death, these men had sat till ten and eleven o'clock at night so as to get through. If the honourable member liked to have a return prepared, he thought it would be shown that in no one year had the members of this Board been paid for thirty days. Therefore he thought it was clear that the statement that they were driving the thing to death clearly could not apply to them, neither could the interjection that had been made-that the guinea a day had some- thing to do with it. He was not speaking for other Boards, but he was sure the remark did not apply to this one, and therefore he put the question. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Labour) said he was in this position : that if each member who was interested in a Conciliation Board asked the same question he should then have to fix the remark upon some Board, and he was not going to be drawn into that position. His friend could easily see that by this means he would soon get into what the honourable mem- ber for Ashley would call a cul de sac. He would, however, say this: that the Dunedin Board had done really excellent work. He might also say that he had no reason whatever for withdrawing a single word he had said, and that he believed his remarks had done good, and were required at the time. MILITARY PENSIONS EXTENSION ACT. Major STEWARD (Waimate) asked the Minis- ter of Defence,-(1) Whether it is not necessary to amend " The Military Pensions Extension to Contingents Act, 1900," by adding schedules containing the names of the members of the Sixth and Seventh Contingents, in order to in- 
<page:505>
to the members of the previous contingents by the Acts cited ; (2) if so, will an amending Bill be introduced this session ? Last session they had passed an Act entitled the Military Pen- sions Extension to Contingents Act, the pro- visions of which extended the benefits of the Military Pensions Act to the members of the South African contingents. The Act provided that the principal Act should extend and apply to the forces enrolled by the New Zealand Go- vernment for service in South Africa. Then, sec- tion 3 said, "The following persons, and those only, shall be deemed to be members of the forces enrolled," namely : Those referred to in Schedule I .; those in the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Contingents ; and, next, those who, though not enrolled in New Zealand, were sent to South Africa by the Government and were enrolled there ; and, next, those who, though not sent out to South Africa for the purpose, vet, being New-Zealanders, joined the contingents there ; so it would be seen that the Act absolutely excluded the members of the Sixth and Seventh Contingents now serving in South Africa, who were certainly equally en- titled with the members of the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Contingents to be included under the Act. He therefore begged to submit the question standing in his name. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said a Bill would be introduced this session. It was necessary this should be done. There were some cases that had come under his notice that really demanded an alteration of the law, other- wise grave injustice would be done. As to plac- ing these names in the Schedule of the Bill, most decidedly they would be so placed, and given the same position as those in Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 Contingents. Just to show members a case in point, if a soldier's mother was a widow and anything happened to the son, then the mother was entitled to a pension ; but there was a case where the father was bedridden and the son was maintaining father, mother, and family, and, being wounded and incapacitated, nothing could be done for them at all. There was another case of a similar character where the son had been killed. In cases of this kind the law ought to be amended so as to give power to consider all such cases. Major STEWARD asked if there would be a nominal schedule containing the names of the Sixth and Seventh. Mr. SEDDON .- Yes. DUNEDIN PUBLIC ART-GALLERY. Mr. MILLAR (Dunedin City) asked 12.0. the Premier, If he will grant a subsidy of $1 for £1 on any subscriptions raised for the purpose of building a public art-gallery in Dun- edin ? He would like to point out to the right honourable gentleman that there was an art- gallery in Dunedin at the present time, but, unfortunately, no proper buildings to put the pictures in. There were some very valuable pictures in the collection, and they had to be put in a temporary galvanised-iron building. Christchurch, he believed, had got a site some through the munificence of some private citi- zens, was provided with very handsome build- ings for the purposes of an art-gallery, and on any day you liked to go to these art-galleries you would find students there engaged in copy- ing the pictures. The people of Dunedin were similarly desirous of putting up an art-gallery, and, as it would cost a considerable amount. and seeing that the Government had subsidised public institutions of various kinds, he asked now if they would grant a pound-for-pound subsidy towards the erection of an art-gallery in Dunedin. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said the matter would be referred to Cabinet for consideration. # AUSTRALASIAN SQUADRON. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) asked the Government, If any practical steps have been taken towards securing the strengthening of the Australasian squadron, as recommended in paragraph 20) of the report of the Secret Defence Committee ? In asking this question he would like to point out that section 20 of the report of the Secret Defence Committee of 1900 was as follows :- "Your Committee, having regard to the altered international political conditions, es- pecially in China and the Pacific, recommend that representations should be made by the Government of this colony to the Common- wealth of Australia and to the Imperial Govern- ment as to the necessity of strengthening the Australasian squadron by raising the class and increasing the number of the cruisers com- posing that squadron ; the increased cost to be paid by the Commonwealth of Australia and by New Zealand on the basis of the present agreement." That step seemed to the Committee to be one of urgent necessity, and from recent events and the disclosures made both in the House of Commons and by the Chairman of the Navy League it was apparent that the necessity had become still greater at the present time, owing to the disparity between the ships of France and Russia and those of Britain in the China Seas. He hoped to hear that the Government had taken some steps in the matter, as recommended by the Defence Com- mittee. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said it would be in the recollection of honourable members that he had stated the necessity of this in 1897. He had repeated the statement since then, and, as time went on, the necessity for strengthening our naval forces in the colonies and in Austral- asian waters became more imperative. The honourable member would note that during the last few days a report from the admiral in charge of the station, Admiral Beaumont, had been given to the Federal Government, and, now that the Australasian Governments were definitely informed what was the position, it would be for them to make representations to the Imperial authorities to have the Austral- asian squadron strengthened, and on the basis of our present contribution. It was futile to 
<page:506>
mation that had been asked for by the Federal Government had been obtained. As honourable members were aware, we must take joint action in the matter, and, as far as New Zealand was concerned, that joint action would be taken to make the necessary representations to the Im- perial Government. Mr. NAPIER understood the Premier to say, "On the basis of the present contribution " the Imperial Government were going to be asked to strengthen the Australasian squadron. Now, he believed there was a unanimous feeling through- out the country that our contribution should be increased, if a demand was made for the increase of the squadron. Mr. SEDDON said it followed as a natural sequence that if we got more ships we would have more to pay. # IMPERIAL OR COLONIAL NAVAL RESERVE. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) asked the Minister of Defence, If he has communicated with the Imperial Government and the Com- monwealth of Australia with regard to the formation of an Imperial or Colonial Naval Reserve, as directed in paragraph 18 of the report of the Secret Defence Committee of the 21st December, 1900? Paragraph 18 of that report was as follows :- " With regard to the subject of the establish- ment in this colony of a branch of an Imperial or Colonial Naval Reserve, your Committee consider the matter to be one of such import-  32106019788246 ance that they recommend negotiations being entered into by the Government of New Zea- land with the Commonwealth of Australia and the Imperial Government with a view of ascer-     taining whether some satisfactory arrangements can be made upon the subject." The report which : he right honourable gentle- man referred to in his answer to the last question only emphasized what the admiral on the station had said in New Zealand-namely, that it was useless to have a Naval Reserve which was such only in name. We had a Naval Volunteer Force here which knew nothing about naval warfare. They were really Garrison Artillery Volunteers, and what the admiral wanted was that if there was to be a Naval Reserve it should be a Naval Reserve capable of going on board ships and understanding the working of ships' guns. Now, the Defence Committee thought some steps ought to be taken with a view of forming the nucleus of a local Naval Reserve in fact, one which would be thoroughly ethcient, and which might be prepared to supply men for manning Her Majesty's ships in time of war. It was borne in upon the minds of all those who took an interest in defence questions that if the war-vessels out here had to go fifteen thousand miles to recruit in time of war there would be very little chance of having the ships in an efficient condition. All the principal authorities, he thought he might say, agreed that not only men but stores should be in reserve in various parts of the Empire for the purpose of refitting and remanning; and that Mr. Seddon and which resulted in the recommendation that negotiations should be entered into with the Imperial Government and the Commonwealth to see if some practical scheme could not be devised for the purpose mentioned. He trusted that no time would be lost in carrying out the Defence Committee's recommendation. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said the Government had received a communication from the Secretary of State on this subject, and on the receipt of that communication action was deferred. # RIFLE-RANGES. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) asked the Government, If it is intended to introduce a Bill during the present session of Parliament to legalise the recommendation of the Secret Defence Committee, in the report of the 21st September, 1900, paragraph 10, (), regarding the compulsory acquisition of land for rifle- ranges ? It was generally agreed that if our young men could not shoot they would be almost valueless for the purpose of defence ; and in order to shoot well they must have rifle-ranges for practice. Now, a difficulty had arisen in regard to the acquisition of rifle- ranges under the present law. The officers of the Defence Department were blocked in the vicinity of Auckland a little while ago, when they wished to acquire a rifle-range, owing to the owners asking an exorbitant price for the land required. There was no power under the Public Works Act, nor was there power under the Defence Act Amendment Act of 1900, to compulsorily take land for rifle - ranges upon payment of compensation at a fair valuation. Singularly enough, the Government had power to take land for defence purposes generally, vet it was not thought that rifle-ranges came under that heading. At all events, there was a doubt about it, and, under the circumstances, the Government had made no effort to acquire land for rifle-ranges. He thought legislation should be introduced at once to deal with this diffi- culty. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said the Government were of opinion that, before it was too late, pro- vision should be made to provide rifle-ranges close to every centre of population. He himself looked upon shooting and rifle practice as being of much more importance than the drilling of our Volunteers, and it was quite clear that something would have to be done in this respect. Neither in Auckland nor in Welling- ton was there a suitable range. As regarded Wellington, Trentham was too far away, and the working-men could not possibly spare the time nor incur the expense to go out there. There ought to be some place near Wellington so that the men could get up early in the morning and have their practice, or in the summer they could practice in the evenings. He had in his eye a site for a rifle-range near Wellington, and he proposed to ask the officers to make a report upon the site, and if they con- sidered it suitable he intended to take the land for the purpose. Of course, they could take it 
<page:507>
for defence purposes, although it might not be for a rifle-range. If there was any defect in the law he would see to it. # DEFENCE. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) asked the Minister of Defence, Whether he has com- municated with the Imperial Government in terms of paragraph 16 of the report of the Secret Defence Committee of the 21st Septem- ber, 1900? Paragraph 16 of the Secret Defence Committee's report was as follows : - "That the Imperial authorities be applied to by the Government of the colony to advance the capital necessary to enable the colony to carry out such of the above recommendations as may be adopted by Parliament, and upon the terms set forth in the statement made in the House of Representatives on the 20th July, 1900, by the Right Hon. R. J. Seddon, Premier and Minister of Defence, referred to in the early portion of this report." The recommendations of the Defence Com- mittee, adopted by Parliament last session, involved an expenditure of #373,428, which required an annual cost of $59,303, in order to place the defences of the colony on a satisfactory footing, and it was apparent, of course, to the Committee that the colony could not stand an immediate expenditure to that extent ; therefore the Committee recommended that application should be made to the Imperial authorities to see whether that Government would contribute, and, if so, in what form. This was an important matter, and should not be allowed to drift. Twelve months had passed now since the De- fence Committee reported, and, although a good deal had been done considering the amount of money at the disposal of the Defence Depart- ment - they had now an abundant supply of the most modern rifles and ammunition . still all the items of Schedule A in the report of the Defence Committee had not received attention. There was not one single item in the report that the Committee thought could be deleted with safety to the colony. Therefore it was very necessary that immediate negotiations should be commenced with the Imperial Government. He knew that the Minister had had a great deal to do lately in connection with the Royal visit ; but still this was of vital importance to the Empire and to the colony, and it would be false economy to delay assuming obligations which the conditions of our existence as an insular colony demanded. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said he was Colonial Treasurer, and, with the very heavy claims now made upon the Imperial Treasury and the increased taxation necessary, it would be futile at the present juncture to press this matter. They must wait until the Imperial difficulties were over and a normal condition was established. They could then ask for this and go into it thoroughly. He thought to press for it now would mean a negative reply. Mr. NAPIER would point out that this was a most suitable time. The Imperial Govern- ment were now spending on outlying stations millions of money. They were going to spend large sums straight away at Hongkong, at Thursday Island, and also at other strategic points in the Empire. The Imperial Govern- ment recognised that it was necessary to make this expenditure on these outlying stations, and there could be no more opportune time to push this colony's claims than when so much money was being spent on Imperial naval bases, espe- cially as Auckland was now an Imperial naval station. Mr. SEDDON said the places to which the honourable member had referred were points at which, for strategical reasons, it was absolutely necessary that the Imperial Government should spend money. It was quite different with New Zealand. To press the claims recommended by the Committee now would, he repeated. bring forth a negative reply. If they waited till a more favourable opportunity the probabilities were that something would be done. He was speaking now with authority. RETURNED TROOPERS. Mr. FIELD (Otaki) asked the Minister of Defence, Whether the Government will es- tablish some systematic method of dealing with applications for employment by returned troopers from South Africa ? He understood that the Government had already very properly stated that they would, if possible, find employ- ment for returned troopers. He did not think it should be necessary for these men to have to go to members of Parliament and ask them to use their influence to get them employment under the Government. There should be some bureau established or some other system by means of which the Defence Department should deal with this matter. He had no doubt the Government were paying some attention to this subject, but he trusted the Premier would be able to say that the Government would make a strenuous and systematic attempt to find employment for returned troopers, and in par- ticular those who were incapacitated from doing hard manual work. Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) might say that there was a systematic method now in operation. And not only that, but he knew that the Christchurch Press was voluntarily and freely helping by inserting advertisements gratis on behalf of those who are out of employment. In reply to an interjection, he might say that it did not matter whether the paper was Liberal or Tory, if any paper was helping a patriotic and proper object it should be commended for doing so, and he would like to see all other papers throughout the colony doing the same thing. However, the Government were finding places for these men as fast as they could. It was only natural, however, that when a large number of men came back to the colony some of them should be out of employment for a time. He might say that some of them were a little fastidious, and wanted better positions than those they held when they went away. Of course, he did not blame them, but the Govern- ment were doing all they could. 
<page:508>
Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) asked the Premier, Whether the Government will recoup the Brothers the cost of the several trials in connection with the Stoke Orphanage-which were in the nature of State trials-the juries having returned a verdict of "Not guilty " in every case? It would be remembered that, consequent upon certain alarming reports in regard to the management of the Stoke Indus- trial School, the City of Nelson was thrown into a state of ferment, and an investigation was made by a Royal Commission, which resulted in extraordinary and sensational statements being made throughout the colony and in the House in regard to the acts of cruelty which had been perpetrated within the walls of the institution. These sensational statements re- sulted in the use of inflammatory language in the House, and ultimately steps were taken which led to the prosecution of the Brothers who were teachers in the school. These trials extended over twenty one days -from the 21st November to the 12th December. There were twelve charges in all : six were tried and six were abandoned. Of the six cases tried, ver- dicts of acquittal were recorded in every case. He would epitomize the cases and their re- sults. On the 21st November, 1900, at the Supreme Court, Wellington, before his Honour Mr. Justice Edwards, James Solan (Brother Kilian) was charged with committing a common assault, which Mr. Bell, the Crown Prosecutor, described as consisting of " unkind treatment." The case lasted the whole of that day, and was unfinished. On the 22nd November, after a second day's hearing, the jury retired at twenty- five minutes to six o'clock, and after a quarter of an hour's absence returned into Court with a verdict of "Not guilty." The case occupied two days, and the jury settled the matter in a quarter of an hour. On the 23rd November, be- fore Mr. Justice Edwards, James Solan (Brother Kilian) was charged with common assault. The jury retired at half-past five o'clock, and in less than ten minutes returned into Court with a verdict of "Not guilty." On the 29th November, before Mr. Justice Edwards, the Crown Prosecutor entered a nolle prosequi in all the other charges against James Solan (Brother Kilian). On the same day - 29th November- before Mr. Justice Edwards, Edward Forrier (Brother Wybertus) was charged with having committed an indecent assault on William Hardwick. The Judge said, " Personally, he would not punish a cat on the boy's evidence," whereupon the Crown Prosecutor, Mr. Bell, consented to accept a verdict of " Not guilty." On the 30th November, before Mr. Justice Edwards, Edward Forrier (Brother Wybertus) was charged with having committed an in- decent assault on Thomas Francis Owens. The jury, after twenty minutes' retirement, returned a verdict of " Not guilty." On the 1st Decem- ber, before Mr. Justice Edwards, Edward Forrier (Brother Wybertus) was charged with having committed a common assault on William Ross. Mr. Justice Edwards said, " It is quite impossible these things could have taken place retiring from the box, returned a verdict of " Not guilty." Then the Judge was changed. On the 3rd December, before the Chief Justice, Sir Robert Stout, Edward Forrier (Brother Wybertus) was charged with having committed an indecent assault on William Joseph Guckert. Mr. Skerrett. who appeared in all the cases for the accused, mentioned that "these cases were looked at by many persons from a sectarian point of view. During the empan- nelling of the jury counsel for the Crown, as well as counsel for the defence, had, in making challenges, proceeded on the assumption that the cases were being viewed in that way. The jury probably did not include any one who agreed with the religion of the accused, and probably included some men who were opposed to it." The jury disagreed, after being locked up for one hour and five minutes. On the 10th December, at the second trial, the pre- siding Judge, Sir Robert Stout, in summing up, made the following extraordinary state- ment : "If in cases of this kind the evi- dence of the accused was to be believed, then the crime in question might as well be taken out of the statute-book." The jury returned at half-past eight p.m., after nearly a three- hours retirement, with a verdict of "Not guilty." The New Zealand Times' report of the case states that "the verdict was received with a round of applause." That was the end of the trials. On the 11th December Mr. Bell announced, as appeared from a report in the New Zealand Times of the 12th December, that "the Crown had decided not to proceed with the remaining charges against Edward Forrier (Brother Wybertus), which comprised three for common and two for indecent assaults alleged to have been committed on boys at the Stoke Industrial School. This decision brings the Stoke cases to an end. In all the cases tried the juries brought in verdicts of . Not guilty.' Two of the cases against Brother Wybertus which came to a hearing broke down. Both Brother Wybertus and James Solan (Brother Kilian) are now, therefore, acquitted of the indictments found by the grand jury, the charges against the latter having been disposed of in his favour the other week." Thus it would be seen the trials covered a period of twenty-one days. It was known also that the Crown had adopted the extraordinary course of excluding from the juries, by way of challenge, every person thought to be a Roman Catholic, and so, as it afterwards appeared, there was no Roman Catholic on any of the juries. Mr. SEDDON thought the honourable gentle- man was trespassing on debatable matter, and accusing the Government of doing that which they did not do or authorise. Mr. FISHER said he was only remarking on what the Crown Prosecutor actually did in Court. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER said be understood the honourable gentleman was only stating facts. Mr. FISHER said he was only stating facts. 
<page:509>
Mr. FISHER said there could be no possible doubt about what actually took place in Court -namely, that the challenges were made by the Crown Prosecutor. Mr. SEDDON .- They were not challenged by the Crown because they belonged to a cer- tain section of the community. Mr. FISHER said he was surely entitled to believe what he had seen with his own eyes. The right to challenge was very freely exercised by the Crown Prosecutor, and the jury as em- pannelled might be truly said to be absolutely free from bias or prejudice of every description. These trials were instituted in deference to a strong public demand, and, having regard to the severe ordeal through which the Brothers passed and the extreme importance of the trials themselves, the State being as much interested as the accused, the costs of the several trials ought to be returned to the persons who had been charged. He need hardly say that in re- gard to the matter a strong feeling existed in the minds of a large number of people in all parts of the colony-not only of those of the religion of the persons charged; it would be a great mistake to think that-but of New Zealand colonists of all shades of opinion. The verdicts in all the cases bore one interpretation -namely, that there was no ground whatever for any of the charges. That was the result of the trials, extending over twenty-one days, be- fore two Judges-the Chief Justice and Judge Edwards - and six separate juries. Having regard to the importance of the trials, and the importance to this colony of the in- terests involved, and the accused having been proved clearly not guilty of the charges made against them, it would be only an act of be- coming generosity on the part of the Govern- ment to repay to them the actual expenses to which they were put. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said, In his opinion, the Stoke Orphanage matter was one of those unpleasant episodes in our Parliament and history about which the least said the better for all concerned. It was an unfortunate in- cident, and the sooner it was forgotten the better. No application had been made to the department for the repayment of these costs, and, presuming such an application had been made, it was unusual for the Government in such a case to refund them. RETURN RE LARGE ESTATES. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) asked the Premier, Whether he is correctly reported in the New Zealand Times of the 1st August as having stated, in answer to a deputation on rating on unimproved values, that "a return just laid on the table of the House showed that large estates were increasing, despite the num- ber which had been acquired for settlement" ; and, if so, whether he was aware that the return alluded to was ordered in August, 1899, and was returned as at 31st March, 1899, and is therefore two years old and out of date? The question had been so long on the Order Paper that the return alluded to by the Premier was the return laid on the table to the order of Mr. Millar : "That there be laid before this House a return showing-(1) The value of all freehold lands in the colony at the 31st March, 1899; (2) the total amount of mortgages on freehold registered at that date." This return had been ordered in August, 1899, and was only laid on the table of the House this session. He was aware that the returns had been made, contrary to the order, up to the 31st March, 1900, but even then they were not up to date. These re- turns were always compiled a year late. The land valuations were sent out in May or June, and therefore a return bearing date the 31st March, 1900, would be compiled on information which would be obtained in May or 12.30. June, 1899, and therefore the return which the Premier alluded to would be cer- tainly two years old, and was not a correct statement of the affairs of the colony at the present moment. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said, When the honourable gentleman put his question on the Order Paper he was evidently under the im- pression that the return only brought the valuation up to 1899, whereas the return itself was up to date. It showed the classification according to the capital value of the land on the 31st March, 1900, and, so far as the value of the land was concerned, they could not ask for more-they already had what was wanted. When he stated that the number of estates had increased he gave the particulars where the particular increases had occurred. For in- stance, in estates of £1,000 and under $2,000 there was an increase from 6,755 in 1889 to 10,496 in 1900. In estates of $2,000 and under £3,000 there was an increase of over a thou- sand-from 2.299 to 3,680. From £3,000 and under $4,000 there was an increase of over six hundred. From £4,000 and under $5,000 there was an increase of 888. From £5,000 and under $10,000 there was an increase of from 1,237 to 1,900. From $10,000 and under $20,000 they had gone up from 623 to 841. Then, in regard to estates of $20,000 and under $50,000 the total number of owners in 1889 was 338, and in 1900 it was 394. From $50,000 and under £100,000 there was a decrease, from 107 in 1889 to 92 in 1900; in $100,000 and under #200,000 there was an increase of two estates-from 37 in 1889 to 39 in 1900; in $200,000 and over they stood in 1889 at 11 owners, and in 1900 there were only 11, so that there had been no change in that item. As far as the number of the estates was concerned there was an increase in the number of these large estates. Mr. R. THOMPSON (Marsden) asked if that had not been brought about by the revaluations. Mr. SEDDON said it mattered not to him how it had been brought about, the fact was that there was the increased numbers. He thought it might have the effect after a certain time of taking them from one scale to another, but still there was the increase of prices all round. 
<page:510>
Mr. W. FRASER said the areas had not increased. Mr. SEDDON said he was not saying any. thing about the areas; but he would like to call members' attention to this fact : that this was the case in regard to these estates of $50,000 and over, notwithstanding that the Government had bought so large a number of estates. At all events, there was the fact as given by this return. It would not make any alteration if we got the area, because if a man had bought a piece of ground he would keep it as a separate estate; unless we had them jointly as landowners we would not be able to trace them by the area. However, taking it any way we like, there had been an increase in these estates during the last ten years. SOCIETIES FOR THE PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO WOMEN AND CHILDREN. Mr. TANNER (Avon) asked the Premier, If the Government will consider the propriety of subsidising the revenues of the New Zealand societies for the prevention of cruelty to women and children ? He asked the question in con- sequence of the statement in Mr. Commissioner Tunbridge's report, that there had been a marked increase in the number of criminal assaults on young children. Owing to the helplessness of this section of the community, and the fact that the police were overburdened with work, and the difficulty of moving the police to take action in many cases of this kind, the prosecution had to be left largely to the  initiative of these societies, and they had done well so far as they were able. There were many cases of which we heard little because of the utter lack of method or means to bring them before the Court. He would be glad to hear what the Premier said as to the advisa- bility of giving assistance to these societies. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said his colleague answered a similar question the other day. Mr. TANNER said. That was about bullocks and dogs ; this is about women and children. Mr. SEDDON said it was well known that the legislation and administration of the Go- vernment had had in view the improving of the condition of the women and children of the colony. No one regretted more than the Government the increase of the trouble that the honourable gentleman referred to. But, in his opinion, we would have to look to another source entirely, and one which the public, either wilfully or blindly, refused to recognise. He said this Legislature was a good deal responsible for what was going on in that respect. Mr. TANNER .- What are the Crown Prose- cutors doing ? Mr. SEDDON said the Crown Prosecutors would not stop it ; the Legislature had a good deal to do with it. An Hon. MEMBER .- How? Mr. SEDDON said he would not say how now, but there was no doubt about it ; and to stop it, in his opinion, we would have to go back. But so far as the punishment of the wrongdoers was concerned, in the face of the advice given by those intrusted with the re- sponsibility he thought he should have to do something. It was a question, of course, whether the law at the present time gave us sufficient power. He was inclined to think himself that it did. However, if it did not, it would be the duty of the Government, unless there was an alteration, to do something in respect to it. We must have our children and women protected from the gross outrages that were occurring. "MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS ACT. 1900." Mr. HALL (Waipawa) asked the Premier, If the Government will introduce an amendment to section 91 of " The Municipal Corporations Act, 1900," so as to permit special rates to be banked to the District Fund Account of boroughs? He had been induced to ask this question in consequence of a communication he had from a Borough Council in his district. The Borough Council in question complained that, notwithstanding they had a very consider- able amount of revenue on hand, they were not allowed to place that money to the credit of the general fund. Consequently, they were paying interest on an overdraft, and at the same time they had a large amount of money in the shape of separate rates in the bank, which for the time being would wipe the overdraft out. He wanted to see if the Minister would amend the Act so that a Municipal Corporation would not have to pay interest on an amount of money on over- draft when they had funds lying in the bank. The honourable gentleman would know the section he referred to. It was section 91, which read as follows :- "(1.) All moneys belonging to the Corpora- tion shall be paid into such bank as the Council from time to time appoints and publicly notifies (hereinafter called 'the bank'). (2.) Moneys in connection with the general account herein- after mentioned, and all such fines and penal- ties and amounts of fines and penalties as mentioned in section ninety hereof, shall be paid into an account at the bank to be called the ' District Fund Account." " He wanted to say that, notwithstanding the fact that a Council might have a large amount of money at credit, it might at the same time have a large overdraft. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) scarcely thought there was sufficient to warrant an alteration of the Municipal Corporations Act. They only passed the general Act last session, and he thought something more should be required than was now asked before an amendment was made. He believed that a great deal depended upon the Borough Councils themselves. There was a danger of getting accounts mixed up, and of moneys being used for purposes other than those for which they were in ended. A good deal could be said on both sides. In any case, he did not think an amendment was required for the purpose mentioned. Other alterations might be necessary, and, if so, the whole question could then be dealt with.

RETURNED TROOPERS' PAY. Mr. MEREDITH (Ashley) asked the Minis- ter of Defence, Whether the Government will give a definite assurance to the returned troopers from South Africa of the date when their lawful claims for arrears of pay may be expected ? He had received two letters on the subject from returned troopers. One of them was dated the 5th instant, and in it the writer stated :- "I relied on my arrears of pay as a mem- ber of the Third Contingent to meet the half-yearly rent of my own and my brother's section. I wrote to the Defence Department, Christchurch, asking that the money should be forwarded as soon as possible. The money has not arrived yet, consequently we lose the 10-per-cent. rebate allowed on rents paid before the 31st July last. In our case it amounts to $6. It appears to me to be very unjust that one Government department withholds money due for so long, while another department im- poses a penalty for non-prompt payment of rent." That young man belonged to the Third Con- tingent, and returned to the colony about three months ago. He and his brother . ere tenants on the Cheviot Estate. He had another com- munication, dated 12th August, from a trooper who returned to the colony about ten months ago. It was as follows : "I may say that the Defence Office has not paid us our back money yet ; also, we were told the Imperial Government voted a bonus of £5 a man to all colonials who served in South Africa. I have not yet heard regarding it. I am not hard up for money, but I think it is time the Government paid up our lawful claims. Also, troopers having their own horses : the Premier recently said that the Government would pay for the horses of all deserving cases. Will you ask him what he means by that? I had my own horse, and would like to know about it." Although the writer of the second letter he had just read returned to the colony about ten months ago, the arrears of his pay had not yet been settled. Those two cases would show the Premier that there was something decidedly wrong in the management of the Defence De- partment. That one man should be kept out of arrears of pay for ten months and another for three months was a grave reflection on the Government. In consequence of not receiving the £60 that was due to him, one of the troopers had lost a rebate in his rent of £6. owing by him and his brother as Crown ten- ants. If the Premier desired it, he would place the letters at his disposal for departmental in- quiry, and hoped the matter would be attended to at once, and the men paid their just and well-earned claims. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) asked the honourable gentleman if he would include in his question the case of Sergeant Mitchell, whose pay was in arrear. He had not long returned from South Africa, and the Govern- ment had asked him to go back ; but why should he do that while there was pay due to him here that he could not get ? Mr. SEDDON (Minister of Defence) said, If the honourable member for Ashley had given him particulars of the cases referred to before putting the question he would then have been able to give the departmental reply. There must be something deficient. There was no man so much as ten months in arrear. Either the man was not entitled to the payment de- manded or there was some dispute between him and the department, and he ought to have told the honourable gentleman the facts re- specting it. He (the Premier) undertook to say there was something wrong. Possibly ho was claiming more than his certificates entitled him to be paid. There were any amount of those cases. In some cases the men had got the money, and when the pay-sheets came back from Africa it was found that they had been paid twice over. Well, he was not going to throw away public money. If the case was not shown to be one right for payment the Government would not pay. As to the cases the honourable member referred to by , name, he would make inquiries and let him know the result of the inquiry. The department told him that, with very few exceptions of disputed cases, all the returned troopers of the First, Second, and Third Contingents had been paid. Regarding the other case, where £6 was alleged to be due, the probability was that the £6 was lying in the office of the officer commanding the district. Mr. MEREDITH said the young trooper he referred to was at Cheviot, and in consequence of the Defence Department not paying him he had lost the 10 per cent. of the Government rebate, which amounted to £6. Mr. SEDDON said, Not knowing the par- ticulars of the case, he could not give the honourable member a definite reply : but he could say that if he was one of those who came back with the Fourth or Fifth Contingents, their accounts had only just been finished by the Officer Commanding. If he belonged to the First, Second, or Third Contingents, the officers had finished their work weeks and weeks ago, and their certificates and money had been sent to the officers commanding the districts, and the young man had not made application. It was one of two things : either there was a dispute as to the amount owing, and there was no certificate for it, or the money had not been applied for at the proper quarter -to the Paymaster General : it was not kept back by the Government. Then, with respect to Sergeant Mitchell : He might say that he had treated him with consideration and gene- rosity. The honourable gentleman could see the papers, and he would find that such was the case. No one regretted what had oc- curred more than he did himself; but he did not see that there was anything more that he could do. The trooper's wife died in Wellington, and he (the Premier) had given instructions for the fact to be cabled, and the trooper had obtained leave to return to Wel- lington. The man was an Imperial soldier and had been granted six months' leave, and had been in Wellington six weeks. Of course, the 
<page:512>
question was, What were they going to do ? The man had asked that the Government should give him employment. Well, they had no employment for him, and said that he must go back to his duty in South Africa. The man said he preferred to stay here rather than to leave for South Africa ; but the arrangement had been that he should go back. He was an Imperial soldier, and the Government could not do anything in his case. Nothing more than had been done could be done. GOVERNMENT LIFE INSURANCE. Mr. BARCLAY (Dunedin City) asked the Government, Whether the Government Life Insurance Department can see their way to charge interest on the lowest scale where a bor- rower has borrowed £100 or over, though on separate policies? He desired to ask the ques- tion in view of these facts : When a person borrowed £100 or over £100 from the Govern- ment Life Insurance Department on his policy he was charged 5 per cent. interest ; but if a borrower had two policies and borrowed say £60 on one policy and $50 on another, making a total of £110, he was charged 6 per cent. Well, it seemed to him that it would be only right to charge the smaller rate of 5 per cent., whether the amount was in one policy or spread over two policies, so long as it was over the £100. It seemed unfair that the rate should be 6 per cent. instead of 5 per cent., simply because the amount was in two policies. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said it had always  been the practice of the department to treat loans on separate policies belonging to one policyholder in exactly the same way as if they were held by different individuals, for the fol- lowing reason : Each policy, being a distinct con- tract, must have a definite and proper (that is, within the surrender value) portion of the loan allocated to it. The position was not the same as, for instance, where the loan was granted on mortgage of land where several securities were involved. In the latter case only one account would be kept, but in the case of the policies a separate account had to be kept for each policy. The necessity for this arose mainly from the fact that the premiums on one policy might be allowed to fall into arrear and the arrears eventually exhaust the surrender value, and the policy lapsed, while the other remained in force. They had to debit the charges of any policy against the surrender value of that policy alone. Any other practice would lead to con- fusion and misunderstanding. They were in a different position from an outsider taking a mortgage over several policies. They were under a legal obligation to keep the policy in force so long as the surrender value of the policy-less the loan and interest thereon and the arrears of premium-was sufficient to pay a quarter's premium. Therefore, although on the first blush it would appear to be quite rea- sonable to put the policies together for the pay- ment of interest, as the honourable member had suggested, yet it would be seen by what the department said that it was otherwise, and that it might bring about confusion. Mr. Seddon Mr. BARCLAY confessed that he did not see it. CRIMINAL ASSAULTS ON WOMEN AND CHILDREN. Mr. T. MACKENZIE (Waihemo) asked the Government, Whether they will, in view of the deplorable increase of criminal assaults on women and children, as reported by Commis- sioner Tunbridge and Lieut .- Colonel Hume, amend the Criminal Code Act in the direction of increasing the severity of punishment ? The protection of women and girls from criminal assaults was a most serious matter, and of the utmost importance, and he ventured to think that, as the Premier had as much at heart as any other member of the House the prevention of these infamous crimes, he would agree with him (Mr. Mackenzie) that they ought to apply the lash more severely to this class of criminal than was the case at the present time. The fact was that every now and again the public were shocked by some dreadful crime being perpetrated on defenceless children or women, and if, as a people, we were going to enjoy the reputation of a very high civilisation, it was incumbent upon us to stop these outrages, and it could be done, and thus protect our children, girls, and women in such a manner as to show the world we knew what to do with the brutes and scoundrels who committed these assaults. He would like to see these fellows lashed within an inch of their life, and if that were done more frequently than the Judges now did, these crimes would be seldom attempted. He had noticed with intense indignation that some of the Judges did not apply the lash at all, and some very sparingly. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) deplored the fact that our criminal records should show that there was an increase in the direction indicated by the honourable member, and to that extent our fair fame was sullied. These crimes needed to be stamped out, and that punishment should be accorded which would prevent them went without saying. But he believed our present law gave sufficient power to deal with them. It was a question for those who administer the law. Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- You should not give them the option. Mr. SEDDON thought they must leave it to those intrusted with the carrying-out of the law and imposing the penalties. He hoped the fact that the matter had been drawn attention to by these officers, and by the honourable member, and also by the Press of the colony, would have its effect. He did not think further legislation on the subject was required, as there was sufficient power at the present time. COLONIAL-MADE SADDLERY FOR NEW ZEALAND TROOPS. Mr. FIELD (Otaki), for Mr. Witheford (Auckland City), asked the Government, If they will issue instructions that in future only colonial-made saddlery shall be supplied to the New Zealand troops ? 
<page:513>
Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said there was no necessity for any instructions being given. As he had told the House, he intended to intro- duce a Bill repealing the provision in the Defence Act which gave the Minister of De- fence power to admit free uniforms and mili- tary equipments. ## STATE GOLD-MINING AND ISSUE OF SOVEREIGNS. Mr. FIELD (Otaki), for Mr. Witheford (Auckland City), asked the Colonial Treasurer, Whether the Government will consider the ad- visability and practicability of the State mining its own gold, and issuing its own sovereigns ? Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said this was going in quite the opposite direction from what the late worthy Mr. Macandrew advocated. He ad- vocated a bale of paper and the printing press. If he were to answer this in the affirmative it would be said he was giving way to his own weakness. But he did think something might be done in the way of paper, and keeping gold against it ; and if they adopted that view they would have to buy the gold, and he thought they could buy gold much cheaper than they could mine it. # RALPH PORTER. Major STEWARD (Waitaki) asked the Minister for Railways, Whether his attention has been called to the very severe penalty and unnecessary costs imposed in a case of cattle- trespass on a railway reserve at Glenavy, brought against one Ralph Porter, on the 1st August, in the Stipendiary Magistrate's Court, Waimate, the defendant having been fined £2-namely, £1 per head-and saddled with £2 17s. costs, including fee of counsel (£2 2s.), said counsel having been brought from Timaru to prosecute, although the de- fendant had previously notified his intention to plead guilty ; and, if so, will he take steps to secure that such counsel's fee shall be re- funded to Mr. Porter? He asked this ques- tion in consequence of a communication he had received from one Ralph Porter, under date 1st August, to the following effect :- "I beg to bring under your notice a gross in- justice that has been done to me to-day. The facts are that two cows, my property, strayed across the railway-line on the 8th June last, and grazed for twenty minutes on the reserve be- yond the line, for which I was summoned to appear at Waimate to-day before Major Keddell, charged with allowing cattle to trespass, and fined, including costs, $4 17s. Now, here is where the injustice of the case comes in. After receiving the summons, I saw the railway ganger, Mr. Seaman, and explained to him as he had seen the cows trespass, that I would plead guilty of the offence to save any friction and expense. But, to-day, Mr. White appeared for the department and pressed for a heavy penalty, altough I explained to His Worship on the bench that this being my first offence, and the railway being unfenced, a small fine ought to meet my case. But, no; I was to be treated VOL. CXVII .- 32. as one that had committed the offence twenty times, and fined £1 for each head and saddled with #2 17s. of expenses. Now, I consider that I ought not to have been called upon to pay Mr. White, as the police could have prosecuted as well, if not better. The railway is left un- fenced, no security whatever ; even if you were in attendance on any stock it would be impos- sible to keep them from getting on the line. I would deem it a great favour if you will kindly look at my complaint as a public one, and lay the matter before the Hon. the Minister for Railways. I do not think I am wrong in saying that he will at once see that I have been severely dealt with, and order the £2 2s. to be refunded." This man considered he had been very severely dealt with, and so did he (Major Steward); and, although the grievance might appear a somewhat small one, it seemed to him very hard that any settler should be put to the unnecessary expense referred to. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) was advised that the Railway Department had pre- viously warned Mr. Porter against permitting his cattle to trespass on the railway, and he was written to in May last in respect to the trespass on the line at Glenavy of five cows belonging to him, and was then informed that he would be prosecuted if a repetition of the offence occurred. Two of his cattle trespassed on the line again on the 8th June last, and proceedings were accord- ingly instituted against Mr. Porter. The de- partment had no definite knowledge of his intention to plead guilty. Mr. Porter, it now appeared, had informed the ganger at Glenavy a few days before the case was heard that " he supposed he would plead guilty"; but, as the department had no positive knowledge of his intention to so plead, it was compelled to take steps to secure a conviction. Cattle trespass on railways was a source of great danger to the travelling public, and in the interests of public safety prosecutions were undertaken in all cases where convictions could be secured. Major STEWARD said, That was quite true, and for years past the department had been urged to fence that particular place, which was very dangerous, and he had twice brought the matter up in the House, both last session and this session. INVERCARGILL RAILWAY-STATION. Mr. HANAN (Invercargill) asked the Minister for Railways, If he will favourably consider the proposal to provide access to the Invercargill Railway - station from Spey Street, so as to enable residents in the north part of the town, Avenal, and North Invercargill to more readily obtain entrance to the railway-station. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) said the report he had was this : "It is considered that the residents of the northern part of Inver- cargill have already a very convenient approach to the railway-station along Leven and Dee Streets, and the department is strongly opposed to the granting of any additional access."

HOSPITAL NURSES' REGISTRATION BILL. IN COMMITTEE. Clause 5 .- "A certificate given after the pass- ing of this Act by the medical officer of any hospital shall not entitle the holder thereof to registration unless a course of at least twenty-five lectures has been delivered in that hospital in each of the three years' residence therein of the holder of the certificate, and unless the matron of the hospital is herself a registered nurse." Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) moved to strike out the words " twenty- five, and to insert in lieu thereof the word " twelve." Word struck out and "twelve " inserted. Mr. HALL-JONES moved to strike out the words " and unless the matron of the hospital is herself a registered nurse." Amendment agreed to, and clause as amended agreed to. Clause 8 .- " Any registered nurse who is con- victed of any indictable offence, or is proved to be guilty of misconduct, is liable to have her name erased from the register by order of the Governor in Council." Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister for Public Works) moved to strike out all words after "offence," and to insert, in lieu thereof, " shall have her name erased from the register by order of the Governor in Council ; and any registered nurse who is proved to the satis- faction of the Registrar and any Stipendiary Magistrate to have been guilty of grave mis- conduct shall be liable to have her name erased from the register by order of the Governor in Council." Amendment agreed to, and clause as amended agreed to. Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister for Public Works) moved the addition of the following new clause : - " For the purpose of enabling nurses who, previous to the coming into operation of this Act, hold certificates issued by any hospital au- thority, or who may have had not less than four years' experience as nurses, and who do not come within the foregoing provisions, to be registered under this Act, the Minister may make regulations prescribing the qualifications or form of examination required and the fee to be paid for the issue of a certificate which shall entitle the holder to registration under this . Act : "Provided that no such certificate shall be issued after the thirty-first day of December, , one thousand nine hundred and two. New clause agreed to. Mr. HUTCHESON (Wellington City) moved to add the following new clause :- " In all appointments of nurses in hospitals under the control of Boards constituted under 'The Hospitals and Charitable Institutions Act, 1885,' preference of employment in regard to future vacancies shall be given to registered nurses : Provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed to interfere with the employ- ment of probationer nurses in such institu- tions." New clause agreed to. Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister for Public Works) moved to add the following new clause :- "This Act shall come into operation on the first day of January, one thousand nine hundred and two." New clause added. Bill reported. LAND FOR SETTLEMENTS BILL. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said that subsection (3) of section 6 had been amended to read as follows :- " (3.) If the Governor determines not to pro- ceed with the purchase he shall forthwith give notice thereof to the claimant, and there- upon the restriction on the disposition of the land under subsection one hereof shall cease to have effect." His opinion was that that meant that there was no restriction as to time. An Hon. MENBER .- I do not think that is right. Mr. SEDDON said he was going to move to disagree with that. The House fixed it at twelve months, and he thought that was the right thing to do. He moved that the amendments made in subclause (1) of clause 8 be agreed to. He had promised the House in Committee that he would see that the machinery was pro- perly adjusted, and after consulting with Mr. Marchant, the Commissioner of Lands here. these were the suggestions he had made so as to make it workable. He said that, although there might be no classification under the head of "ordinary farms" or "run," you would have to group them, because there would be some large and some small tenants, and if a tenant took up a small section he could not possibly take up a large one. At any rate, these suggestions had been made, and he moved that they be agreed to. New subclause (3) was en- tirely at variance with what had been done in the House, and he moved that it be not agreed to. Clause 9 was now read to form part of sub- section (4) of clause 8. He moved that that be agreed to. In subclause (5) there required to be inserted before the word " Board " the word "Land," so as to make it " Land Board." Mem- bers would notice that throughout the piece " Board," " Board," " Board " occurred, but it should be " Land Board "; so far as the section dealing with applications was concerned. Then, new subclause (7), he moved, should be agreed to. Clause 13 he moved should be agreed to. and the new clause 14 take the place of the wording struck out of clause 13. He was advised that it would be better to strike out those words in clause 13, and simply to put in a new clause. The summing-up as to the amend- ments was this : Subclause (1) of section 6 to be agreed to. The amendments in subclause (3) of section 6 to be not agreed to. Subclause (3) of section 8 to be not agreed to. The amend- ments in subclause (1) of section 8 to be agreed to. The amendments in the 3rd subsection of 
<page:515>
in clause 9 to be so amended as to form part of clause 8, and also the amendments made in such section to be approved. New subclause (7) to be approved. The amendments made in clauses 12 and 13 agreed to, and the inser- tion of a new clause 14 to be agreed to. On the question, That the amendments made in subsection (3) of clause 6 be agreed to, Captain RUSSELL (Hawke's Bay) said that it appeared to him that the time in subsection (3) of clause 6 was too indefinite. He did not think they would do right unless they insisted upon a speedy determination as to purchasing or not. Under the Bill there was a date fixed for the commencement of official negotiations, and surely three months after that the Govern- ment ought to know whether they were going to proceed with the purchase or not. It was not right to keep this sword of Damocles over the heads of the owners of land indefinitely. Mr. SEDDON said they had six months' notice. Captain RUSSELL said it seemed a very hard case. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) said it seemed to him the alteration was necessary, because as it was the matter might be hung up for several years. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) agreed with the last speaker. When the Bill was before Committee he expressed the opinion that the period of twelve months was too long, but this was worse, because it provided for an indefinite period, or, at all events, until the Governor determined not to proceed with the purchase of the land, and that might be years after the negotiations commenced. The clauses were put seriatim, and all the amendments made agreed to, except those made in subclause (3) of clause 6, and the addition of a new subsection (3) to clause 8, which were disagreed to. Mr. SEDDON moved, That a message be sent to the Legislative Council setting out the clauses disagreed to. Motion agreed to. THE GOVERNMENT ADVANCES TO SETTLERS EXTENSION BILL. IN COMMITTEE. Clause 2 .- " In addition to the loans autho- rised to be raised under Part II. of the principal Act, it shall be lawful for the Governor in Council to raise under and for the purposes of that Act any sum or sums not exceeding in the aggregate the sum of two million pounds : "Provided that not more than one million pounds (inclusive of any portion of the loan authorised to be raised by the principal Act and which has not yet been raised) shall be raised in any financial year." Mr. SEDDON (Premier) moved, That "two million " be struck out, with the view of in- serting " one million " in lieu thereof. Motion to strike out words "two million" agreed to. " one million." Captain RUSSELL (Hawke's Bay) moved to insert " five hundred thousand." The Committee divided on the question, "That ' five hundred thousand ' be inserted." AYES, 14. Allen, J. Russell, W. R.

Firat Reading-Sire Horses imported by Govern- ment - Land for Settlements Act - Wellington Harbour Board Bill-Land for Settlements Bill. The Hon. the SPEAKER took the chair at half- past two o'clock. PRAYERS. FIRST READING. Gaming and Lotteries Bill. SIRE HORSES IMPORTED BY GOVERN- MENT The Hon. Mr. ORMOND .- I move, That there be laid on the table of the Council a return of the thoroughbred, draught, or other sire horses imported by the Government to present date. The return to give the total cost of each horse  landed in the colony, what class of stock each horse is imported to improve, where each horse is to be stationed during the ensuing stallion season, and the fce to be charged. I was induced to put this motion on the Paper in consequence of this : While I was lately on a visit to Christ- church, having heard a great deal down there about the animals which have been brought out here from England-sire horses-by the Govern- ment, I went to look at three of them which are there on view. I went with some persons who are supposed to be excellent judges of horses, and I know a little about such things myself ; but we were unable to think for what purpose these animals have been imported. They are a sort of nondescript-looking crea- tures, with no clear characteristics, and that is why I have put this motion on the Paper. Sir, I would like to know, and the people of Canterbury where these animals are would like to know, for what particular purpose they are intended-that is to say, what class of animal they are supposed to produce. The opinion of a great number of persons whom I saw was that the animals would not be of any use or service in New Zealand-that they were very in- ferior animals, and would not in any way tend to improve the breed of horses in New Zealand. I heard it said by a great number of good judges that if these animals were put up for sale at Tattersall's down there, or at any other place in the colony, they would not realise $25 apiece ; and I do not believe they would. In other words, they are animals which, if they had continue as sires, but would have been rendered of the neuter gender, so that they could not perpetuate their species. I am giving the opinion of a large number of experts. If that is so, it is a great pity. Sir, I am told that these animals cost some hundreds of pounds; and it is a great pity if we are doing this kind of thing, when we have in the colony any number of horses alongside which these creatures could not be put for an instant. You might have bought horses for $50 apiece in New Zealand far better than any of the three horses I myself saw. I do not know, nor do I think any one knows, how we have become engaged in this importation of horses. But I know this, from a little incident that happened to myself : that the Government are taking very great interest in this question. Rather an amusing little thing happened a little time ago. I noticed in the papers that a sire draught horse had been imported, and it was said to be a very fine animal. It was known by the name of Danger Signal. It was a Shire horse. Well, I am a breeder of draught horses, and have a number of mares of that class, and I thought that I would find out whether this horse was at the disposal of the public, and, if he was, I should like to have sent a first-class mare to him, and I made application accord- ingly. It was just after the session, when my honourable friend and his colleagues were fully engaged by their official duties. I made a written application to the department to know if it would be safe to send a mare down to this horse, and I got a very polite reply that the matter was not yet settled, but the Cabinet were going to be engaged shortly in determining how this animal was to be employed and the fee to be charged. My honourable friend has the onerous duty of conducting the business of this Council, and if his colleagues are similarly engaged, they must have very arduous duties without holding Cabinet Councils on such matters as this; and I should have thought that it would have been competent for the Minister in charge of the department to have decided this little matter. However, that shows the interest the Government are taking in this question. I desire to know what is to be done with these animals-there are a number of them, I believe. I should like to know what they cost, and I should like to know for what purpose they have been imported. An Hon. MEMBER .- What kind do you call them ? The Hon. Mr. ORMOND .- They are thorough- bred horses, I suppose. They are said to have pedigrees. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER. - I am astonished at the honourable member who has just spoken. We all admit his intimate know- ledge of the subject of the breeding of horses ; not only is that knowledge his forte, but probably it is his foible. But I defy any man to judge a horse when he has come fresh off a voyage. I remember myself- The Hon. Mr. ORMOND .- It is the best time. 
<page:517>
The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- Yes; but very often many people who think they are the best authorities are the most out in their judgment. I know many instances of that within my own experience, when those who thought they knew a great deal on the subject were entirely out in their judgment. And I think, as regards newly irported horses, that very often a wise man will say, "I will see how this horse winters," or " how it comes through the next season." Speaking from my own personal experience, I may say that I might have bought old Traducer, one of the finest horses in New Zealand, for $75, and I might have turned him out with a lot of up-country station mares. Fortunately for the horse's reputation, and for the sake of horse-breeding in the colony, I was not good enough to risk £75 myself. I required a mate, and my mate did not come up to time ; and so the transaction as regards Traducer fell through, and Traducer went into better hands. But I know of other cases. I am astonished at the suggestion of the honourable gentleman, that there should be anything wrong in the Govern- ment importing horses of a high character. The Hon. Mr. ORMOND .- I did not say so. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- Well, evi- dently the honourable gentleman has inspected three horses that he does not like. An Hon. MEMBER .- What is their political " colour " ? The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- I do not know what their colour is; but the honourable  gentleman must admit that it is a very laudable object to import into this colony a new strain of good blood. Will the honourable gentleman admit that ? The Hon. Mr. ORMOND .- It depends upon how they are selected. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- I will come to that presently. Will the honourable gentle- man admit that it is a good thing to import into this country a new strain of good blood ? We know that horse-stock is a great factor in our national development. Many of our horses have gone to South Africa for war purposes, and the Government want to be able to supply the market. I should like the honourable gentle- man to admit that, everything being equal, it is a very laudable object for the colony to import special strains of horse - stock from the Old Country, or from wherever we can get a good strain. As he remains silent, I assume that he admits that. The next point is, Did the Go- vernment take proper care in the selection of the animals ? Inasmuch as they employed the best man in their department to make the selec- tion, I maintain that every care was taken. Of course, any man may make a mistake, and I do not mind venturing my opinion against that of other people on certain matters with regard to horse-flesh. But because we may not agree as to the merits of a particular animal I would not say that a good purchase had not been made. All that I would say would be that the animal did not suit me. I do not think the honourable gentleman has proved anything, and the Government sees no reason why this return should not be given. I have no doubt it will satisfy the honourable gentleman that the Government has been attending to a very useful and important part of the agricultural economy of the country. Horse-breeding is a science; but it must be carefully attended to, and it does not do to leave too much to private enterprise. Take Canterbury, for instance, where the honourable gentleman, I understand, saw these horses : they have been imported into a district which is amply supplied with horse- stock ; but, taking the whole colony, I maintain that there are many districts where farmers require encouragement in the selection of their male stock. It is a very big question, and it. has been several times suggested - and I am not at all sure that it would not be a good thing-that the whole question of thoroughbred horses should not be considered from the point of view that prevails in other countries-that there should be premiums on animals that can pass a certain test; and perhaps we should even go further than that, and say that undesirable stallions and bulls should be absolutely prevented from propagating their kind. All these questions are very large, and I do not think it is encouraging to the Government, who have made a start in a new direction for proper reasons, that they should be attacked in this way, as if they had acquired a lot of inferior stallions. Any care that could be taken in connection with this matter has been taken by the Government. We had the oppor- tunity of employing one of the most experienced officers of the department in the purchase of these animals. He was going Home for another purpose, and so his services were made use of to purchase stud stock, and I do not think it is at all fair that his judgment should be challenged, as it apparently has been by the motion of the honourable gentleman. Motion agreed to. LAND FOR SETTLEMENTS ACT. INTERRUPTED DEBATE. The Hon. Mr. T. KELLY said, When the question was before the Council the previous day he was interrupted at four o'clock to enable the orders of the day to be proceeded with. He now desired simply to complete what he had commenced to say on that occasion, and would endeavour to be as brief as possible. The return asked for opened up a large ques- tion of the administration of those lands, and several members had spoken in that direction. On the whole, he approved of the Land for Settlements Act, inasmuch as it provided land for the landless, if it could be given to them so as to be profitably worked in farming and grazing operations; and he also approved of providing small sections of land for workmen's homes near the towns where they were em- ployed. As to the question of tenure, it had been asserted that people preferred the freehold to the lease in perpetuity ; but, to his mind, it depended entirely on the rate of interest charged. At the present time people could acquire Crown lands under the Land Act of 1892 much more cheaply by taking it under the terms of the 
<page:518>
lease in perpetuity than by purchasing for cash. Under the latter there were certain disabilities which operated to the disadvantage of the appli- cant who was not possessed of capital. The re- sult was that this class of applicants, when free to choose the tenure, preferred the lease in perpetuity, as the rent was lower than the freehold tenure. Those applicants, however, who were able to pay for the land preferred to secure a freehold tenure, although the interest charged was higher than under the lease in perpetuity. His experience on the Land Board was that the bulk of the people applied for land under the lease-in-perpetuity system. Applica- tions to get the right of purchase had not been very large in the past, but they were increasing. There was a very strong feeling in favour of the freehold by those who were able to pro- vide the cash. What he was most afraid of in connection with the land - for -settlements policy was that if the Government bought land at high rates, even if they were the market rates, in certain cases the result would be a loss to the colony. On certain classes of land it was almost impossible to pay 5 per cent , in addi- tion to making the necessary improvements to conduct farming operations. It appeared to him that it was no consolation to a man who was a tenant of the Crown, who was crushed by a high rent, if the Crown pressed him, to be told it was for the public good. The sense of oppression would remain. If he was pressed by a private individual he was in no worse position ; but if the Crown pressed him by fixing a high  rent it would soon become a question of public policy whether the rent of Crown tenants so situated should not be reduced, and necessarily lower the credit account of this fund. Then this difficulty arose : If the land had been let at, say, 10s. per acre, and the tenant could only pay 6s., who was to pay the difference ? It must come out of the Consolidated Fund in order to balance accounts. Unless care was taken in purchasing land great danger would ensue, because it was very certain that if men could not pay their rent and live-get a living-wage out of the land, so to speak -- there would be wholesale applications to Parliament for reductions of rent. That was inevitable. But if the freehold was given there would not be applications to reduce the price of the free- hold. That involved the colony in no respon- sibilities in regard to the future ; but in lands purchased from private persons by the State there was this danger : that, unless great care was taken, the fund under which the system was operated might sustain heavy loss. Those were the only observations he wished to make. This was only a return, and there was no occa- sion to go into the general policy of the subject. He, however, availed himself of the opportunity to lay before the Council his views in regard to the buying of land for settlement, and to urge that care should be taken in the purchase of such land, and that it was fit for the purpose of close settlement, and could be let at such rents as the tenant could afford to pay. The Hon. Mr. JONES said he had listened to the Hon. Mr. Ormond's jeremiad on this Hon. Mr. T. Kelly question with a certain amount of surprise. He began to wonder how many more times the honourable gentleman was to be shown that the land - for - settlements scheme had been a pronounced success. The honourable gentle- man felt somewhat annoyed because the infor- mation which he asked for in his return had not been supplied by the Government. It was fortunate, however, for the honourable gentle- man that he had not that information before him, because he was enabled to talk with greater freedom on the subject. He was not hampered by facts which would have been inconvenient to him in view of the tone of his speech. He said he approved of the Land for Settlements Act. He approved, that is to say, of the land-resumption policy ; and he also told us that he took part in making the measure a workable one. Then, he went on to condemn its most indispensable features, and he said that under the Act it was intended to take only agricultural land. The Hon. Mr. ORMOND .- I said mainly. The Hon. Mr. JONES said, Very well, he would accept the honourable gentleman's cor- rection. Now, the Act did not make any such restriction. The Act gave three classes of land which it was proposed to take. According to the interpretation clause, first-class land was agri- cultural land, second-class land was agricultural and pastoral land, and third-class land was land suitable for pastoral purposes only. As these lands were mentioned in the Act, they might assume that it was intended to take, as oppor- tunity offered, lands of these three classes. This was the measure which the honourable gentleman endeavoured to make workable. This was the measure which was passed, and which he said was workable. Yet he tells the Council and the country that it was never intended to take pastoral land, which the Act said was to be taken if necessary. But he would like to ask any honourable gentleman why the operations of the Act should be restricted purely to agricultural land. Why should we not take pastoral land, if necessity required that we should, as well as agricultural land ? Large estates usually contain land of several quali- ties, and it simply meant, if you did not take pastoral land, and took only the agricultural land, that you would take the eyes out of the properties, and that was what the honourable gentleman in 1894 denounced as unfair, and, he (Mr. Jones) thought, with very good reason too. He approved of the taking of the whole of an estate, unless the proprietor desired otherwise, so as not to leave a portion which might be useless to the owner. The Waikakahi Settle- ment, which was admitted to be one of the most satisfactory settlements yet made under the Act-not only by the honourable gentleman who spoke in moving the motion, but by people generally throughout the colony - consisted largely of pastoral land. The downs were all pastoral land. There were fourteen small grazing - runs on the Waikakahi Estate, and the settlers on these runs were some of the most prosperous settlers on the estate and in the colony; and yet, if the honourable 
<page:519>
have taken the estate at all, or he would have taken only that portion of the estate which was agricultural and omitted the pastoral. Then, there was Ardgowan, which was pronounced by many to be the most satisfactory settlement established under the Act. That was essentially pastoral in its character. If we were to be restricted to agricultural lands under the Land for Settlements Act, he could see that the cause of closer settlement-for it was not close settle- ment, as the honourable gentleman termed it yesterday, but closer settlement which was aimed at-would be seriously retarded. If the honourable gentleman gave them some reason why it was desirable that pastoral land should be exempted from the Act one might agree with him. But he gave no reason, and he (Mr. Jones) was sure that no reason could have occurred to any honourable gentleman who listened to his remarks. Surely it would be as beneficial to settle fifty persons on fifty thousand acres of pastoral land as it would be to settle fifty persons on ten thousand acres of agricultural land ; and the cost would be no greater, for it was a fallacy to suppose that it cost the country more to pur- chase and settle pastoral land than agricultural land. Even if they doubled the number of settlers which they had in this colony, by taking a big estate and cutting it into two, they would be doing a good thing for the colony. We should be making room for settlers on the land-for the colony was not so big that it could afford to have large estates-increasing the State revenue, and making New Zealand better all round for everybody concerned. Under the existing circumstances, it was generally ad- mitted, he thought, that grazing had become the mainstay of the colony. It certainly did not any longer pay to grow wheat. Oats had been boomed a little because of the trouble in South Africa ; but wheat had been at a terrible discount, and no farmer could possibly grow that cereal with the price of land so high, and at the market values ruling during the past few years. Then, the honourable gentleman said too much was given for Hatuma. Even if that were so, it seemed to him that it was not the fault of the Government. It had always been recognised by the Government that when they made up their mind to take land com- pulsorily they could not withdraw, but must pay any amount which the Arbitration Court decided should be paid for the land, and that was an honourable position to take up. But what occurred about Hatuma ? There was an outcry throughout the length and breadth of the colony, from a certain class of persons, when it was proposed to take the estate. The Government were invading the sacred realms of the pastoralist kings of Hawke's Bay, and there was a loud complaint that it was most unfair to take the land com- pulsorily simply at its actual value, and without making some compensation for the sentimental loss. Sentimental loss, forsooth, for the man who lived out of the colony-who was an absentee of the deepest dye, who had been with the colony, and who was not taking any of the legitimate responsibilities of a bona fide settler. So, if too much had been paid for Hatuma, the excess of cost must be attributed to those who insisted upon the principle that land should not be taken on its mere value for cultivation purposes, but that there should also be given a sentimental value. But he hoped that that estate had not been purchased at too high a price. He hoped the honourable mem- ber was just as wrong in making such a state- ment as he was when he spoke against the Cheviot Settlement. He had been reading some of the honourable gentleman's deliverances that day on the Cheviot Settlement, and he found that he disapproved of that, as he had disapproved of every act of resumption of land for settlement in New Zealand. Certainly, the owner from whom the Government bought the land seemed to have made money out of it.' The honourable gentleman said the climate was' too dry-that there was no water. Well, the rain fell upon the just and the unjust, and if it fell upon the just original proprietor, who had fattened on the proceeds from this estate and the colony whilst living abroad, surely the poor settler who took up a portion of the land would get his share of the beneficent provisions which were made by Providence. The honourable gentleman had told them that on Hatuma there were farms more than a square mile in extent. If it was wrong to make farms more than a square mile in extent, how much worse must it be to have estates consisting of many square miles occupied by one individual, and on which only sheep existed? Speaking with regard to the compulsory clauses, the honourable gentle- man said that there was an agitation now in Hawke's Bay for the resumption of large estates. That agitation had been long expected, and it had come at last. It was inevitable that the land of Hawke's Bay should not remain in large blocks any longer-that as colonisation advanced, and as these great pastoralists had performed their duties as pioneers, they would have to give way to the smaller settler. That, he thought, was a principle which had been gene- rally admitted even by the friends of the pasto- ralists ; but the honourable gentleman said that this agitation had been given nerve and force to by the compulsory clauses of the Act. Well, that was the warmest commendation of com- pulsion. What the honourable member meant was this: that if there had been no compulsion there would have been no agitation, and if there had been no agitation there would have been no taking of land for settlement in Hawke's Bay. The honourable member would rather see Hawke's Bay remain as it was than that it should be invaded by the smaller settler. But that was not the way in which the ordinary colonist regarded the situation. He (Mr. Jones) wanted to know why the compul- sory powers were deemed to be unfair? They certainly had not been used unfairly by the Government, or by those who had been appointed by the Government to administer the law. In every case where land had been 
<page:520>
for the land. The honourable gentleman con- tended that there was no necessity for com- pulsion because only two estates had been Did the taken - Ardgowan and Hatuma. honourable member forget what was said by Mr. Allan McLean when the Government pro- posed to take his land ? In effect he said this : " I might just as well let the land go, as I know you will compel me to part with it by-and-by if I do not do so now." Then, the honourable gentlemen went on to terrify the Council with the bogey of the freehold. That was another which had been made from prediction time immemorial, and which had not yet He did not think honourable come true. members need trouble their minds very much about that. If the people wanted the freehold let them have it, for they would get it whether members liked it or not, and they had a perfect right to get it if they wanted it. But there was no indication on the part of the people of pre- ference for the freehold. The indications were all the other way. When the land had been set apart by the Government on the lease-in- perpetuity tenure, and land had been offered by private individuals on easy terms and at low rates in order to dispose of it, what had been the result ? The Government land had been disposed of, whilst the other had not. That was what had been pointed out by the Hon. Mr. McLean, who said that since the Govern ment had been carrying on the work of closer settlement-since it had been buying estates and administering them-there had been no  chance at all for private persons to get rid of their lands. He (Mr. Jones) maintained that that, again, was a compliment to the policy of closer settlement under the Land for Settlements Act. There could be no ques- tion that the great pastoralist belonged to a dying race, and, of course, one felt somewhat melancholy when hearing their plaint-such a plaint as was uttered by their representative, the Hon. Mr. Ormond, yesterday. But one might just as well attempt to sweep the Atlantic back with a broom as to attempt to prevent settlement going on. It had started in the South and had swept up towards the North, and would carry all before it, in spite of anything that might be attempted to arrest its progress. Nor could he see why there should be any sore feeling on the part of those gentlemen who held large areas of pastoral land in Hawke's Bay, or elsewhere in the colony. In all ages of the world men had been called upon to sacrifice their own interests in the interests of the people at large. They would have the conso- lation, if they had no other, that they would get full value for any land they might have to surrender, and that they would be doing some solid good to the community in which they lived. The Hon. Mr. A. LEE SMITH said that the honourable gentleman who had brought for- ward that motion preferred a very strong ndictment against the land - for - settlements policy. There were three main counts : the Hon. Mr. Jones not been carried out as it was intended ; and the third was that he objected to the leasehold system. In somewhat vigorous language the honourable gentleman had illustrated his chief objection to the Act by referring to the com- pulsory acquisition of the Hatuma Estate, but he (Mr. Lee Smith) was not going to speak for one moment against the honourable gentleman in regard to the suitability of this estate for close settlement. In a few remarks he pro- posed to deal with the question from an entirely abstract point of view. The honourable gentle- man had argued very forcibly, and from his point of view very reasonably, that there was no necessity to employ compulsion. He had the history of the Hatuma case as an answer to the honourable gentleman, the truth of which he could not deny. The honourable gentle- man said, first of all, that the cost of the estate was too high ; secondly, he said that the land was quite unsuitable for settlement purposes ; and, thirdly, he said that plenty of suitable land could be obtained without using compulsion. And then he went on to say that he was quite certain, if the tenants of that estate had to pay interest on the roading of it in addition to that on the purchase cost, it would be far more than they could afford to pay. But there was an answer to that, which could be taken in one of two ways. They had been told, on what he believed to be good authority, that the owner of Hatuma had written to the Government offer- ing to buy back the estate, and, in addition, to pay the Government a large sum of money- namely, €60,000-as redemption money. That might be true or false ; he believed it was true. He would ask, What was the position ? The honourable gentleman argued that the price paid, plus the roading charges, would make the rent too high. His argument, therefore, that the estate would have been held at a profit to him for many years by that gentleman, and that it would not have been sold except for compulsion, was unreasonable and illogical. If the owner had rebought it at £60,000 of ransom, then it stood to reason that with the interest of this £60,000 added, the owner, or the tenants he might let it to, would be sitting at a still higher rent ; so that, if it was too dear now, where would the owner's profit be ? The honourable gentleman argued that there was no need for compulsion, and he brought into one of his arguments the question of senti- ment. He said that the owner, having had the place for a large number of years, did not want to part with it. Well, if this argument of the honourable gentleman was good in one case it was good in another. Surrounding that estate there must be a large number of young men, who were no doubt imbued with the same sentiments as the honourable gentleman said the owner possessed. Therefore, if they were going to pay for sentiment, he would ask, Why not apply the same principle in the case of the people surrounding the estate? If the argu- ment of the honourable gentleman held good. the result would be that they would have to 
<page:521>
and be compelled to go to some other province -where land could be got-simply because the sentiment of the Hatuma owner was to keep all his thousands of acres in his own hands, although he was an absentee from it for years past. He believed that Hawke's Bay was a very fine province, and a very desirable resi- dential place. Those having large estates there, while getting good incomes from their property, would still not abstract from the land the value that could be got by small settlement. Therefore, if the estate was capable of pro- ducing $20,000 a year, and the owner said that he would be content with £10,000, it would be disastrous to the State that that should be allowed to continue. This sort of policy was not what they wanted in the colonies. He would ask them to look at the census to see what had happened in Hawke's Bay. In 1896 the population was 34,038. The Hon. Mr. JONES .- That is not sheep. The Hon. Mr. A. LEE SMITH said he was . referring to the population. In 1901 it was 35,424, and, deducting the one from the other, they would find that the difference was only 1,386, which meant stagnation. Apply that ratio of increase to all the other provinces of New Zealand, and he would ask, Where would they be? The people would be driven out of the colony, and have to go to Australia or some- where else. He thought that he had shown that compulsion was necessary in Hawke's Bay. As to the argument that the Act had not been carried out as it was intended, there were plenty of young fellows who very likely had capital to buy sheep, and who had been brought up on stations and understood sheep. They probably thought they would be able to do far better in the occupation to which they had been trained than in agriculture. Therefore there was a certain demand on the part of those people for the sort of small run which the honourable gentleman objected to. The object and principle of the Act was to give all people a fair chance, and, if they were to give the small farmer an opportunity, why should they not also give an opportunity to the shepherd who had not been a farmer ? If there was reason in the one, so was there in the other. Then, coming to the question of the freehold, the honourable gentleman objected to the freehold. The Hon. Mr. ORMOND .- No. The Hon. Mr. A. LEE SMITH said he had inadvertently used the word "objected " -- the honourable gentleman wanted the freehold. Well, he need not say much more than to call attention to the fact that in Great Britain the small holders of land were always getting fewer, and that the large owners were gradually ab- sorbing the whole lot. Every now and again they had instances of large estates being cut up and sold, but in time it all came back again. Take the instance of a large estate in Yorkshire with which he was familiar : How was that made ? By the savings of the annual income year by year for buying every farm in the district which would be an advantage to the estate, and consequence was that prices were given for sec- tions of, say, fifty acres and over far beyond their value, for sentimental reasons. Then, take the case of Scotland, and they would find the same thing. Large owners were buying up the land. What would be the case in New Zealand, supposing they allowed the freehold ? A man with a wife and children wanted to divide his property. Naturally if the estate com- prised his whole assets it would have to be sold. Men in this colony got rich just the same as they did at Home, only in a lesser degree. A man with a small property died, and some rich man with an adjoining estate would most pro- bably buy that lot, so as to increase his hold- ing, and continue the process as often as oppor- tunities occurred. The result would be that in twenty years we would be back again to where the late Sir John Mckenzie started from. That was taking place in Britain - in Scotland - and had taken place in Ireland until laws were passed to induce the people to sell their land. There was no compulsory purchase in Ireland yet, but it would come, because some people would not sell. It was the same in New Zea- land. In some districts bad land was offered to the Government, but in many instances where the land was good the owners would not sell. A man might desire to hold land at a higher value than the Government could afford to give for settlement purposes ; and here sentiment came in. But if sentiment was applicable, and you should indulge the rich man to that extent, you should apply it to the whole of the com- munity, and that was the principle that com- pulsory purchase at valuation provided in the interest of the State. The Hon. Mr. BOLT would say a word or so in regard to this question of freehold. The Hon. Mr. Ormond pointed out that as the number of State tenants increased they would use their political influence to get the freehold. Well, next to State ownership of land he would be in favour of the freehold, and he would say that, if there was going to be freehold tenure, let there be nothing else but freehold tenure. There should then be no leases. He always found that honourable gentlemen like his friend the Hon. Mr. Ormond were not opposed to leasing ; they were only opposed to leasing by the State. The Hon. Mr. Ormond was in favour of the freehold. If they were to have the freehold, let them have the freehold only. Then where would we be? The interest of the mortgagee would be gone, and no man could hold land unless it was absolutely free. If they were to have the freehold in that sense, they would come as near to the principles of State ownership of land as they possibly could. He always found that gentlemen who contended for the freehold only contended against leasing by the State. They were quite prepared that they should lease the land themselves- and leasing was not an improper thing when private people did it-it only became improper when it was done by the State. Then, they were told by the honourable gentle- man that the public debt was increasing. So it 
<page:522>
another name. To a great extent it was simply taking the money of the State and lodging it in the hands of the local bodies and settlers throughout the colony, and purchasing estates with it. What did that mean ? What did it matter to the capitalist whether he held his wealth in gold or in proper securities? No man would think for one moment that he was doing an improper thing if he held his wealth in pro- per securities, and he would not say it was increasing his debt if he built a house worth £90,000 with borrowed money. If that house was worth $90,000 he had only transformed the form of his wealth. And that was the position to a great extent at the present time. A large amount of the increased public debt was simply a transference of the public wealth into another form. Now, the honourable gentleman pointed out that the State, in entering on this system of purchasing private lands for settlement, had interfered with the privilege of private people of putting their estates into the market them- selves. How was that? If they were anxious to put up their estates for sale, what was to pre- vent them doing it now? There was nothing to prevent men with large estates cutting up their properties and selling them-selling the freehold if they wished to. What, however, did they find? They found that not one of those gentlemen clamoured about putting their estates on to the market until the Government entered on the business. For years and years people were clamouring for land, but they could not get an inch of it. Large and valuable  estates were lying near the centres of popula- tion, and it was impossible for any one to get a single acre of them. He need only mention the districts around Timaru and Oamaru, but Oamaru especially, as being a part of the colony   to which that applied. Certainly he was not so well acquainted with the northern portion of the colony, and the speech of the honour. able member in moving the motion was centred mainly in the question of the settle- ment of Hawke's Bay. He did not know why the speech of the honourable member should have been centred in Hawke's Bay more than any other portion of the colony. He might say, at the same time, he was not opposed to the return asked for. He thought it would be better to have the return, and he would vote for it ; but why, when ask- ing for the return, the honourable member should deem it necessary to make an attack on the Land for Settlements Act he could not con- ceive. He thought that surely a return of this kind might be asked for without raising the question of the whole policy of the Govern- ment in regard to the settlement of the coun- try. When it was obtained, the return might warrant such a discussion, but at the present time it was premature. The question of land-values had been raised, but he did not know he need refer to that. Land-values were made up, of course, not exclusively from the soil or climate or from facilities for trans- port, but from all these combined ; and when it was said that land-values should be uniform Hon. Mr. Bolt uniformity would be obtained by in every case taking all these things into consideration. He would vote for the return, because he thought it might be useful in the future ; but he failed to see why so much should have been said in asking for it, and he thought a great deal of what had been said had been very little to the point. The Hon. Mr. SHRIMSKI said it seemed to him the moment the Hon. Mr. Ormond rose to make a statement or a speech it at once raised a storm. He thought the honourable gentleman deserved credit for what he had done in this matter ; and the manner in which the honourable gentleman had asked for the return was very explicit, straightforward, and upright. It was a return which ought to have been published long ago, and which, in con- sequence of its not having been furnished, had brought to the attention of the members of the Council and the Minister in charge in that Chamber the necessity for such a return being placed before the Council. Such a docu- ment was very much needed. With regard to the honourable gentleman's reference to the freehold, that had raised a storm in a teapot. The great apostle of the abolition of the free- hold -and he hoped honourable members would agree with him in this-did his best to prevent people acquiring freeholds, although he himself had acquired one, and that at the very time he was preventing other people from doing so. An Hon. MEMBER .- Who was that ? The Hon. Mr. SHRIMSKI .- The late Sir John McKenzie. An Hon. MEMBER .- No. The Hon. Mr. SHRIMSKI said, What about Bushy Park ? An Hon. MEMBER .- That is not bis freehold. The Hon. Mr. SHRIMSKI .- Whose is it ? An Hon. MEMBER .- His sons'. The Hon. Mr. SHRIMSKI said, That was a very nice excuse. He was not in the habit of interrupting any other honourable member when he was speaking. What he said was a fact. An Hon. MEMBER .- It is not a fact. The Hon. Mr. SHRIMSKI said that was the true position, and it was not right for a private individual to acquire the freehold, or to agree to his sons acquiring the freehold, when he at the same time attempted to prevent others acquir- ing it. He did not know whether he was rightly informed or not, but what he had stated was according to the information he had received. He might state, also, that a great authority in this colony-so he was informed-had sent to England £30,000 for the purpose of acquiring an estate there. It was very strange that all these gentlemen who had such objections to the freehold should yet themselves desire to obtain a freehold. An Hon. MEMBER .- Who was that ? The Hon. Mr. SHRIMSKI said he was not going to give the name. An Hon. MEMBER .- You cannot. The Hon. Mr. SHRIMSKI said he was in- 
<page:523>
was correct or not he could not say, but that was according to the information given to him. An Hon. MEMBER .- It is wrong. The Hon. Mr. SHRIMSKI said the honour- able gentleman seemed to be in the secrets of everybody, and he was not going to satisfy the honourable gentleman by giving the name. Time would prove whether he was right or wrong. but it was not for the honourable mem- ber to declare that he (Mr. Shrimski) was wrong. Then, the Hon. Mr. Bolt referred to Oamaru. He thought that settlement should take place there, and that the large estates should be cut up. There was no doubt that closer settlement should take place there. He (Mr. Shrimski) admitted that ; but since that settlement had taken place the population of the district had decreased, so where did the improvement come in? If the Government had done the proper thing they would have purchased land- which he had always recommended-and have cut it up and roaded it, and disposed of it on reason- able terms. That would have brought about true settlement of the land. But the cen- sus returns proved that the population of Oamaru was decreasing. It was all very well to say that they must not have the freehold, and that everything that pointed to that was bad. At the same time, as he had said before, they noticed that as soon as those who advo- cated the leasehold were in a position to acquire the freehold they did so. He was surprised at the manner in which the Hon. Mr. Ormond's motion had been received. He thought the Council ought to be thankful to the honourable gentleman for bringing this matter forward, because in doing so he would help to give honourable members information which they should be in possession of. The Hon. Mr. ORMOND wished to say only a few words in reply. He agreed that the remarks of the Minister were exceedingly temperate, and he trusted his remarks in reply would also be fair. He thought, however, that honourable gentleman entirely failed - as had also the Hon. Mr. Jones and the Hon. Mr. Lee Smith -to realise what his (Mr. Ormond's) conten- tions were. His objects in bringing forward this motion were: first, to get information which undoubtedly Parliament was entitled to, and which, therefore, he thought the Hon. the Minister was not wise in recommending the Council not to accede to, because it was infor- mation which all who had studied the subject must consider members were entitled to. But a practice was growing up in Parliament of refusing information, and that was not a de- sirable practice to follow. He was very glad to hear honourable members say that they would support him (Mr. Ormond) in getting this infor- mation. He never said that the land-for-settle- ment system should be confined to one class of land, as the Hon. Mr. Jones appeared to assume. He (Mr. Ormond) said that in the passing of the Land for Settlements Act, the main idea, and the great object of the originators of that Act, and the Minister himself who introduced settled, and that there would be in conjunction with that class of settlement some 'portions of pastoral land in the estates purchased. Of course, he knew that, as every practical man did. His honourable friend failed to answer his con- tention that the administration of the Land for Settlements Act right up to now had been, as far as he could estimate, three parts in the direc- of settling people upon small sheep-runs, and not in the direction of close settlement. And he (Mr. Ormond) contended that the administration had been unsatisfactory-that not only had agricultural settlement not gone on, but that that very important question, namely, the providing of land for the homes of artisans working in the towns, had been improperly disregarded. Next to nothing had been done in it at all. Those were his indictments, and they were perfectly plain and clear, and when read by honourable mem- bers and the people of the country they would be readily understood ; and they had not been answered. They would gradually have an insistence on the part of the people of the colony that this Land for Settlements Act should be administered in the way the people and Parliament intended. This would be one of the outcomes of the consideration that was now being given to the subject. The other main point that he wished to make clear was that when he instanced the Hatuma Estate he did so because he did not have the same know- ledge of the other properties in other parts of the colony that he had of that. What he wanted to show clearly was that, disagreeing as he did with the compulsory taking of pro- perties, the Government had acted unwisely in taking Hatuma. In other words, he maintained that they had bought at a price that was above what would permit of the profitable settlement of such an estate, and that Hatuma was not an estate suitable for close settlement. He showed that more than half of that estate had been let in fifteen blocks, averaging 868 acres each, and that each of those blocks had cost the colony £4,600, to which had to be added the cost of survey, roading, and other expenses. He said that in making that illustration he was clearly showing that any policy which was worked like that made it impossible to produce the results intended by the Land for Settlements Act. The intention of that Act was that the masses of the people should be benefited, not the few. His argument was that in that par- ticular instance the land could not be ad- ministered to advantage, and he had met with no contradiction which would be accepted as at all upsetting his premises. If he had had time, he would have liked to have gone into the question of the valuations. His argument was that the Government had recently, through their officers, very largely increased the valua- tions of property in Hawke's Bay, and that the outcome had been that they had had to pay for Hatuma, and that they would have to pay large prices for the other esates they had given notice of purchasing, and which, if taken, would mean an additional expenditure of $300,000 to £400,000. 
<page:524>
want to pay less than the value of properties. The Hon. Mr. ORMOND said that he was just coming to that. The Minister had started an entirely new doctrine. It had been held by other Ministers who had administered the Act that the State was not to lose-that they were to buy properties at prices at which they could be cut up and disposed of without loss to the State. The honourable gentleman now said that that was not the condition at all, but he . (Mr. Ormond) maintained that that was quite contrary to anything they had ever heard be- fore. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- What did the honourable gentleman say ? The Hon. Mr. ORMOND .- That more money will be paid by the State than it should pay. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER had said nothing of the kind. He would ask the honour- able gentleman to look up the report of his re- marks in Hansard. The proof was a very good one, and he did not correct it at all, except to insert one or two words and commas. He did not find in it anything to the effect imputed by the Hon. Mr. Ormond. The Hon. Mr. ORMOND thought the honour- able gentleman was mistaken. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER said that he had never said anything of the kind. The Hon. Mr. ORMOND said that the in- creased valuations of those properties would prevent the Government carrying out the system of settlement as it ought.  The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER said that what he had stated was that any Government would be most dishonest that endeavoured by means of low valuations to secure estates below their real value. The present Government had desired to have values raised to an even scale all over the colony. That had been found very necessary in Hawke's Bay. But, because they wanted to acquire estates there, they had never been afraid to face the fact that if they raised the values they would have to prepare to pay a fair value for any property acquired. The Hon. Mr. ORMOND said, What he stated, in dealing with the question of valuations, was for the purpose of showing that the proce- dure of the Government would be against the successful carrying - out of the land-for-settle- ments policy. He regretted the time did not permit- The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER said, If the honourable gentleman wanted to continue his remarks he had no doubt the Council would agree to his doing so. The Hon. Mr. ORMOND said, If time had permitted he would have gone into the question to prove the impossibility of those tenants in many cases paying the rentals under which they had rented their sections ; and that the Govern- ment was running the risk of spoiling the proper carrying-out of the land-for-settlements policy. But, as he did not want to miss the opportunity of having the motion put, he would take an- other opportunity of dealing with the question. Motion agreed to. On the question. That this Bill be read the third time, The Hon. Mr. BOLT said,-I cannot allow an opportunity such as this to pass without referring to the proposed action of the Welling- ton Harbour Board in relation to another work -I mean the work they are now carrying out at Oriental Bay. I understand it is proposed, after that work is completed, that they will allow boatsheds to be erected along the retaining-wall. I cannot allow that to pass without expressing my disapproval of such an act as that. Oriental Bay is probably one of the finest suburbs about Wellington, and I believe the work the Board is carrying out there will further beautify the place; and it seems to me extraordinary conduct that, after having completed a work such as this, they should practically destroy the whole beauty of the place by allowing boatsheds to be erected. Sometimes public bodies act very peculiarly in this respect. They seem to have no sense of the duty, decorum, or natural fitness of things in regard to questions of this kind. I will give an illustration. Any honourable member can go up the Terrace here, and they will see that the Corporation have put up large squares of zinc or iron bearing the letters "F.P.," and underneath them certain figures showing the distance in fect. These are indicators to show where the water-plugs in the street are to be found. There is nothing, to my mind, more unsightly than these plates, and the large block letters and figures on them are about as ugly as one can imagine. Some of them are even put on men's gates. The whole thing could have been done by simply having a small zinc disc bearing the figures on it, the letters not being required at all. If our Cor- poration in Dunedin had done such a thing as that they would have been laughed out of countenance. I say, moreover, it is a shame that the streets of Wellington should be half- paved. You go up the Terrace and you find one portion of the footpath paved and the other portion covered with blue shingle, which is continually rolling off the path and into the drains. It appears to me that if the Corpora- tion paved the streets and rated the owners for the cost of doing so they would be doing a proper thing, and would be beautifying the city immensely. I take this opportunity of protest- ing against the Harbour Board allowing boat- sheds to be erected on the foreshore I have referred to. The Hon. Mr. T. KELLY .- I quite agree that the local bodies in some places are desti- tute of all ideas of natural beauty, and have no regard for "sweetness and light." But it is not only the local bodies who are the offenders in that respect. I will instance the Public Works Department and the Railway Depart- ment as two shocking examples. I know of cases of this sort in Taranaki where natural beauty has been wantonly destroyed and the convenience of the public ignored. I have known the people to have remonstrated, and the Ministerial head simply says, "I am ad- vised so-and-so," and there is no remedy. 
<page:525>
The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- I do not think it is right to charge the Government or the local bodies with want of appreciation of the beautiful, or with vandalism, or whatever else you like to call it. I will not admit for a moment that other parts of the colony are any- thing like Wellington ; and I may say that the best part of the work done in this city has been done by the Government. Take Auckland, Napier, Christchurch, Dunedin, Invercargill- take many of our country towns from one end of the colony to the other -- most of the works there have been in the hands of the local bodies, others effected by specially directed associations. I can point to a lovely domain created out of land with very few natural advantages at Ashburton. The fact is that Wellington is, perhaps, an exception. But we have always given the Wel- lington Harbour Board credit for a certain amount of intelligence, and I hope they are not now going to cause us to change that good opinion. If it is going to take up the ways of the City Corporation I would recommend my honourable friend, before the Bill passes, to move that it be read this day six months, because I do not think we want to have another instance of Bumbledom in this city. I trust the warning which has been given will be sufficient ; but still I must say that I believe the most efficient warning would be to insert a clause which will prevent them doing that which we object to. The Harbour Board have done very well in the past, and I trust they will continue to do so. I do not see any reason why they should not maintain the position they have held in the past. But I could not sit silent, and hear local bodies and the Government abused for want of taste, when I know that the local bodies everywhere else except in Wellington, and the General Govern- ment everywhere, should certainly not have such a charge made against them. The Hon. Mr. JONES .- One would have thought that these were the dying hours of the session. The speeches made by honourable members have been like stonewall speeches, or like the verbal wanderings which you, Sir, tolerate when we are about to leave for home. The honourable gentleman who last spoke first of all started with the Wellington Harbour Board, and then travelled from Dan to Beer- sheba, or from China to Peru. Of course, I am bound to sympathize with those who denounce the streets of Wellington, and that is about all the reference I am going to make to the streets of Wellington just now. It is quite sufficient to say that they are bad, and about as bad as they could be. But we have always understood that the Wellington Harbour Board was an ex- ample to the whole colony-that it always per- formed its work well ; and not only have I heard that, but I have seen evidences of it with my own eyes. I hope the Wellington Harbour Board will do no such thing as it has been sug- gested they intend to do-erect boatsheds on the foreshore at Oriental Bay. Of course, as the honourable gentleman representing the Go- vernment said, it might be necessary to prevent that being done by putting a clause in the Bill. But I hope moral suasion will be sufficient in this case. The Hon. Mr. JENKINSON .- I think the protest that has been made by members of the Council and by the citizens of Wellington inter- ested in this matter will be sufficient to convince the Harbour Board that they are doing what is inimical to the best interests of the port and the city ; and I feel confident they will take the hint, and will proceed no further with the erec- tion of these boatsheds. If I thought they would not take the hint I would be very glad to move that the Bill be read the third time this day six months. If the intention to erect those sheds is persisted in, we shall probably have another Bill before this Council, in which an amendment might be inserted to the effect, as hinted by the Hon. the Minister, that the power of the Board in this respect will be taken away. As the matter now stood the Government could withhold permission to the Harbour Board to allow boatsheds to be built, and I think we can rely upon them seeing that the sheds are not put there. The Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON .- I only wish to say that I think that the Harbour Board can be trusted The Hon. Mr. JENKINSON .- Do you pro- mise that they will not allow those sheds to be built ? The Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON .- I will not pro- mise that they will or will not do anything of the kind, but I think they can be trusted not to put up anything objectionable. If, however, they propose to put up boatsheds, reference to the Governor in Council is necessary, and I think after what has been said the Government can be left to look after the beauties of the city. Bill read the third time. LAND FOR SETTLEMENTS BILL. On the question of the consideration of a message from the House of Representatives, disagreeing to certain amendments made in this Bill, The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER moved, That the Council do not insist on the amend- ments made by the Council in this Bill. They were purely the result of a misunderstanding between the Law Draftsman and himself as to the intention of certain alterations that were put in the Bill in the other House. The clauses had to be redrafted, and there was a misunder- standing in consequence. On the merits of the case, he did not think that the Council could object in any shape or form to striking out those amendments. In the first place, in clause 6, subclause (3), the House passed it- " If the Governor does not proceed with the purchase and the land is not acquired by him within twelve months after the date of the notice mentioned in the last preceding sub- section, then the restriction on the disposition of the land under that subsection shall cease to have effect." Everybody knew what that meant. It meant, if the purchase was not proceeded with, that twelve months after the commencement of the 
<page:526>
proceedings the restrictions should cease to have effect. The clause as passed by the Council read :- "If the Governor determines not to proceed with the purchase, he shall forthwith give notice thereof to the claimant, and thereupon the restriction on the disposition of the land under subsection one hereof shall cease to have effect." Finality was an essence of the contract. He hoped that the Council would not insist upon the amendment. An Hon. MEMBER .- Why not make it six months ? The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER said he thought twelve months was a fair term. As for the other amendment, he hoped the Council would not insist upon that either. It was the addition to a subclause to clause 8, as follows : " (3.) An applicant may apply in respect of more than one group or subdivision." The Council would remember that the intention of its amend- ments to the Bill was to make the procedure simpler, and to make applicants more certain of getting sections. Their endeavour had been to eliminate the element of chance as much as possible from the machinery of the whole thing. The subclause was put in by accident. The object of the Land for Settlements Act was to get settlers on the land who were able to work the blocks in a proper way. It was no use putting men on the land, simply because their names came out of the ballot-boxes, if they were not able to work it. The Land Boards had the power to find out whether they had got enough  32106019788246 cash to start. It would be absurd to say that a man should, out of speculation, be allowed to put in for a group which he would be unable to work. Things should be kept equal, and the sections properly settled by the right class of men. In fact, he thought it was giving a better opportunity to the right class of persons. He moved that the Council do not insist on the amendments. The Hon. Mr. T. KELLY said he thought they intended to improve the wording of the Bill, and to make clear the intention of the Act, and he therefore did not see any reason for insisting on the Council's amendments, which were ob- jected to by the House of Representatives. The Hon. Mr. McLEAN said he thought the amendments should be considered separately. He did not see much objection to the honour- able gentleman's proposal with regard to the last one ; but he would like to point out, with regard to the first amendment, that they might, he thought, get something between the subclause of the House and that of the Council suitable to both parties. He would ask, What object could the Government have in retaining for fourteen months-which was really the effect of the proposal - land which they never intended to take. The business should go through in two months ; and why should they give notice to take land if they did not mean to take it ? He would instance a case at Oamaru, in which the Government offered a certain price for land. Their price was refused, and the land was immediately put on the market and sold for Hon. Mr. W. C. Walker something like an average of £4 or £4 10s. an acre more than the Government offered. The whole estate was sold in farms before twelve months had elapsed. Could the Government have ever held an embargo like that proposed over the property for all that time, when the people wanted to sell it themselves in farms, and so save the Government the trouble ? Then, in the case of trustees, how would they administer an estate if this embargo was kept on it? Both Houses wanted to get at the same thing, and he thought the best way to do was to disagree with the first and agree with the second. and then the Bill could be amended. It was only a matter of the mode of doing it. They did not want to stop close settlement, but to get hold of the land as speedily as possible. The Hon. Mr. ORMOND quite agreed with the Minister that it was more advantageous to the owner of the land to have the amendment. than to have the clause as it was originally, and that fixity of terms was necessary. He thought the Hon. Mr. McLean must agree to that. It did seem unreasonable, however, that this should be held over for twelve months. He thought it might be altered to six months. That would be a reasonable compromise in the matter. What they should do was to disagree with the amendments and have a Conference. The Hon. Mr. PINKERTON said they should insist on the first amendment and agree with the second. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER asked if there was any amendment before the Council. The Hon. the SPEAKER said that none had been handed up to him. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER said he did not think there need be any trouble on this occasion. After all, what did this proposal of a twelve months embargo mean, in clause 6 ? It was only preventing persons making a disposi- tion of their property among their family. The Hon. Mr. McLEAN said there was another clause altogether. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER said he thought he was quite right. If honourable members would look at clause 6 they would see that it was as follows :- "In order to prevent any evasion or avoid- ance of the provisions of the principal Act as to the right of the owner to select and retain any limited part of any estate intended to be ac- quired under that Act, it is hereby declared that the area of the whole estate shall be computed as at the commencement of the negotiations for the purchase under the said Act, and no sub- sequent disposition of the estate, or any part thereof, shall operate to defeat the power of the Governor to acquire the land under that Act." They all knew that in certain cases individuals had avoided, or were supposed to have avoided. the intentions of the principal Act by sut- dividing or disposing of their property in such a way as to prevent the operation of the Act. The only question, then, was as to the length cf time which the property to be acquired was to 1 be under a condition of embargo. The Hon. Mr. McLEAN said it had got nothing to do with that. 
<page:527>
The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER said he thought it had. Once the Government said they would take up certain land, then the owners could not deal with it by subdivision or anything else until the Government released its grasp. . The Hon. Mr. McLEAN said they wanted the time for that to be fixed at six months. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER said he was prepared to argue that twelve months was very reasonable. As originally proposed the time was two years, and in the other House it was brought down to twelve months ; and he did not think the Council should insist on its amendments simply because they thought twelve months was too much. He therefore trusted that the Council would carry his motion, and not insist on its amendments. The Council divided. AYES, 17.

Mr. R. THOMPSON (Marsden) brought up the report of the Waste Lands Committee on the petition of John Old, to the effect that no new circumstances having arisen, the Committee recommended their former finding to the con- sideration of the Government. Mr. SYMES (Egmont) said this petitioner had been before the House three times. It was a case of particular hardship. This was a good and deserving settler, who went into the back blocks and took up land where no one thought of going before. The block had been in the possession of the Government since 1856, and this settler had gone there to hew out a home for himself and family, and, through the in- competence of the officials in Auckland, he had been deprived, not only of his land, but of a large sum of money expended in improvements. He and his family went on to this land, felled the bush, and carried grass-seed for twenty- three miles on their backs through bush, and up and down almost inaccessible hills. After all that-after he had been in possession and had the assurance of the officials in Auckland that he could have the land-without rhyme or reason he was deprived of it, and, not only that, but of his labour and the money he had put into it. The Committee, as members could see, saw the injustice that had been done, and recommended that the petitioner should be dealt with in a fair and equit- able manner ; and that, if he and the Go- vernment could not agree in the ordinary way, the case should be referred to arbitration. He thought he was correct in stating that the present Minister of Lands was one of the Waste Lands Committee who had reported on this case, so that he knew the whole of the facts. Some sort of bogey had been set up that he asked too large a sum. He had been asked to send in a claim ; but it would be hard to say the sum to which he was entitled, for there were few who would have liked to undergo the hardships he had gone through with his family. For a considerable time they had been unable to get horses up there, and everything had to be carried on their backs. He understood some time ago that the Government would favour- ably consider the matter with a view of settling it, but it had been put off from time to time, as all these deserving cases were, until the people got weary of bringing their cases before the House. It would be better for the Govern- ment to let people know at once that it was useless for any one to petition the House-that favourable recommendation from Committees would not receive consideration. He trusted something would be done in the way of having justice done to a most deserving settler, who had gone through a great deal of hardship, and who up to the present had not been fairly or justly treated. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) said, One would think, from the honourable gentleman's speech, that this was a very deserving case, and that the Government had deprived this man of his land, and given him neither money nor land in return. This showed the honourable gentle- 
<page:528>
man did not know the particulars of the case. He would tell him all about it. The facts were that there were about nine hundred acres of land taken up by the petitioner, and when he went to the Auckland Survey Office he asked some one in the office if the river was the boundary of the land, and he was told that it was the boundary. This officer was not the head of the department ; but upon this reply he took up this property, and went to work and cleared a piece of manuka scrub. He was told the land belonged to the Maoris, and was not Crown land. He, then, must have known it was not in the power of the Government to give him the land. That was the time he should either have thrown up his section or have demanded compensation. Mr. SYMES .- What about the plan it was sold by ? Mr. DUNCAN said he had taken the trouble to ride over the land in company with Mr. Old, who pointed out the ground, and that revealed to him that this portion in dispute-the land that belonged to the Maoris-was in a very short bend in the river, with a very nice portion of light bush, and the balance was manuka, light scrub. A small portion of this scrub was cut down, and that was all the improvements He was visible, that one could be certain of. prepared to do this : to take the value of both sections at the date he took them up, and deduct the 200 acres, and allow that to be the basis of settlement. That was the only way it could be done. The land was not the Govern- ment's to give ; it was Native land. He did not think it would be going too far to allow him the difference between the 200 and the 700 acres, and the Government were prepared to do that ; but if they gave him the amount he asked he would be getting the 700 acres for nothing. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) wished to say a few words, to indorse the remarks of the honourable member for Egmont and in reply to the Minister. Unfortunately he had not the advantage of being on the Waste Lands Committee, but he had had occasion to visit the Mahoenui district some time ago, and had heard the history of this matter not only from the petitioner but from other settlers in the district ; and he had come to the conclusion-in which he believed he was right-that it was an extremely hard case, and that the petitioner had suffered serious loss on account of a mistake made by the officers of the Survey Department, for which he thought the Government should be responsible. The history of the matter was briefly this: About 1892 the petitioner, Mr. Old, and some other settlers thought about taking up land in what was known as the Mahoenui Valley. They visited the district, and Mr. Old afterwards made application for a section, including what is known as the " Otaiao Bend." But before doing so they interviewed the Commissioner of Crown Lands on the matter, who, in answer to the following question put by one of the intending settlers : " Are we to understand that it is per- feetly clear that in selecting land here "-mean- ing the section in question-"we get a river Mr. Duncan frontage throughout, bend or no bend ?" replied " Yes." Mr. DUNCAN. - Mr Mueller was 3.0. never there at all. Mr. MASSEY said he was informed that it was the Acting Commissioner-at any rate it was the head of the department at the time. However, the petition of Mr. Old stated that he applied for the section to which he had referred, and he was successful in getting it, he being declared the lessee. After obtaining possession of the land, he put a number of men to work at clearing, sowing grass, and so forth. About that time he was invited to come down and sign his lease, and on doing so he discovered that the whole of his river frontage was cut off, and that the portion known as the Otaia Bend, which he had improved and which was far more valuable than the other part of the land, was not included. Of course he objected, and was informed by the Commissioner that he could choose one of two alternatives : he could either take up the land, sign the lease, and later on the Government would acquire the piece that had been cut off, and hand it over to him ; or he could surrender his lease and apply for compen- sation. Mr. Old decided to remain on his land if possible, in the hope that the Government would acquire the land in question, which included, as he had said, the whole river frontage and the greater part of his improvements, and river flats particularly suitable for agricultural purposes. The Government, however, had not acquired the land. On account of the loss of the frontage, Mr. Old had to buy some privately-owned land at a considerable advance in price ; then, feel- ing that he had been badly treated, he peti- tioned the House on three different occasions. The petitions were referred to the Waste Lands Committee, who, on each occasion, had gone thoroughly into the matter, and had reported that Mr. Old's claim ought to be considered, and that he ought to be compensated. Mr. Old did not want-as the Minister of Lands implied -anything unreasonable; he did not want to sit free for the remainder of the 999 years, but he asked that his case might be sub- mitted to arbitration. Mr. Old was a good settler ; he belonged to a family of good settlers, and who had done far more than their share of the work of pioneer settlement ; and he thought it was the duty of the Minister of Lands, who. in his (Mr. Massey's) opinion, was the one member of the Ministry who was amenable to reason, to see that justice was done to the peti- tioner. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said, One would think from this discussion that the Govern- ment were blameable in respect to the matter, and that it had come up now for the first time and had not received from the Ministry that attention it demanded. The late Sir John Mckenzie, when Minister of Lands, had gone into the matter very fully, and he certainly was not a man of whom it could be said that he was not amenable to reason. He was not a man who would do an injustice to any settler. He had gone fully into this matter, and he was prepared to go the length the present Minister 
<page:529>
As to the land in question, the question had been brought under his (Mr. Seddon's) notice by Mr. Old and his friends, who advocated that some relief should be given to the appli- cant ; and, as regarded what the member for Franklin had stated, as to the extensive nature of the improvements Mr. Old had made on the land, instead of their being as stated by the honourable gentleman, one man for six weeks could do all that had been done in the way of im- provements. The application had been before both the late Minister and the present Minister of Lands : and he might say that the Govern- ment were not prepared to allow people to force this colony or the Government into arbitration just as they liked ; and it was simply non- sensical to say that any person who had a grievance, either fancied or solid, should have the right to force the Government into arbitration on that question. It was for the Government to do what was just, right, and in the best interests of the colony. In this case the Minister of Lands had the solution of the matter, and he had practically a free hand in regard to it. Therefore, he did not see that there need be any talk about it. Of course, the member for the district, in bringing the matter up. wanted to let his constituents know that he was doing his duty. They therefore had this little " fare-up," and the member for Franklin was patting the honourable member for Egmont on the back. He had an object in doing so; but the Minister of Lands was the unfortunate man who had to do his duty, and they ought to leave him to do his duty. Mr. McGUIRE (Hawera) did not think it was right or just to treat Mr. Old in the way he had been treated. Even on the statement of the Premier the Government need not be afraid to submit this matter to arbitration. The ques- tion had been before the Waste Lands Com- mittee on several occasions, and, if it were such an insignificant matter as the Premier stated, he need not be afraid to send it to arbitration. If the (Government were not prepared to give petitioner fair consideration, and do what was just, the House ought to force the Government to do it by carrying a resolution to that effect. He trusted a resolution would be moved by the member for Egmont. No individual in the community should be allowed to suffer through the mistake of a Government department. Every consideration should be given, in his opinion, to the back-block settlers, who had hardships and difficulties to endure which many honourable members were not aware of, having no experience in the real work of settlement. In the interests of justice the matter ought to be referred to arbitration. If the case for the department was a good one the Government had nothing to fear, and, should the subject- matter be submitted to arbitration, the peti- tioner would not receive more than he was entitled to. He therefore trusted the Minister would submit what appeared to him to be both equitable and just. Mr. LANG (Waikato) said he very much regretted that the Premier should treat this VOL. CXVII .- 33. importance to the gentleman concerned. The Premier had stated that there were little or no improvements on the place ; whereas it had been proved that Mr. Old had spent £150 on improving the particular part of the property that had been referred to. Then, the Premier stated that the matter had been "looked into"; that was very little satisfaction to the petitioner, if something more substantial did not arise from it. This matter had been " looked into " now for two or three years, and yet the petitioner had received no com- pensation whatever, and the Government would not even allow the matter to be de. cided by arbitration. Now, he wished to indorse all that had been said by the honour- able member for Egmont, the honourable member for Franklin, and by the honourable member for Hawera. He happened to have known Mr. Old a good many years, and he had been several times on the property, and knew When Mr. all the particulars of the case. Old first thought of buying this property he believed there were no other settlers in the district at all. Mr. Old went down to the Land Office to make inquiries, and was shown a map of the property, and he, with another gentleman who was with him, pointed out to the Com- missioner that there was a certain bend in this river not shown on the map, and they asked if the land he was acquiring went right down to the river and had a river frontage. They were told distinctly more than once, that "the land went right down to the river, bend or no bend." He wanted to point out that Mr. Old purchased the property chiefly on account of the flat along the river, which consisted of 278 acres, and which was the pick of the whole block. With- out that land the block was worthless, so much so that when unfairly deprived of it, he had to purchase seven hundred acres from an adjoining neighbour in order to work the section properly. Mr. Old made the improvements already men- tioned : but, when the lease was made out and sent to him for signature, he found it had then been discovered that the land did not go down to the river, and he refused to sign the lease. The department admitted a mistake had been made, and told him he was entitled to compensation if he liked to throw up the land: or, if he liked to stick to the land, they would see that this portion was purchased from the Natives, and he could take it up at the same price at which he had ac- quired the rest of the block. Now, being a bond fide settler, and not wishing to make anything out of the Government by way of compensation, Mr. Old said if he got the land he would be quite satisfied. It was agreed that the depart- ment should purchase the land from the Na- tives, and, when purchased, he should have the first right to acquire it on the terms he (Mr. Lang) had just mentioned. During this time Mr. Old had several offers from the Natives to sell this land. The department, however, asked him not to interfere, and they told him the Government would purchase the whole block of 900 acres, and would give him this piece of land 
<page:530>
stead of purchasing direct from the Natives, as he might have done, Mr. Old said to them, "No; go to the Government." This land was given to some Natives who, he heard, had no real claim to it at all. Be that as it might, however, the land was handed to certain Natives, and Mr. Old was ordered to drive his stock off the place, and was compelled in con- sequence to buy another 700 acres of land. Now, the Committee did not deny the justice of the claim. Every member of the Com- mittee, and the late Sir John McKenzie, ad- mitted that ; and the present Minister of Lands admitted it, for when last year's reso- lution was carried by the Committee the Minister of Lands voted for it, showing that he approved of it. All that Mr. Old asked was that he should have the land given to him again, or, if not, that the matter should be settled by arbitration. There was nothing fairer than that; and surely the Government ought not to object to that, so that at least Mr. Old might get fair compensation. He thought, under the circumstances, that Mr. Old had been very unfairly treated by the Government allowing the matter to drag on year after year, and apparently putting every obstacle in the way of Mr. Old getting fair compensation. He thought that was the case, considering the attitude the Minister of Lands took in this matter, when he actually voted for this resolution, as shown in the Appendix to the Journals of the House for last year :- "I am directed to report that the Committee consider that a claim for consideration has been established, and that the extent of such con- sideration should be decided by arbitration, or such other way as the Government may decide, in the event of the Government being unable to secure the land to the petitioner." The petitioner would be much better satisfied if the land was handed back to him, but, if not, he asked that he should receive fair compensa- tion, and was willing to allow the matter to go to arbitration. He asked the Government in all fairness to allow it to go to arbitration. Mr. SEDDON said he had been misrepre- sented. The honourable member said he treated this matter lightly. He did nothing of the kind. What he did say, and what he did think, was that the honourable member for Franklin and the honourable member were attempting to make political capital out of this matter. Captain RUSSELL (Hawke's Bay) rose to a point of order. He said it was monstrous that the Premier should be allowed to get up and asperse his opponents on the ground of making & personal explanation. The Premier was intro- ducing new matter, and was attributing base motives to the honourable member for support- ing the report. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER said the Premier simply rose for the purpose of explaining that he had been misrepresented ; and he thought the Premier should confine himself to that statement. Mr. Lang matter lightly. He certainly attributed politi- cal motives, rightly or wrongly. That was what he actually said at the time, and the honourable member for Franklin proved he was correct now by disagreeing with him (Mr. Seddon) when he first made the statement. Mr. LANG said the explanation he wanted to make was in reference to the statement made by the Premier that this was a political matter, and that the member for Franklin and himself spoke on it purely on this ground. He wished to say that Mr. Old was never a constituent of his, and had never lived in any electorate be had the honour to represent, so that there was nothing in that way whatever. The reason he spoke about the matter was this: He visited the place on several occasions, and he knew that Mr. Old, as the member for Egmont had said, was one of the best pioneer settlers, and that he had put up with great hardships in the past in settling on this ground in the Awakino district. On that account, and because he (Mr. Lang) was a member of the Waste Lands Committee, before which the petition had come on several occasions, and considered Mr. Old had been unfairly treated he spoke as he did. Those were his only reasons for speaking. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) said he was entitled to a personal explanation. The Premier told the House a few minutes ago that the member for Franklin had brought this matter up with the object of making political capital out of it. He had no such object. He had indorsed the remarks of the honourable member for Egmont because he happened to be an old personal friend of Mr. Old, and he knew that he was a good settler, and that he had been treated badly by the Government, and he thought he was entitled to compensation. Mr. SYMES (Egmont) said the Hon. the Minister of Lands had endeavoured to mis- lead the House respecting this matter by saying that Mr. Old had never been in posses- sion of this land. He said, most undoubtedly, that Mr. Old was in possession of this land. The Minister also talked in a light and airy sort of way about the plan. Mr. Old was assured by the whole of the officials in the Land Office -they were the only people he could get the assurance from-that he was getting his land to the river. If that had not been the case he would never have looked at this land at all, because when the Government took away the river boundary they took away the whole frontage. Further than that, the officials in the Land Office in Auckland told Mr. Old to stick to this land, although the Natives threat- ened to turn him off. The Minister of Lands said that Mr. Old had never sown any grass- seed on it. The Minister must remember that when he saw the land, at the beginning of this year, some years had elapsed since Mr. Old had held possession of this land. The Maoris had had their cattle, horses, and pigs feeding on this land for years, until they had eaten the grass out of the ground. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) wished to explain his position. The petition that was 
<page:531>
sown or otherwise. He was on the land himself with Mr. Old, and saw the class of bush on it, and every word he had said about it was correct. One man could do all the work that had been done on it. He was sixty years of age himself, but he guaranteed he would have been able to do it all in ten or twelve weeks. He had offered to go into the matter with Mr. Old, and had given him the difference between the value of the class of land that belonged to the Maoris and the portion that was outside, about nine hundred acres, that he still held. He purchased it at about 7s. per acre all over ; but the com- pensation that he asked was nearly the sum paid for the whole property, so that he would have about seven hundred acres for nothing. He thought that was a little too much to expect him to do. Mr. A. L. D. FRASER (Napier) said, No doubt good would result from the debate that had taken place on the petition. He desired to say it was unjust to accuse the Government of neglecting many of the questions that were brought under their notice every year. As members were aware, a measure had been brought down for years known as the " Wash- ing-up Bill "-a Bill that was intended to do justice to individuals who laboured under disa- bilities. But who had prevented that measure from passing? It was not the Government, surely : it was the obstruction of honourable members. Last year, members met on Com- mittees day after day, with the object of inquir-  ing into certain petitions, and when the various matters had been looked into they were referred to the Government for consideration. Many of them were viewed favourably by the Govern-   ment, and, as a consequence, a Bill was drafted and introduced to the House, with the view to giving effect to these recommendations. The measure, however, as he had stated, was not passed. He would like to suggest to the Government that it would be advisable to have the "Washing-up Bill" brought in much carlier every session, instead of leaving it to the dying hours of a session, when every- body was anxious to leave Wellington and return to their homes. Last session some most important public matters were involved in the Bill. Injustice had been done to individuals, to corporations, and to other bodies of people in different parts of the colony, and without the necessary legislation no relief could be given to them. He would like to mention that on one Committee, of which he was a member, the most difficult matters of law and fact were in- troduced and considered by the Committee. This Committee sat day after day last session, and, although they brought down certain re- commendations to the Government, the measure which was intended to give effect to those resolutions was not carried by the House. In that Bill, too, there were petitions referred to that had been before the House for years. He would like to see the Governmont introduce the measure on the following day. The House would gladly deal with it. It would be much better in the interests of the country than if and Offices Bill, or some other retrograde mea- sure which would only result in injury to the colony. If the Government intended to do justice to Mr. Old, whose petition had been favourably reported on for three years, a clause should be inserted saying that the matter in dispute would be referred to two parties for decision, one to be nominated by Mr. Old, and the other by the Government. Mr. BOLLARD (Eden) would not have said anything in this debate if it had not been for the remarks of the last speaker. The state- ment the honourable member had made in defence of the Government was altogether in- correct. He had accused members, especially members on the Opposition side of the House, with blocking what he had been pleased to call the "Washing-up Bill" of last session. Now, as a matter of fact, the Government never brought that Bill down for second reading. The mea- sure was simply introduced ; it was carried no further, and the honourable member ought to have known that. For himself, he hoped the Bill would be introduced this session and put through. Mr. A. L. D. FRASER (Napier) wished to make a personal explanation. He did not say that the members of the Opposition obstructed the Bill last session. Indeed, he would admit at once that stonewalling was altogether un- known in the parliamentary experience of those honourable members; it was foreign to their He trusted the member for Eden nature. would accept the explanation. Mr. HOGG ( Masterton) said he agreed with the member for Napier in his remarks on the "Washing-up Bill." It was very desirable that the Bill should be brought doan earlier every session than it was. As for the Bill of last session, he believed it was something like charity: it covered a multitude of sins. and it was his intention to keenly scrutinise every Bill of that kind that was brought before the House in the future. It was, perhaps, a good thing for the country that last year's Bill was not allowed to pass into law. From some dis- closures that had since come to light, he re- garded it as a measure that would not bear inspection. With regard to Mr. Old s petition, he wished to say it had received a great deal of attention from the Waste Lands Committee on more than one occasion, and he thought if the applicant would only meet the Minister of Lands in a fair way, and endeavour to arrive at a reasonable compromise and not open his mouth too wide, the matter would cease to trouble the Committee or the House. Mr. MILLAR (Dunedin City) said he had been brought to his feet by the remarks of the honourable member for Napier. The honour- able gentlemen had suggested that the " Wash- ing-up Bill " of last session should be again introduced this session. Well, if it was intro- duced, he (Mr. Millar) intended to give it very close attention, because under the measure of last year an attempt was made to over-ride the statute law of the colony. He referred to a Bill that had this year been brought up as 
<page:532>
reported against, as it was not, in their opinion a local Bill. When the measure was before the House last session he accepted a lawyer's word on a certain matter that had reference to a block of land, the title of which had been granted under the New Zealand Company's charter. The land grant was issued in 1851. or thereabouts, to the person who was entitled to it, and in 1892 a Bill was passed through the House, which practically killed the whole of those old titles. It gave a certain 3.30. limited time in which all applications had to be made for this land, and if these claims were not made within that time, that land should revert back to the Crown. In 1894 the Bill was further amended- Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER could not allow this discussion to go on. The honourable member must confine himself to the subject before the House, and not discuss the provi- sions of another Bill. Mr. MILLAR said, All he had to observe was that if there was any attempt to bring in clauses of that description again it would not be successful, if he could help it. In regard to this particular case which had come from the Committee, he would want fuller information regarding it before he would support it. There was no doubt there was a deliberate attempt on the part of a large number of people in this colony to simply rob the Government, by forcing these matters to arbitration. When any of these cases arose and the matter was forced to arbitration, the tendency was to look on the Government as an individual with a very long purse, and in nine cases out of ten the arbitration went against the Government. An Hon. MEMBER .- What about the Midland #cc-zero Railway ? Mr MILLAR said the case of the Midland Railway was fortunately an exception, in which the arbitration went in favour of the Govern- ment ; but it could not go in any other way, because the evidence was so overwhelmingly in favour of the Government that no arbitrator could have come to any other conclusion than that which was arrived at. Of course, the honourable gentleman was now raising a ques- tion that he could not debate at the present time, in connection with the debenture-holders and shareholders of that company, but no doubt at another time they would have the opportunity of discussing that question. On the particular matter just now engaging the attention of the House, whether or not a ques- tion of compensation should be referred to arbitration, he himself believed the Government would not do an injustice to any one in a ques- tion about land. The advantage had been on the other side altogether. There had been any amount of these cases in the House since he had been a member of it where, over and over again, it had been shown that the Government had been "had " in connection with the land where the matter had gone to arbitration. An Hon. MEMBER .- Not in the North. Mr. MILLAR said, Yes, in the North Island as well as in the South Island. He sincerely Mr. Millar selves to be put in that position again. He regretted that Mr. Deputy-Speaker had ruled that he could not deal with the other matter to which he had referred, because it was a very important one ; but, no doubt, an opportunity would be presented in the financial debate to bring the matter before the House, because he thought if the Government by a side-wind like that attempted to over-ride the statute law, the House should know it. What was more, if any further " Washing-up Bill " came before them, he would require the fullest explanation before he would be an assenting party to its going through ; and he might say, if there was any- thing doubtful about it, and there were half a dozen members of his way of thinking, it would not go through that session. Mr. R. THOMPSON (Marsden) said, Coming back again to the petition of John Old, he would like to say a few words This petition had been before the Waste Lands Committee for three successive sessions, and the Committee had recommended that the petitioner should be paid fair and reasonable compensation. He (Mr. Thompson) believed that if it had not been for the action of some of Mr. Old's friends in this House the whole matter would have been settled before now. Correspondence was laid before the Committee this year which showed, to his mind, plainly, that Mr. Old's friends in this House had done him a deal of harm. An Hon. MEMBER. - Whom do you refer to ? Mr. R. THOMPSON said, No one in particu- lar. Mr. Old had been foolish enough, owing to the encouragement he got from some members of the House, to place himself in the hands of a solicitor, and that solicitor had made demand, on the Government which he (Mr Thompson) said the Government would not be justified in agreeing to. If Mr. Old had been left to him- self, and been allowed to deal directly with the Minister of Lands, who went up and visited the place when he was in the district, he believed the matter would have been settled : but, to judge by the letters read this year before the Committee from the solicitor, he said the Go- vernment would not be justified in agreeing to his demands and submitting the case to arbi- tration. He had no hesitation in saving, from what he knew of the case, if Mr. Old had not been led away by the advice tendered by some of his friends in this House, but had kept away from the solicitors and had dealt directly with the Minister of Lands, there was no doubt whatever that justice would have been done to him, and he would have got fair and reason- able compensation. Motion agreed to. # WORKERS' COMPENSATION FOR ACCIDENTS ACT. Mr. FLATMAN (Geraldine) asked the Pre- mier, If he will consider the advisability of amending " The Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act, 1900," with the object of making it clear as to whether all workers within the colony come under the provisions of and are in- cluded in that Act? This was an important 
<page:533>
question to the country, and one on which various opinions had been given. He thought the majority of the opinions were that the agriculturists were included in "The Workers' Compenstion for Accidents Act, 1900." He was rather of opinion that he would get an answer from the Premier to the contrary ; but he might say that he had a legal opinion, that although the farm labourer might not come under the Act, still, at the same time, farmers were liable for all contractors who worked on their farms. Now, he thought that the Act should be amended and made clear, so that every agriculturist and pastoralist would have the opportunity of providing for That was why he accidents by insurance. asked the question. He had no objection him- self to agricultural labourers coming under the provisions of the Act ; in fact, he thought it would be a very good thing, provided that em- ployers could get a covering rate in accordance with the risk, which was not the case now with the Government Accident Insurance, at least, who were charging the farmers three times as much as they should do at present. He trusted the Premier would see his way to make this clear to the country, so that the country-people might understand the position they were in relative to the workers in their employ. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) understood the honourable gentleman had told the House that he had received a legal opinion that the agri- cultural labourers were not included in the Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act. Mr. FLATMAN said the legal opinion was that it was not clear as to whether agricultural labourers came under the Act or not, but that, at any rate, farmers were liable for all con- tractors that worked for them. Mr. SEDDON said, That was exactly the position. The opinion was that it was not clear whether or not they came within the scope of the Act ; but the advice the Govern- ment had got was that it was clear they did not. Of course they would be told, If there was a doubt, why not remove it. He was going to show why. They had in New Zealand a tran- script of the Imperial Workmen's Compensa- tion Act. An Hon. MEMBER .- NO. Mr. SEDDON said that with respect to this matter the law was the same. He had himself had charge of the Bill, and had given instruc- tions for the drafting of it, and was responsible for it, and surely ought to know better than the honourable gentleman. The Act was in this respect, at all events, a transcript of the Imperial Act; and what did they find ? They found that in the House of Commons a Bill had been introduced extending the Workmen's Claims for Compensation Act to the agricultural labourer. For that purpose a special Act had been introduced. Therefore, if our Act was a transcript of the English Act' in this re- spect, and it was necessary in the Mother- country to pass an Act of Parliament to extend the Act to agricultural labourers, it would re- quire an Act of Parliament here to do the same thing. That, of course, was his contention. If the intention of the Legislature upon this ques- tion had been thwarted - if they had gone fur- ther than they had intended, then it was their place to see that that was rectified. There might be an opinion that the agricultural labourer should be included, and some might think they should let it remain so; but his answer to that was that they ought to keep good faith, and that this had not been intended when the Act passed. Mr. TANNER .- Oh, yes, we did intend it. Mr. SEDDON said the honourable gentleman might have intended that, but he (the Premier) had not done so. Then, what was it that had raised this matter, and had caused all the fric- tion. It was the insurance agents, and he was told even the Government Insurance agents had gone this far : that, with the view of promoting business, they had created a scare, and that they had gone to the farmers and had got them to insure. Was the Legislature, because in- terested companies got up a scare of this sort, to legislate ? If, he repeated, the present law applied to agricultural labourers, he would be the first man to bring down a Bill and to say, If you want to make it apply, do so ; but it was not so intended. An Hon. MEMBER .- Some of the best lawyers in the country say it does. Mr. SEDDON said .- Well, " when in doubt, play trumps," and the trump-card in this case, he supposed, would be to await a Supreme Court decision or introduce a Bill ; and the might introduce one, but they could not at present get it through. However, as he had said, on being satisfied that what the insurance companies alleged was true, it would be the duty of the Government to try and alter it. Parliament ought to come to some decision upon it. . An Hon. MEMBER .- Take it to the Supreme Court. Mr. SEDDON did not know whether they could do that ; at all events, he would see if that could be done. Then, there was the other point, that the farmers were responsible for the contractors. If the law made the contractor responsible, that was right; for he had the machine, the engine, and was the employer, and should be held responsible ; but it would be manifestly unfair that the farmer whose stack would be threshed out in two or three days should be liable to be mulcted in damages amounting to $300 or £400. That would be unjust ; and if the law was such, then they ought to make that right, and to make it clearly so. The man who had the machine and who employed the work- men was the man who ought to be responsible for the workmen : but, that the farmer who brought the machine into his place for a few days should be responsible was wrong, and had never been intended by the Legislature. He thought if they allowed matters to take their course they would find out that he was not asleep, but that he knew what he was doing. He would watch the thing carefully, and if he could be satisfied that there was doubt it should be rectified. What was wanted was to give the country confidence that the Legislature would 
<page:534>
not do what was unjust to any section of the community. Mr. FLATMAN would like the Premier to assure the House that he would endeavour to make it clear before the end of the session, so that there need be no further anxiety regard- ing it. Mr. SEDDON said he had already obtained advice upon the question, and he would take further advice respecting it, and his future action would depend upon that advice. If it was the case that a scare had been created by self-seeking and interested persons, for the purpose of getting business, what he wanted to do was to get hold of those men, because they were really getting money by means of false pretences - by frightening farmers into insur- ance by saying that the law was so-and-so, was, he thought, getting money under false pre- tences. There was a good deal of that going on ; and it was impossible, under the existing law, for what they said to occur. Mr. MASSEY said the farmers were afraid to employ outside labour in case of accidents happening for which they would be held re- sponsible. # CONCILIATION BOARDS. Mr. COLLINS ( Christchurch City) asked the Minister of Labour, If in his remarks " that Conciliation Boards sat too much, and were doing the thing to death," he included the Canterbury Board in such remarks? His object was not to question the justice of the  honourable gentleman's remarks, but to narrow their application Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said he had said what he had with a due sense of responsibility, and with a desire to check what appeared to him to be an unsatisfactory condition of things. He had said the other day it was not so much the Conciliation Boards which were at fault as the law we had given them to work. WINTER RAILWAY-EXCURSION FARES. Mr. McGUIRE (Hawera) asked the Minister for Railways, Whether he will issue cheap ex- cursion tickets in the winter months, to extend over three months, thus allowing the farming community an opportunity of travelling at ex- cursion fares, as under existing conditions they are debarred from taking advantage of those in operation ? He was satisfied it was the desire of the Minister to do even justice to all sec- tions of the community. Farmers and agricul- tural labourers had no opportunity of taking advantage of the summer excursions, and he thought the Minister would be acting in the true interests of the community if he insti- tuted excursions during the winter- time for the farmers and their employés, as " All work and no play made Jack a dull boy." He hoped to receive a favourable answer. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) said no class was more deserving of consideration than the farming class ; but very heavy con- cessions had been already made in passenger fares during the last twelve months or so, and the excursion fares were now among the cheapest Nr. Seddon in the world. If anything could be done in the future in this direction he would be prepared to consider it, but nothing immediate could be done in view of the magnitude of recent con- cessions. FREIGHT ON COCOANUT OIL-CAKE. Mr. CARNCROSS (Taieri) asked the Minister for Railways, If he will so amend the railway charges as to permit of cocoanut oil-cake, used for feeding dairy cattle, being carried at the same rates as are charged for linseed oil-cake ? This was a question of some importance to agriculture. At present linseed oil-cake, used for feeding dairy cattle, was carried over the railways at a reason- able rate, whereas cocoanut oil-cake, imported from New South Wales, which was used for the same purpose, was charged 100 per cent. more. He understood it was the policy of the railways to encourage locally-made articles by cheapening the freight thereon, but he would point out that the locally-made article was already highly pro- tected through the Customs. At any rate, they should do all they could to assist the dairy in- dustry, which was acknowledged to be of such vast importance to this country; and this con- cession would only mean a small sum to the department, while it meant something con siderable to the farmer. He hoped the Minister at the head of the Railway Department would give this subject his favourable consideration. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) said the department did not differentiate be- tween cocoanut oil-cake and linseed oil-cake. Oil-cake, not otherwise specified - that was. imported oil-cake of any kind-was charged at Class D, the lowest merchandise rate in the tariff. New-Zealand-made oil-cake was charged Class E. That was in accordance with the general practice of the department to make concessions in favour of local industries. The same arrangement applied to native coal, which was charged at a less rate than the imported coal. He would, however, be glad to look into the matter and confer with the honourable gentleman. ACCOMMODATION FOR PASSENGERS ON SOUTHERN TRAINS. Mr. ARNOLD (Dunedin City) asked the Minister for Railways, If he will,-(1) Haston on the work of upholstering the seats in all second-class carriages running to and from Dunedin ; (2) have lavatories fitted to all first- and second-class carriages on the said lines : and (3) place a dining-car on the Dunedin- Invercargill express? The Minister deserved every credit for the improvements he had made on the railways during the last two or three years. In regard to the first part of the question, there were already a large number of carriages htted up, and these were very much appreciated ; and he thought the department should issue 'instructions to have the whole of the second-class carriages fitted up in the same way. In connection with the second part of the question, there was considerable incon- venience felt by second-class passengers, esper cially on long journeys, as from Christchurch 
<page:535>
gard to the dining-car, it must be admitted the accommodation at Clinton was second to none in New Zealand ; but a large number of passen- gers preferred dining-cars, and he thought there should be a dining-car between Dunedin and Invercargill. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) said the equipment of second-class carriages in the way indicated was being proceeded with as fast as circumstances would permit, and there were 237 so equipped, which were now being used on all trains ; the rest would be completed as soon as possible. In regard to the second part of the question, he was surprised to hear that there was any complaint about lavatory accommoda- tion on the through trains, as it was provided on all trains, though not in every carriage. On no railway service in any part of the world was there such accommodation in every carriage, nor was it the intention of the Government to provide it in every carriage; but sufficient lavatory accommodation would be put on all the trains, and on long-distance trains it was intended that there should be sufficient accommodation of the kind provided for the whole of the passengers ; and a proper system of gangways were in course of construc- 4.0. tion between each carriage, so that people could go from one carriage to another as they desired. In this respect no inconvenience could be experienced by the travelling public. If there were such conveniences in every car, as the honourable gentleman indicated, the seating accommodation in the cars would be consider- ably diminished, more cars would require to be put on, and the trains would consequently be heavier to haul ; the trains would possibly be delayed, and, as the honourable gentleman knew, punctuality of running was a feature of the New Zealand railways, and the trains kept to their time unless under extraordinary circum- stances. With regard to the third part of the question, the express service referred to was, as the honourable gentleman knew, one of the fastest in the colony, and the time had been considerably shortened during the last few years. That to some extent minimised the necessity that previously existed for having a dining-car on that train. Before the extra accommodation was provided at Clinton, he gave instructions to have dining cars built for both these express trains ; but, in view of other pressing works being required, and the accom- modation on the line in question being now very good, he had ordered the construction of the cars to be suspended for a time, until more important works had been carried out. The matter had not been lost sight of, and the time would come when dining-cars would be placed on the express trains there as in other places. # HILLSIDE WORKSHOPS. Mr. ARNOLD (Dunedin City) asked the Minister for Railways, When he contemplates establishing an iron-foundry at the Hillside Workshops ? He trusted that the Minister would be able to answer this question as satisfactorily as the last. Both at Petone and Christchurch foundries, and one had been promised at Hill- side. He thought it was quite two years since the promise was made. The Hillside Workshop was fully equal, if not superior, to any in New Zealand, and he trusted that the Minister would give instructions that an iron-foundry should be established there as soon as possible. The Minister would recognise the importance of the Government so equipping the various workshops that they would be able to do every part of their own work. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) said that a foundry would be established at Hillside when funds were available for the purpose, but at present funds were not available. A great many other things had to be done throughout the colony, and he would be exceedingly glad, when funds were provided for this work, to give instructions to have it put in hand at once. # RAILWAY CONCESSIONS TO TELE- GRAPH LINEMEN. Mr. G. J. SMITH (Christchurch City) asked the Postmaster - General, Whether he will arrange for the telegraph-line constructors to have a monthly concession on railway-fares, on the same basis as the employés of the Railway Department, so as to enable them to visit their homes if they so desire ? He understood that the employés in the Railway Department were entitled to a reduction in fares once a fortnight if they wished to go to their homes. The men employed on the telegraph construction - line gangs sometimes did not get home for five or six months, and at present they got no con- cession at all over the railways. This seemed to be a hardship, and he trusted the Minister would be able to arrange that some concession could be given to the men he had indicated. Sir J. G. WARD (Postmaster-General) said if it were possible to give effect to the honourable member's desire he should be very pleased to do so, but a concession of this sort could not be given to one department unless it was given to the whole Civil Service. An Hon. MEMBER .- Why to the Railways ? Sir J. G. WARD said that railway employés all over the world were allowed certain privileges as part and parcel of their employment ; but if the Railway service were to be taken as a guide and precedent for giving concessions to the whole Civil Service, then he was exceedingly sorry that what the honourable gentleman asked could not be done. He had no feeling against them on the matter; on the contrary, he would gladly do it if he could ; but, the num- bers of the Civil Service being so great, to make concessions of the kind suggested would mean that the outside public generally would expect to receive e qual concessions, and, logically, they ought to receive in such matters as much con- sideration as members of the Civil Service. Mr. G. J. SMITH said these men who were working on the telegraph construction gangs were away from their homes doing Government work, and some concession should be given to them if they wished to visit their homes once a month. They had a better claim to this than 
<page:536>
home. Sir J. G. WARD said he was entirely with the honourable gentleman, but officers of other branches of the service would regard their right as being equally as strong as that of the men whose claim the honourable gentleman was advocating. There must be some principle on which the Railway Department was adminis- tered ; and to make concessions in favour of one body of men as far as railway-fares was concerned would not be right unless it was granted to every employé in the Civil Service. Such a precedent if made to one section would be very hard to resist, and it would require to be done for all ; and, as he said, the general public had to be considered, and if such concessions were given they were as much entitled to them as any one else. The Postal-Telegraph Depart- ment could not be expected to put the money upon the estimates to provide for the payment to the Railway Department of the fares of these men by way of the concession suggested by the honourable gentleman, and that was the only way it could be done. KAIKORA NORTH RAILWAY-STATION. Captain RUSSELL (Hawke's Bay) asked the Minister for Railways, Whether he will cause a verandah or shelter of some kind to be erected at the railway-station, Kaikora North, for the convenience of passengers waiting the arrival of the trains? At this station there was a great want of shelter for persons waiting for the train. The station served the convenience of a  large country district as well as the town, and persons had to travel considerable distances to meet the trains at the station, and the conse- quence was that they had not infrequently to wait in rainy weather without shelter, because the small amount of shelter at the station was often filled up by goods which were landed on the passenger-platform and stored there. On many occasions he had seen persons on the platform absolutely unable to get shelter from the southerly rain, and therefore the work was a necessity. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) said the passenger traffic at Kaikora was very small, and he was informed the station was well pro vided for in the matter of shelter by the vesti- bule, which was a good and suitable one ; and, in view of the necessity of more pressing works being provided, he was unable in the meantime to give a promise that a verandah would be erected. If there were funds available for the pressing works of the colony, and something in excess of that for less pressing works, this appli- cation could be then taken into favourable con- sideration. # HASTINGS RAILWAY-STATION. Captain RUSSELL (Hawke's Bay) asked the Minister for Railways, If he will cause a crane to be sent to Hastings Railway-station to facili- tate the loading and unloading of heavy pack- ages of goods, which arrive and are despatched in large numbers, particularly during the spring and summer months? He hoped the colony Mr. G. J. Smith was unable to provide a crane for the unloading and loading of goods at this station. At present heavy packages of machinery had to be handled without proper appliances for lifting, and were thereby liable to injury, and he hoped this small expenditure will not be beyond the reach of the department. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) thought, with the honourable gentleman, that a crane was a very desirable thing to have at this station, in order to lift the heavy goods, and he would give instructions for one to be placed there. ROLLING-STOCK FOR WAIKATO LINE. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) asked the Minister for Railways, If he will have the building of a sufficient number of railway- trucks put in hand at the Railway Workshops. Newmarket, to provide for the expanding trade on the Waikato line ? He would point out that trade on the Waikato line had increased con- siderably of late, and he was informed that there had been a deficiency of trucks not only in connection with the Taupiri Coal-mines, but in other directions, to the inconvenience and loss of the trading community. He hoped the Minister would see his way to have the building of an increased number of trucks placed in hand in the Newmarket Workshops at an early date. Of course, he knew that the Minister was doing his utmost to increase the rolling-stock of the railways throughout the country, and that Rome was not built in a day : still he would be glad to have a favourable answer to this question. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) said the following new rolling-stock had already been authorised to be built at the Newmarket Work- shops for the Auckland Section-namely, four bogie brake-vans, three horse-boxes, ten cattle- trucks, fifteen sheep-trucks, five covered goods- vans, seventy-six 7-ton iron highside wagons, twenty-five lowside wagons, five timber-trucks, two bogie sheep-trucks, and two bogie cattle- trucks ; total, 147 vehicles. This work would be sufficient to keep the Newmarket shops fully employed for a considerable time to come. # MERCER RAILWAY-STATION. Mr. LANG (Waikato) asked the Minister for Railways, When the refreshment-rooms at the Mercer Railway - station will be completed ? The railway-station at Mercer was destroyed by fire about the 23rd December last, and even if the utmost speed was used in building the station it would probably be nearly twelve months from the time of the fire before the refreshment-rooms were rebuilt. The public had suffered a good deal of inconvenience on account of not having a proper station and refreshment-room at an important station like this, where trains so often stopped for refresh- The lessee had done everything in his ments. power to provide for the wants of the travelling public, who, even in spite of that, had been put to great inconvenience. He hoped the Minister would see his way to have the new station erected as early as possible. 
<page:537>
it was expected that the new station would be finished in about three months. He might point out that after the railway-station was burnt down the lessee was offered by the de- partment, at the expense of the department, to have temporary refreshment-rooms erected on the old site, but the lessee declined, for what reason he did not know. The delay in com- mencing rebuilding was to some extent due to a local agitation which was made to induce the department to erect the railway - station upon the old site. As the old site was close to the railway tunnel, it was not desirable from a traffic point of view, even apart from the score of danger to those who required to use the station premises for shunting and so on, to re- erect on the old site, and it was felt to be incumbent to select another and lighter place. But, as he was always ready to hear the repre- sentations of those who took an opposite view from the department, it took a considerable time before the agitation reached a definite point ; and, after inquiry, he declined the re- quest to keep to the old site, and they were then in a position to go on with the new station. That agitation was responsible-he did not, of course, say improperly - for some delay in commencing the work. # TELEGRAPH MESSENGERS. Mr. G. J. SMITH (Christchurch City) asked the Postmaster - General,-(1) What are the hours during which telegraph messengers are on duty; (2) whether all messengers have to take their share of night-work in the delivery of messages ; and (3) how many messengers doing such night-work are under the age of fourteen years ? Sir J. G. WARD (Postmaster-General) said telegraph messengers' duties averaged from seven to eight hours a day, in shifts, between about eight a.m. and midnight. At Wellington, however, the hours might extend until two a.m. during the session, whenever the House sat up to that hour. Night duty was taken by all messengers in turn. There were twelve boys under fourteen employed as messengers at offices which kept open till midnight. Where they did night duty they were as a rule released before midnight, and at Wellington at nine p.m. and ten p.m. He might tell the honourable member that only last year he increased the maximum age for telegraph messenger - boys from fifteen to sixteen. That was in order to get, if possible, older boys, between the ages of thirteen and sixteen, to take up this class of work. The older boys would, however, be put on the night duty generally for the future. MAORI NAMES OF RAILWAY-STATIONS. Mr. E. G. ALLEN (Waikouaiti) asked the Minister for Railways, If he will send a com- petent Maori scholar to report on the correct- ness or otherwise of the spelling of Native names of railway-stations in the colony, and have any errors corrected that may be found to exist ? Owing to a want of knowledge of the Maori language many of the names of railway- - an instance of two or three in the district he represented. He was informed that Waitati should be " Waititi," and Purakanui should be " Purakaunui." Again, Waihola should be "Waihora," and so forth. These wrongly spelt names were apt to be perpetuated if not corrected soon, and he would like to see the Native names of our railway-stations preserved correctly. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) said he was quite in accord with the views the honourable member had just expressed. He would like to point out that in 1900 he replied in a similar direction, and then stated that the names of the different stations had been re- ferred to two Maori scholars, one each in the North and South Islands, with the object of having these names correctly spelt. He was sorry to say that so far neither of them had sent in their corrections to the department. On former occasions he had given utterance to views similar to those the honourable mem- ber had just given expression to. He thought the names ought to be corrected. He had a list of several stations in different parts of the colony where the names were incorrectly spelt. Mr. Percy Smith, to whom the North Island names were referred, was at the pre- sent time in the islands, as honourable members knew ; and on the other hand his friend, Mr. Parata, the member for the Southern Maori Dis- trict, had very kindly promised to assist him in obtaining correction of certain names in the South Island He should be very glad indeed to have the matter expedited both in the north and south, and in the absence of Mr. Percy Smith, he would try and select some officer who had sufficient knowledge of the Maori language to assist in having the names put right throughout the colony. Mr. HOGG might be allowed to suggest a member of the House who would be thoroughly competent to correct these names-the member for Manawatu, Mr. Stevens. ## OEO POINT LIGHTHOUSE. Mr. McGUIRE (Hawera) asked the Minister of Marine,-(1) If he will favourably consider the advisability of having a lighthouse erected in or near Oeo ; (2) if a lighthouse is considered too expensive to maintain, will he, without de- lay, have a bell-buoy erected similar to the one at Nelson Harbour ? He regretted there should be any necessity to ask this question. There was no doubt as to its importance. If a light- house had been erected at Veo the loss of life that had taken place lately would probably not have happened. It was now only six years, and four vessels had been lost at the same point, and also twelve valuable lives. Steps should be taken without delay to prevent a recurrence of such a shocking catastrophe in future. He therefore trusted that the Minister of Marine, in the interests of the shipping people and in the interests of poor humanity, would see that something was done in the direction his question indicated, and that without delay. 
<page:538>
the attention of the department had not been drawn to the necessity for a lighthouse at Oeo Point until the recent wreck there of the " Lizzie Bell." He was very doubtful, even had there been a lighthouse there, if the loss of this vessel would have been averted, because there was the vessel supposed to be going in one direction, and afterwards found to have gone in a totally different direction. However, he was not done with that matter yet. Un- fortunately, his Nautical Adviser was at present indisposed, and he had not had an opportunity of consulting him on the question now under reply ; but, with reference to substituting for a lighthouse a bell-buoy, similar to that at Nelson, he was very doubtful if it could be done, seeing the difference in the circumstances. At Nelson the water was comparatively smooth, but on the West Coast there were often very heavy seas. But his attention having been drawn by the honourable member, and also by the Assessors who sat on the recent inquiry, to this matter, he would make inquiries to see if something could be done to avoid a recurrence of such a fatality as that which occurred re- cently. LUNATIC ASYLUM ATTENDANTS' PAY. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) asked the Government, Whether they will consider the advisability of increasing the pay of attendants at the lunatic asylums throughout the colony, in accordance with the recommendations of the officers in charge of such asylums ? Every per-  son, whether a member of the House or not, would admit that great care was necessary in the selection of persons to fill the positions of attendants in the lunatic asylums of the colony, and he must say that, as a rule, a first-class set of men had been appointed in the past. It was, of course, desirable that a high state of efficiency should be maintained, and it followed that, unless the Government dealt more liberally with the attendants than they did at present, the staffs of the asylums would become so de- pleted that the institutions and the patients must suffer. He did not pretend to an exact knowledge of what qualities were required in an attendant, but he held in his hand an admirable letter written to one of the Wellington papers, signed " Ex-Attendant," in . hich the writer, in these words, described the hours of labour and the duties performed by attendants at lunatic asylums :- "The average duty is thirteen hours per day ; dance duty, once a fortnight, two hours extra. Leave consists of three days per month, in- cluding one Sunday, and thirty days' annual leave after each year's service. The only other time allowed for recreation is every alternate evening after duty, from 6 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. ; in the case of married men, from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m. I believe the Act referring to asylum staffs says that one full day's leave shall be given every fortnight. A full day in any other part of the world means twenty-four hours-in the institution referred to it means twelve hours ; and all this for the paltry sum of $70 a and found. An attendant may reach £80 by an annual rise of £5; and charge attendants, of whom there are three, may reach $100 by the same annual rise. A simple calculation of the above facts will prove that each member of the staff works over ten hours and fifty minutes per day for 365 days in the year, even after allowing for all leave. The conditions of labour being so much more favourable outside, men will not stay long under the above conditions, and the patients suffer thereby, as their require- ments cannot be attended to by an ever- changing staff." The whole pith of the argument was that the efficiency of the asylums of the colony could not be maintained, and the exact wants of the patients attended to, where there was, as the writer put it, an "ever-changing staff." That was the actual ground of complaint-that the hours were extremely long, and the pay sur- prisingly small. This, of all subjects, was one that ought to receive the generous attention of the Government, for the case was not over- stated ; and he would like to hear the honour- able gentleman say that he felt himself in a position to announce that a change would be made, and that the Government would not only shorten the hours of labour, but would also increase the rate of pay. Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) said the question of the payment to, and the hours of, attendants at the lunatic asylums was now receiving the attention of the Government. In the estimates, as the honour- able member would see, there was an increase provided for the artisan attendants-they were mostly artisan attendants - and the clerks. With regard to the payment, it had also to be taken into consideration what the attendants received in addition to the amounts mentioned by the honourable member. A male attendant started at $70, and worked up by annual increases of $5 per annum to $80. He received his board, lodging, washing, and uniform, and he had equal to a total of some sixty-eight holidays each year, in addition to the evenings they were allowed when off duty. One mouth holiday leave was granted each year, and this, of course, included the days of twenty-four hours referred to by the honourable member. The matter of hours he did not like. To his mind the number of hours worked per day were too many; but it was well known to all who visited these institutions that the attendants had not hard or arduous work to perform ; but he thought it was not wise to keep them on for the long hours for which they had been kept on hitherto. Of course, any alteration mado in the hours of work would affect the holiday leave of the attend- ants, and some attendants had informed him that they would prefer their present hours, leave every year, and the days off that were allowed at the present timo, rather than shorter hours and a less number of holidays in the year. The questions of pay and hours were, however, under the consideration of the Government at the present time. He might 
<page:539>
hours day in the institutions instead of the present hours, it would mean the large in- crease in cost of £6,500; as more hands would be required for the extra attendance. Of course, in any steps the Government took they would consider at the same time what was desirable in the best interests of the in- mates of the institutions. Mr. FISHER said it was a little unfair to say that the board, lodging, washing, et cetera, formed an addition to the pay. That was a hard, stereotyped, official, and, might he say, a narrow view to take of the matter. The honour- able gentleman said the work was not hard. He (Mr. Fisher) knew men who after a year or two were very glad to get away from it. There was a rule in the asylums-he said this subject to correction-to the effect that if an attendant were dismissed, even after years of service, he received no retiring allowance ; but that if he were retired, or retired voluntarily, he might receive a retiring-allowance ; but if he left the asylum in opposition to the wish of the Superintendent he was cut off from any hope of receiving a retiring-allowance. If the Go- vernment were about to review the whole mat- ter, as the honourable gentleman said, that question should also be taken into considera- tion. He knew one attendant named Power who wished to retire after three years, having had enough of the work. Dr. MacGregor wished to retain him, but rather than remain in the service he abandoned his retiring-allow- ance. Mr. HALL - JONES said the honourable gentleman expected that board, lodging, wash- ing. and uniform should not be taken into account in considering a man's salary. Surely it was only businesslike that such things should be considered. As far as the lightness of the work was concerned, he did not say it was light, but, at any rate, it was not hard ; but he admitted it was trying to those who undertook the duties. The question of retiring- 4.30. allowance would be considered at the same time as the other questions. # RAILWAY-WORKS. Mr. COLLINS (Christchurch City) asked the Minister for Public Works, How it is that 81 artisans and 1,062 labourers are employed on the North Island Main Trunk Railway-line, while only 18 artisans and 404 labourers are employed on the Midland Railway, 9 artisans and 248 labourers on the Blenheim-Waipara line, and 86 artisans and 484 labourers on the Otago Central line? Honourable members would be aware that a very large amount of influence had recently been brought to bear on the Public Works Department with the object of compelling that department to make more strenuous efforts in regard to the completion of the North Island Main Trunk Railway. He did not in the least degree oppose these efforts, and he would like, as much perhaps as honour- able members representing northern electo- rates, to see that railway completed ; but he just wished to draw the Minister's atten- there were within fifty as many artisans and labourers employed on the North Island Main Trunk line as were employed on the combined Central Otago, the Midland Railway, and the Waipara-Blenheim line. And, while he had no desire to interfere with the works on the North Island Main Trunk line, he did think it was his duty to see that in the working of that line the other lines were not correspondingly neglected in regard to the number of men who ought to be employed upon them. As he had just pointed out, the number at work upon the North Island Main Trunk line was within fifty of the total number employed on the other three lines to which he had referred ; and he wished also to emphasize the necessity of the Waipara-Blen- heim line. He would ask the head of the department how it was that there was such disparity in the number of labourers and artisans that were employed on these respective lines, and to urge the necessity of a greater number being employed on the completion particularly of the Waipara-Blenheim line. Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) said the matter was of very easy ex- planation. The honourable member was no doubt aware that the sums voted for these respective works were: North Island Main Trunk Railway, $130,000 ; Midland Railway, $100,000-that meant on the Canterbury side, the West Coast side, and the section in hand from Nelson ; Otago Central, $100,000; and $50,000 was set apart for the Waipara-Blen- heim, and the greater part of this £50,000 was being spent at the southern end. There was another thing to be considered : how many men could be employed on the various works advantageously. They might have large sums of money voted, but it must be used to the best advantage. It was the duty of the Goverment, with the money at their disposal, to carry on the works in an economical manner. It was this latter course the Government were following. Now, take the Midland Railway : On the Can- terbury side they had a section about six miles in length, a work which the honourable gentle- man had some knowledge of. And when he knew-perhaps he did know-that nearly the whole of the men employed on the Midland Rail- way were employed on this very section, he must admit that that work, at any rate, was fully manned, and he thought it would be unwise to place any more men there unless there was scope for them to be advantageously employed. Then, as regarded the North Island Main Trunk line, the large majority of the members of the House approved of a greater number of men being employed upon that work, because it was recognised this work should, as far as practicable, be completed within a reasonable time. There was one section fifteen miles long at the northern end which consisted of fairly easy formation. At the same time, it was inadvisable to have works extending over too great a length, as the cost of cartage for the materials required added considerably to the cost of the work. Then, take the Otago Central, the same remarks applied there. They had 
<page:540>
bridges, and they were therefore limited as to the number of men that could be placed on the work, and it would not be economy to place more men there than could be advantageously em- ployed. On the Waipara - Blenheim line they were making very good progress with the work. Taking the three lines the honourable gentle- man had indicated for contrast with the North Island Main Trunk line, honourable members would agree with him (Mr. Hall-Jones) that they were all receiving a very fair share of consideration, and men had been placed there with judgment, having regard to the work to be done and the amount allocated for those works. # GISBORNE ANCHORAGE. Mr. COLLINS (Christchurch City) asked the Minister of Marine, If he is aware that on the 20th May last the "Tokomaru " struck bottom when anchoring in Poverty Bay off Gisborne, and that on the 27th July the "Tomoana " struck bottom when anchoring in the same place ? Also, if any inquiry was held regarding these two cases; and have any steps been taken to acquaint the seafaring community with the danger attendant upon anchoring in the locality referred to ; and, if not, why not ? There was, perhaps, now less necessity for asking this ques- tion than a few days ago ; but at the same time he would like to receive some assurance from the Minister of Marine that steps had been taken to protect the seafaring community from the dangers attendant upon anchoring in the roadstead referred to. Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister of Marine) said the matters referred to were the " Tokomaru " and the "Tomoana." With regard to the "Tokomaru," there was an inquiry into that matter. It was reported to the department as merely a vibration of the ship - simply a trembling motion felt on board-and when soundings were taken the depth of water was found to be 7 fathoms, with a muddy bottom. As regarded the case of the "Tomoana," an inquiry was held by the Collector, as the cir- cumstances were more serious, and it was evident there was some unknown danger in the roadstead at Gisborne. Steps were at once taken to locate that danger, so that further trouble might be avoided. The master of the vessel was informed that a Magisterial inquiry would be held if he so desired, but nothing further could be adduced. The "Tutanckai was sent to determine the position of the rocks. This was done, and the exact position was noti- tied in the Gazette. # UNOFFICIAL PASSENGERS ON GOVERN. MENT STEAMERS. Mr. (i. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton) asked the Minister of Marine, What are the terms upon which passengers not on official business are carried on a Government steamer, so far as paying for food and other creature comforts are concerned ? Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister of Marine) said the inquiry was as to the terms upon which passengers not on official business were carried Mr. Hall- Jones what was meant by "creature comforts." If it was what were commonly called refreshments. then they were paid for on board at the ordinary rates, no matter who had them. With regard to the charge for passengers carried on Govern- ment steamers, such officers and wives were charged at the rate of 7s. 6d. a day, and children under fourteen at half-price. Members of Par- liament came under this condition. Other per- sons were charged at the rates charged on coastal steamers, with the exception of the West Coast Sounds or the Kermadecs, or the Auckland or Bounty Islands ; where there was no regular service they were charged at the rate of 10s. a day. Those were the official charges for those desiring to travel. He might say that these more than covered the cost of board, the cost of board being not much over 2s. a day for each person travelling. # MAKOHINE VIADUCT. Mr. FIELD (Otaki) asked the Minister for Public Works, How many men are at present em- ployed on the Makohine Viaduct, and whether he can now give information as to the approxi- mate date of its completion ? This question had already been asked more than once this session, and it might seem rather persistent to ask it again. But he had been requested by certain people in the city and district to repeat the question, and so he asked the Hon. the Minis- ter, if he did not mind, to make another defi- nite statement on the subject. Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) said he had already intimated to the House on two occasions that he hoped to have the train running over the Makohine Viaduct during the course of the coming summer, and he saw no reason to doubt that that statement would prove correct. As to the number of men employed on the Makohine Viaduct- there were others employed on the Mangaweka Viaduct -- the number employed on the Mako- hine viaduct on Monday last was ninety-six. # LUNATIC ASYLUM EMPLOYÉS. Mr. HOGG (Masterton), for Mr. Morrison (Caversham), asked the Government, If they will take steps during this session, by legisla tion or otherwise, to put a stop to the long hours at present worked by the employés in our lunatic asylums ? He had been requested to put this question, and to explain that the attendants at lunatic asylums appeared to be by no means satisfied with the treatment ac- corded to them, both with reference to wages and hours of labour. They represented that they had no opportunity of forming a trades- union, and that they could not take advantage of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and so regulate their hours and the conditions of their employment. They com- prised about three hundred of the public ser- vants, and they contended that their duties were very irksome, monotonous, and mentally laborious. From a schedule that had been submitted he found that their hours of duty varied from twelve to fifteen per day, and that 
<page:541>
months of the year. They stated that by an increased expenditure of £13,580, in providing considerable additions to the staffs, the time on duty might be reduced to eight hours per day : and they suggested that five Superintendents who are now in receipt of about $6,000 a year might have their services dispensed with, and Boards of Control might be instituted in their place. In the opinion of some of the attendants the Boards of Control would be a very good substitute. Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) said that the last remark-that there were five Superintendents, costing €6,000-was entirely new to him. The salaries of the Super- intendents of the large asylums did not exceed $600, and that would not make up the amount mentioned. Mr. HOGG might explain that he had made a slight mistake : the representation was that about ₺6,000 a year was spent in the salaries and upkeep of five Superintendents. Mr. HALL-JONES said he supposed that also included the Inspector-General. He had replied a short time ago to a question put by the honour- able member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) on this subject, but he must confess the honour- able member who had put the question had not been so candid as the honourable member for Wellington City, for he had stated that the atten- dants had few holidays during eleven months of the year. Well, the honourable member must know that the twelfth month, which he had not taken into account, was the holiday month, and there were not many officials in the public "service, or employés in private service, who got a full month of holidays in the year. Then, in addition to this, the attendants had a day every fortnight, and they had certain Sundays, and also several evenings each week from six o'clock, or very shortly after, until ten o'clock. So far as holidays were concerned, he thought they were about as liberally treated as any one in the employ of the State. As to salaries, he was inclined to think there were some cases where an adjustment might be made. How- ever, female attendants received $40 and rising to #50, with board, lodging, and washing : male attendants received #70 increasing to €80, and as most of them were artizans and had a know- ledge of some trade, perhaps that was too little, especially for those who were married. With regard to the hours, they were not so long as had been stated by the honourable member. The hours in summer were from six in the morning till six in the evening, and there, of course, were intervals for meals, and every alter- nate day he believed they put in an hour or two longer. It was all a question of pounds, shillings, and pence - of providing an extra number of attendants and the additional ac- commodation for them, so as to enable an eight- hours day to be adopted. At any rate, he did consider that the hours at present worked were too long, and that they should be altered. He believed it would give far greater satisfaction to the attendants if the hours were lessened instead of the salary being increased. This partment. KAIKOURA FISH INDUSTRY. Mr. MEREDITH (Ashley) asked the Minis- ter of Marine, Whether, in the event of the steam-trawler " Doto," or any other trawler, being employed by the Government to ascer- tain the haunts of fish off the coast, he will arrange that the coast from the Amuri Bluff to the mouth of the Clarence River be tested, and thereby assist the development of the fish in- dustry at Kaikoura? Several of his constitu- ents in the Kaikoura district were interested in the fish industry. A fish-curing industry had been established there for the last fifteen or twenty years, and he had been desired to bring under the notice of the Minister of Marine the fact that when the trawler "Doto " was upon the coast examining the haunts of fish, that part of the district somehow or other seemed to have been overlooked. He asked the Minister, in the event of this trawler being again em- ployed, or any other vessel of a similar nature being called into this service, he would be good enough to see to it, that from Amuri Bluff to the mouth of the Clarence River should be tested. The distance was about forty miles, and such testing was likely to prove beneficial to those engaged in this industry at Kaikoura. He hoped the Hon. the Minister would, in reply, state that he was willing to make pro- vision to have this done. Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister of Marine) said that when the trawling operations were com- menced, the Inspector of Fisheries had recom- mended certain places on the coast which he considered should be tested first, as there was some evidence that the fishing-grounds in the neighbourhood were good ; and in accordance with his recommendation these parts of the coast-line had been tested, and, taken all round, the results had been fairly satisfactory. The Government had at that time no information as to the fishing-ground off Kaikoura, until the matter had been brought under his notice by the honourable member. If circumstances had admitted of extending the charter of the " Doto " a few months ago it would have been done, but he was advised that, with the bad weather coming on, and the master being un- fortunately taken ill, it would be inadvisable to extend the charter. In the event of any further operations the ground alluded to would be tested. Mr. MEREDITH asked if there was any likelihood of any further tests being made. Mr. HALL-JONES said he could not say till the estimates were brought down; it was a matter for Cabinet to decide. A large sum had been spent in this direction within the last two years. If it could be done by either of their own steamers he was prepared to have the ground tested. AUCKLAND PUBLIC OFFICES. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) asked the Minister for Public Works, If he will this ses- sion place a sum on the estimates for the erec- tion of suitable public service offices in Auck- 
<page:542>
mental offices in Auckland were scattered about the city; some were in very inconvenient places, and a great waste of time was caused thereby, and a great amount of inconvenience to the public. Among the offices to which he referred were the Public Trust, the Public Works, the Valuation Department, the Stamp Office, the Advances to Settlers, the Registrar of Electors, the Old-age Pensions, and the proposed Tourist and Trade Office. Some of these were paying rent to private individuals for very insufficient accommodation. It would be good business to erect a suitable building and concentrate all the public offices in one building contiguous to the Customhouse. The public would derive great advantage from such a course, and public and private business would be expedited. He would ask the Minis- ter, in the erection of any building, when : that the railway would be taken through making provision for the Tourist and Trade Office, to bear in mind the desirability of in- ! cluding a Hall of Commerce and Industries, in ! which the country's industries and products might be exhibited. Auckland was the entrepôt of the tourist traffic, and travellers from all parts of the world visiting the Rotorua wonder- land passed through Auckland, and it would be a very desirable thing to have such a hall in which travellers might see and form some idea of the products and resources of the colony. He knew that this matter had engaged the attention of the Minister for some time past ; and he hoped that any little difficulty in regard to the site might be overcome, and that, if  necessary, the site would be taken compulsorily under the Public Works Act. Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister for Public Works) said, No doubt considerable inconveni- ence arose from the position as stated by the honourable gentleman, and he hoped to remedy it by sooner or later making additions to the present Customhouse building. The matter had been delayed owing to the exorbitant price asked by the owner of the adjoining land ; but, owing to what he had seen during a recent visit to Auckland, he had given instructions for the land to be taken under the Public Works Act. Which departments were to be accommodated in that building had not been decided on, but he was of opinion that the Tourist Department should be located in a main central spot. Mr. NAPIER might mention that there was an excellent allotment adjoining the Auckland Railway-station, which the Minister could lease from the Harbour Board, on which he would be pleased to see a hall of commerce erected. RAILWAY TO HANMER PLAINS. Mr. MEREDITH asked the Government, Whether, in the event of the Government ac- quiring sixteen thousand acres of the Lyndon Estate, now under negotiation, and before the said block is subdivided for settlement, they will have a report made by a competent engi- neer on the practicability of extending the rail- way from Culverden to Hanmer Plains via the Lyndon Pass, and, if the report is favourable, make reservations for a railway-line? He was Mr. Napier acquired sixteen thousand acres. Such being the case, he thought the Minister should con- sider the advisability of continuing the railway. line as indicated in the question. From Cul- verden to Hanmer Plains was twenty - four miles, and, taking the annually increasing num- ber of tourists who went there into considera- tion, it showed the day was not far distant when the extension of the railway must come within the region of practical politics. In the meantime, what was asked for was to have a report by a competent engineer, so that when the land was being surveyed for subdivision a reserve for a railway might be made. The block he referred to as acquired contained six- teen thousand acres, and the Government had already acquired some six thousand acres, making a total of twenty-two thousand, so country occupied by Crown tenants. Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) agreed that, when land was acquired by the State, it was wise to reserve land for a railway through it, otherwise it might lead to large sums being claimed for compensation in years to come. He would like it to be distinctly understood that in reserving such land for a railway it was not to be taken as an indication that it was proposed to make a railway ; it was only in case it was proposed in future years, to enable that to be done at the least cost. SUBSIDY TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES. Mr. E. G. ALLEN (Waikouaiti) 5.0. asked the Government, Whether they will give a subsidy of £1 for £1, up to $50, on subscriptions taken up in country townships for the purpose of erecting buildings for public libraries ? Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) said this pointed to a very important question : as to whether they were going to subsidise library buildings, in addition to the subsidy for the purchase of books, and other expenses. He was afraid that he could not hold out much hope of this. However, he would promise that when the Government were bringing down the supplementary or Public Works estimates the whole matter would be carefully considered, and the honourable gentle- man would be able, when seeing these estimates, to form an idea as to the intention of the Government. But he did not give an all-round promise that such a proposal would be given effect to. NATIVE LAND ADMINISTRATION ACT. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) asked the Native Minister, When the Native Land Ad- ministration Act, passed last session, will come into force, and what is the reason of its being hung up so long? Last session the Native Land Administration Act was passed, and at that time great hopes were entertained of its being the means of solving all the difficulties in connection with Native lands; but those hopes, he regretted to say, had not up to the present time been realised. Since putting the 
<page:543>
intention to amend the Act, so that the ques- tion perhaps had lost some of its force ; but he trusted the Minister could tell them for what reason this Act had been hung up for so long, and for what reason the eulogistic remarks had been made in the Governor's Speech referring to the question. Those remarks were as fol- lows : - " I am pleased to inform you that the con- stitution of the Councils and Boards under the Maori Councils Act and the Maori Lands Ad- ministration Act has been proceeded with, and, with the exception of one part, the colony has been subdivided into districts. The outlook is very promising, and there is reasonable expecta- tion of waste lands owned by those of the Native race being thrown open ere long for settle- ment." He would ask the Minister whether the reason for the Act being hung up was because one part of the colony had not been cut up into districts, as mentioned in His Excellency's Speech, and why that part had not been cut up; and why, though one part had not been gazetted, the rest of the colony, when the dis- tricts had been gazetted and the elective mem- bers had been elected, was debarred from the benefits of the Act ? Mr. CARROLL (Native Minister) said the honourable gentleman evidently, from the nature of his remarks, was aware of the causes of delay. The time lost was not so great after all, considering that the Act was only passed last year, and there was a very large amount of  intricate and novel kind of work to get through in order to make the Act successfully operative. The colony had been divided into several dis- tricts, in most of which there had been no trouble in the way of electing representative Natives as members of the respective Councils as required by the Act. There was still much, however, for the Government to do in order to make those appointments and the constitution of the Councils complete. The Government had to elect their nominees before the Councils could be properly set up. This they were not able to do all at once, owing to the difficulty of getting specially suitable men. The honourable gentleman was aware that the success of the Act would depend largely on the persons ap- pointed to administer it. Their selection, therefore, required time and very careful con- sideration in order to secure the best results. The honourable member would see that that in itself offered a very fair reason for the delay. The chief delay, however, which pre- vented the earlier coming into operation of the Act was the fact that a dispute had arisen in regard to one of the districts proposed to be set apart. There were several tribal interests in- volved in the particular issue, and the represen- tatives of the various tribes interested claimed different district boundaries. One division of the people wanted all the lands in dispute in- cluded in one district, and the other held out for soparate districts. The matter was sub- mitted to the Government for settlement. The Government ordered a plebiscite to be taken, Government to the various Native villages and kaingas of the tribes interested in the proposed boundaries, to ascertain those who were in favour of one and those who were in favour of two districts. He was glad to announce that this had been done, and the result went to show that the proposition that there should be two districts instead of one had been carried. Now that that phase of the question was settled, the elections would be ordered to take place as early as possible. And, when the Natives had elected their members, he could assure the honourable gentleman that the Government would be ready to make their appointments, and if the House this session would pass the amending Bill he had given notice of, he could well hold out hopes of the Act coming into operation at an early period. He might say, in one or two words, that the purpose of the amending Act was to afford easier facilities for the better working of the Act. One or two pro- visions were inserted in the Act of last session which did not improve the prospects of its successful administration, as they would have wished, and it was necessary to have those provisions modified, and in some instances dispensed with. But the general principle of the Act would not be departed from in any way ; and he had every reason to believe that immediately the Act, with the proposed amend- ments, came into operation in the various dis- tricts of the colony, they might look forward to very important results. He knew that in some districts there were several large blocks of Native land, the owners of which were very anxious they should be dealt with under this Act. In one instance he could name, there was a block of 80,000 acres of very valuable land in the Wanganui district ; the Native owners were all prepared to have it dealt with, and, in fact, they asked him the same ques- tion as the honourable gentleman had put on the Order Paper-namely, "When is this Act coming into force? We want our property dealt with, cut up, and let to settlers, so that we might get some revenue therefrom." In other parts of the colony he had had the same question put to him, showing that there was a strong tendency on the part of the Native race to turn to the Government, and, with the aid of the legislation passed last year, adopt the policy of putting their lands on the market as soon as possible, in order that settlement might be brought about, and an improved condition of affairs assured to them. He felt certain that, when the Bill he had given notice of was being dealt with, he would have the co-operation of the honourable gentleman and of other mem- bers, with the view to perfecting what they had passed last year. Mr. HERRIES asked, if the Hon. the Minis- ter would inform him if there was any reason, where Native members were elected, why the Act should not be at once put into force, by the appointment of the Government nominees ? Mr. CARROLL said the Government in- tended to make the appointments as soon as possible. As he had said before, the difficulty 
<page:544>
their views, for carrying out this Act. The first thing they had to do was to utilise the best of their own officers. Mr. HERRIES said the Government had had a year to look for them. Mr. CARROLL said this was a very large and important question, and the Government did not want to miss fire at the start ; and in order to get the best men one might be par- doned for a little delay. They had some very good men connected with the Native Land Courts as Judges and officials, and it would be necessary to gradually bring about their tran- sition from the old regime into that of the new. He could say, generally, to the honourable gentleman, that whoever they appointed to these Councils, they had made up their minds to make the appointments as soon as possible, and they would be the very best men they could find inside their own official lines, and outside if necessary. MANAIA MAGISTRATE'S COURT. Mr. McGUIRE (Hawera) asked the Minister of Justice,-(1) Whether he will cause fort- nightly sittings of the Stipendiary Magistrate's Court to be held at Manaia : (2) if he is aware of the dilapidated state of the building that does duty for a Courthouse at Manaia, and will he have a sufficient sum placed on the estimates for the erection of a new Courthouse ; (3) if he cannot see his way at present to have a new Courthouse erected, will he have a suitable  room provided for witnesses, and the present He Courthouse renovated and furnished ? hoped the Hon. the Minister would give him a favourable answer to this question. The matter had been brought up by the Stipendary Magistrate himself, and he understood that, in the interests of the settlers, sittings of the Court In should be held at least every fortnight. reference to the dilapidated state of the build- ings, he hoped the Minister would place a sum on the estimates for a new Courthouse, or, if the Minister could not do this, he hoped the Courthouse would be renovated ; and that a room be provided for witnesses. It was un- pleasant for a Magistrate to have to turn wit- nesses out of Court, which they were compelled to do at times, in all weathers. He might also point out that the furniture was not in keeping with the dignity of a Court of Justice. Now that the subject-matter was brought under the notice of the Hon. the Minister of Justice he was satisfied it would have prompt attention. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Justice) said, In regard to the first point, inquiries would be made in order to see if the amount of business warranted an increase in the number of sittings. In regard to the second point, he was not aware that this condition of things existed, and he would have inquiries made at once and a report made upon the state of the Courthouse. In regard to the third point it would be necessary also to make some inquiry, and whether or not the suggestion could be carried out would de- pend on the result of such inquiry. Mr. Carroll Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) asked the Minister of Justice, Whether he has noticed the following statements contained in the annual report of the Commissioner of Police just presented to Parliament : That "the tele- phone is largely resorted to by the betting-men in carrying on their illegal calling"; that "many of the so-called private billiard-rooms are little else than gambling places" ; also, that "although ' The Municipal Corporations Act, 1900,' section 404, gives the local autho- rities power to pass by-laws for the regulation of these billiard-rooms, nothing has yet. so far as I am aware, been done in that direction ; consequently, these places are still under no restrictions whatever as to closing, &c., with the result that many young men, much to their detriment, are inveigled into these rooms, and kept there until the small hours of the morn- ing, associating with spielers and other unde- sirable habitués, who subsist on following race- meetings during the daytime and frequenting billiard-rooms at night "? This question, as it appeared on the Order Paper, was not in the form in which he drafted it. He thanked the editor of the Order Paper for his amend- ments, but they had taken the whole point out of the question. As it appeared on the Order Paper, the question put the Commissioner as saying that "the telephone is largely resorted to by the betting-men in carrying on their illegal calling." That signified nothing. This was the point : Mr. Commissioner Tunbridge, in his annual report, dated the 7th May, 1901. said, " I now find the telephone is largely re- sorted to by the betting-men in carrying on their illegal calling." I " now " find. That is the point. It was four years since Mr. Com- missioner Tunbridge was imported into New Zealand. He was imported at the time of the Queen's jubilee celebrations, in June, 1897. consequently it had taken him four years to discover that "the telephone was used by betting-men in carrying on their illegal call- ing." Now, long before Mr. Tunbridge was imported into this country he (Mr. Fisher) did all his betting on the telephone. He did his betting in an open and above-board way-if he chose to bet he betted, and if he did not, he did not. He did not care who it pleased or dis- pleased. For the last seven years he had sent his #1 along on the telephone to the special commission agent he was accustomed to send it to, just as he sent his El to Adams, "Tattersalls," at Hobart, whenever he felt that way inclined. Well, it had taken Mr. Tun- bridge four years to find out that the telephone was "now " used for betting purposes. Then the Commissioner went on to say that "many of the so - called private billiard-rooms are little else than gambling-places." How did the Commissioner know ? The Commissioner might have been so informed by the A.D.C. who followed him round in his evening street perambulations, because the A.D.C. had been known to make special inquiries upon this head ; but no such thing was known to any other person in this city. And the Commis 
<page:545>
cipal Corporations Act, 1900,' section 404, gives the local authorities power to pass by-laws for the regulation of these billiard-rooms, nothing has yet, so far as I am aware, been done." Now, he would give the Minister of Justice some particulars with which perhaps he had not been supplied by the Commissioner of Police. There were three private billiard- rooms in Wellington-one in Willis street, one in the high building opposite the Corporation Chambers, and one belonging to Mr. Patterson. It was really Mr. Patterson's room that Mr. Commissioner Tunbridge wanted to get at. Now, why did not Mr. Commissioner Tun- bridge institute his inquiries in a legitimate way? As a private speculation, Mr. Patterson had spent £800 in the purchase of land and the erection of a private billiard-room. There was no drink, no accessories of any kind attached to this private billiard-room. Mr. Patterson was enabled, by reason of his small expenses, to allow persons to play billiards at half the usual hotel or billiard-room price, and that returned Mr. Patterson a very fair interest on his outlay. He paid the Corporation altogether £24 a year as rates, and was a respectable citizen. Although Mr. Commissioner Tunbridge and his A.D.C., to whom he had made allusion the other day in speaking of the Police administration, said gambling was carried on in Mr. Patterson's pri- vate billiard-room, he (Mr. Fisher) and others were in a position to give that statement a distinct and deliberate denial. He went further than that : he would make this offer to the honourable gentleman and to Mr. Commissioner Tunbridge : So little was Mr. Patterson afraid of Mr. Com- missioner Tunbridge that he would hand over to him the key of his private billiard-room, and allow him to take sole charge, provided he did not make use of the key to shut up the room. Mr. Commissioner Tunbridge could then see whether any gambling took place. Then, following upon the report of the Commissioner of Police, the A.D.C. had taken to writing letters to the Evening Post, and if the Minister of Justice would read the Evening Post of the 6th August, on page 2, he would find a letter signed " Sufferer," written by the A.D.C., calling attention to this particular billiard- room, and the way the young pigeons were fleeced there. Mr. PIRANI rose to a point of order. Was the honourable member not prolix in his expla- nation of the question ? Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER said the question was a long one, and he did not wish to stop the honourable member, but he was watching what he was saying. Mr. FISHER said it was impossible to do justice to the subject in a few words. Mr. Patterson, as he had said, was willing to give up his key, aud all he asked was that Mr. Com- missioner Tunbridge should not close up the premises. There was no justification for the paragraph in the Commissioner's report. The municipal authorities were quite competent to attend to the affairs of the city, and the matter should be left to them and not to the police. I those who were known to be addicted to gam- VOL. CXVII .- 34. in future the Commissioner of Police confined himself to his legitimate duties. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Justice) said the explanation of the honourable gentleman's question had no connection with the question itself. The honourable member had simply taken another opportunity of reflecting on what he considered the improper statement of a public officer, and in doing so he had made some statements that were not in accordance with fact. The Commissioner of Police, in his report, said, -- "I now find the telephone is largely resorted to by the betting-men in carrying on their illegal calling; and many of the so-called pri- vate billiard-rooms are little else than gambling- places. Although ' The Municipal Corporations Act, 1900,' section 404, gives the local authori- ties power to pass by-laws for the regulation of these billiard-rooms, nothing has yet, so far as I am aware, been done in that direction ; conse- quently these places are still under no restric- tions whatever as to closing, &c., with the result that many young men, much to their detriment, are inveigled into these rooms, and kept there until the small hours of the morning, associating with spielers and other undesirable habitués, who subsist on following race-meetings during the daytime and frequenting billiard- rooms at night." That was the statement on which the honour- able gentleman had framed his question, and in explanation of the question the honourable member had referred to a Mr. Patterson. No Mr. Patterson was mentioned in the report, which report was general in its application. Then, with reference to billiard-rooms, the honourable gentleman asked how did Mr. Com- missioner Tunbridge know of the matter. Well, he (Mr. McGowan) knew of it. The parents of boys had come to him on this very subject. As was known, the local bodies had power to deal with the matter, but it was also known that the local bodies had not cared to exercise their powers. As to the proper hours of closing these billiard-rooms, he might say that, of his own knowledge, he knew they were the resort of people who were known to gamble. He was prepared to verify every word he was stating. Mr. Commissioner Tunbridge was entirely justified in referring to this matter as he did in his report ; and, for the benefit of the public, it would be well for Parliament itself to make some law in reference to these billiard-rooms, because, as he had said, the local bodies would not avail themselves of their powers. The local bodies, as members would understand, had a close connection with the owners of these billiard-tables, as ratepayers, and that was perhaps the reason why they were unwilling to make laws that might press hard on them. At any rate, the fact remained that they passed no by-law to regulate the keeping of these tables under proper control. As a consequence, young men were often found in these rooms at late hours, associating with 
<page:546>
for drawing attention to the matter, and was to be commended for referring to the subject in his report. TERRACE GAOL, WELLINGTON. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) asked the Minister of Justice, Whether the Government will this session place on the estimates a sum sufficient to provide increased accommodation at the Terrace Gaol, Wellington? Was the Minister aware that increased accommodation was required at the gaol in Wellington ? Re- ports had been made to the effect that the state of the Terrace Gaol was a disgrace to the city, that the association of the prisoners, three, four, and five in one cell, was detrimental to the discipline of the gaol, and that there were even worse reasons to be taken into considera- ion. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Justice) said it was his intention to allow the House to have the opportunity of saying whether improve- ments should be made at the Terrace Gaol, and & sum would be placed on tije estimates for the purpose. It was a fact, as the honourable gentleman stated, that the gaol was over- crowded. That was brought about by the failure to carry out the proposal to utilise the Mount Cook Gaol. At any rate, it was neces- sary that considerable alterations and improve- ments should be made in the Terrace Gaol, and the matter would come before the House later on, when the Public Works estimates were  brought down. CROWN LANDS FOR SETTLEMENT. Mr. McGUIRE (Hawera) asked the Minister of Lands,-(1) Whether he will, as expedi- tiously as possible, throw open the Crown lands for settlement in the Provincial Dis- tricts of Auckland, Taranaki, and Wellington ; and (2) will the Minister see that the roading of Crown lands open for selection keeps pace with settlement ? Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) might say that all the Crown lands in the Provincial Dis- tricts of Auckland, Taranaki, and Wellington that were at present ready for settlement were now open for application. To throw open all the Crown lands for indiscriminate settlement, whether they were surveyed, or explored, known or unknown, would not be conducive to profit- able occupation. As regarded the second part, it would no doubt be a most desirable thing if roads could be made before the lands were sold. The lands would be rendered more valuable thereby, and settlement would be greatly as- sisted. The matter had been, and still was, under consideration, but it was mainly a ques- tion of money, and if Parliament would vote the necessary funds it was possible to do what was required. In the meantime the construc- tion of roads to Crown and other lands had been placed under a separate department, with a view to the more vigorous prosecution of such works, and every effort would be made to execute such works promptly. Mr. McGowan Mr. HORNSBY (Wairarapa) asked the Minis- ter for Agriculture, If he will, seeing that as the present misleading cable-messages are pub- lished as to prices of frozen meat on the Home market, cause the Agent-General to be in- structed to cable to this colony the actual prices, and to distinguish in the cable-message between "North Island " mutton and " Wel- lington." Mr. DUNCAN (Minister for Agriculture) said the Agent-General had already been instructed to cable the Home prices of frozen meat each week. The cables had been coming to hand since the 10th June, and had been duly supplied to the Press. The question of quoting for " North Island " and " Wellington " mutton separately will be looked into. LAND FOR SETTLEMENTS BILL. A message was received from the 7.30. Legislative Council intimating that the Council did not insist on certain of its amend- ments in this Bill. # RABBIT NUISANCE BILL.

Mr. PALMER (Ohinemuri) .- I feel, Sir, that this Bill should go to the Public Accounts Com- mittee, and, therefore, I move the second read- ing pro forma in order to have it sent to that Committee. Mr. DEPUTY - SPEAKER .- I have been looking into this Bill, and unless the honour- able gentleman has a message from His Excellency the Governor stating that the Bill will be allowed to proceed, it will be my duty to rule that it is a Loan Bill, and is virtually a Bill giving power of taxation, which cannot be introduced without the recommendation of the Crown. Mr. PALMER. - I may say, Sir, that I applied to Sir Maurice O'Rorke for his ruling on the point. After I had been there for the first time, I was of opinion that Sir Maurice told me that the Bill could go on. It is for that reason that I want it referred to the Public Accounts Committee. If I cannot bring it on, the Government will, I understand, take it up. I was quite willing at that time not to go further with the Bill without a message from His Excellency the Governor, but Sir Maurice having told me that it could go on, I proceeded with it, and want it sent to the Public Accounts Committee. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .-- I am afraid I cannot take any cognisance of any private ruling the honourable gentleman may have re- ceived ; and I am not aware whether the honourable gentleman presented the whole Bill to Mr. Speaker. Mr. PALMER. -- Yes, I did. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- I must say that having given a ruling I must adhere to it. I went into the matter very carefully before I came to that conclusion. I would suggest, in 
<page:548>
opportunity to consider the matter, and allow time to obtain a Governor's message or the consent of the Crown, that the honourable gentleman ask to postpone it. Mr. PALMER .- I am quite willing, Sir, and will ask leave to postpone it until this day three weeks. Leave granted, and order postponed. # EIGHT HOURS BILL.

PRAYERS. # SAMSON AND SONS AND BLACKWOOD BROTHERS. The Hon. Mr. BOLT moved, That the report of the Public Petitions Committee on the peti- tion of Samson and Sons and Blackwood Brothers, of Dunedin, be referred back to the Committee for further consideration. His reason for moving this motion was that he did not think the Public Petitions Committee had given due consideration to the equities of this case. The circumstances connected with it were very simple. In the year 1894 an Act was passed which provided that local authori- ties could undertake the slaughtering of cattle and the establishment of abattoirs. These peti- tioners for some years before that, and up till, he thought, 1897 or 1898, were carrying on the business of slaughtering in Dunedin ; and the Corporation of the City of Dunedin were about the first to take advantage of the Act by enter- ing upon the business of slaughtering. The Corporation did so, he thought, in 1897, and the result of their entering upon this undertaking, so far as the petitioncrs were concerned, was that they had to give up their business. The Corporation of the City of Dunedin passed cer- tain by-laws connected with the carrying-on of the Corporation abattoirs, and these by-laws were of such a character that, although they were not prohibitive, yet they really bad the effect of so prohibiting competition with the Cor- poration that the petitioners could not carry on. In the year 1900 the power of the Corporation was still further increased by an Act passed that session, and by the 58th clause of that Act it was provided that any one who was injured or wronged through the operation of Corporation abattoirs should be compensated. It was unfortunate for these petitioners that they had been ousted from their position about a year or eighteen months before the Act of 1900 came into force. Had it not been for that circumstance they would have come in for compensation, as others had. Clearly, in all equity, they should get whatever com- pensation was allowed in similar cases, because it was manifest that if it was right to pass an Act in 1900 giving compensation to people of this class, it was equally right these petitioners who had suffered similar wrong should be similarly compensated. For these reasons, he begged to move that the petition be referred back to the Committee with a view to their giving further consideration to this view of the case. The Hon. Mr. A. LEE SMITH said his honourable friend opposite had set out the cir- 
<page:549>
not think it required very much more elucida- tion from him. Living as he did in the district, and knowing full well the circumstances of the case, he might be allowed to make a few remarks in the direction of what the honourable gentle- man had just said. His honourable friend had alluded to the Act of 1894. Well, that Act gave power to the local Corporations to build abattoirs, and Dunedin was the very first place in the colony to take advantage of that Act. The late Mr. Fish very persistently brought forward the question in Dunedin, and as a result of his efforts, after some degree of delay, the City Council took the matter in hand, and the taking of a ballot for the erection of the abattoirs was proceeded with. Well, follow- ing upon that Act, the Corporation of Dun- edin, as the honourable gentleman had said, in passing its by-laws practically put an end to the business of these petitioners. It was impos- sible for them to carry on at all, because the meat had all to be inspected by the Abattoirs Inspector, and there were, generally speaking, so many difficulties thrown in the way that it was perfectly impossible for them to do any busi- ness. Consequently, they had to close up their works, and kill at the Corporation abattoirs. The whole position, then, was this: There was no great movement at that time in the direction of making the killing of stock at the abattoirs compulsory, but it was seen by the experience of Dunedin-and the fact that no person would buy meat unless it was killed at the abattoirs-  it was seen by the people of the colony generally and by the Government that it would be a good thing to make the system compulsory, and therefore that eventually was done. His view of it-and he hoped honourable gentlemen would take the same view-was that, these people having been the pioneers in abattoirs, and the two petitioners being the chief sufferers, it was simply a matter of equity that those who had so suffered through the instalment of a sys- tem which was afterwards found to be a benefit to all should be placed in the same position as those who subsequently came under the opera- tion of the Act when the Government made the compulsory Act to apply all over the colony. Under the Act of 1900 the petitioners would have been entitled to compensation. Supposing a similar voluntary system were brought to bear on the butchers' shops, and some borough in the colony were to adopt that system and pass a by-law-empowered to do so by the Government, as in the case of the original Slaughtering Bill-a very stringent by-law that . the butchers should be under rigid inspection, and that all who did not conform to that should have their shops closed. He assumed that that case would be regarded by the Council as parallel to the present one. Then, if, Dunedin or any other borough having done this, it was found from experience to be an enormous safeguard and advantage to the people, and supposing the Government were to take up the question and make it compulsory all over the colony, applicable to all butchers' shops, and grant compensation to those who garded as entitled to be compensated just in the same way as those whose premises had been closed under the compulsory Act. That was the principle, and that might apply exactly to a great many other grievances when things were done for the general benefit, and hardship inflicted upon individuals. He considered that these people had a very great claim upon the colony. An Hon. MEMBER .- NO. The Hon. Mr. A. LEE SMITH said, in his opinion, they had such a claim. Dunedin had led the way, and then Nelson and Invercargill followed. He thought there were only two or three slaughtermen in Nelson, and two or three in Invercargill, and the whole amount of com- pensation that would be required for the three places would not, he thought, be more than about £1,500. He was very sorry the Com- mittee had not given this matter the considera- tion it deserved, and did not view it in an equitable light. The claim was one for which they could find any number of parallels, and was, he thought, one that should recommend itself to the Government and to the Council as very worthy of consideration. He would not say anything more, as the honourable gentle- man and he had explained the full circum- stances of the case. The Hon. Mr. SHRIMSKI said he had hap- pened to be a member of this Committee, and remarked that it seemed very strange to him that his colleague the Hon. Mr. Bolt should move in this direction. The matter had come before the Committee, and had been fairly con- sidered, as the report proved. The Secretary of the Stock Committee had been before the Com- mittee, and had given his evidence very fairly, carefully, and distinctly, favouring neither the Government on the one side nor the petitioners on the other. The petition had been reported upon to the effect that it was not within the province of the Council or of the Government to pay compensation to those whose business had been stopped prior to the coming into force of the Act providing for compensation. If there was any compensation to be paid in these cases it must be paid by the City Corporation of Dunedin, and not by the State. An Hon. MEMBER .- The other compensation is paid by the State. The Hon. Mr. SHRIMSKI said that was after the coming into force of the Act ; but these places had been closed before the Act had come into force. They had been forced to close their premises because of the act of the Muni- cipality of Dunedin, and the places had been closed for three or four years before the general Act came into force. Then, some years after their businesses had been closed these people brought forward claims for compensation. An Hon. MEMBER .- They had petitioned for two or three years. The Hon. Mr. SHRIMSKI said it did not matter if they had petitioned for fifty years ; they had petitioned in respect of what had happened before the Act came into force, and the only conclusion he could come to was that 
<page:550>
Moreover, it had been carried by the Committee that they had no recommendation to make, and that decision had been come to with the assist- ance of the Minister in charge of the business of the Council. If he was challenged in this matter he should speak very plainly. It was, in his opinion, wrong that a Petitions Committee should be formed consisting of too many mem- bers from one place, for then they had the power of carrying practically anything they liked. He acquitted of all blame the honour- able gentleman who was the leader of the Council, for he had not been responsible for this ; but he must say that the Petitions Com- mittee ought to consist of members from all parts of the colony, and that there should not be too many upon it from any one place. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER said the honourable gentleman who had last spoken had put him in rather a peculiar position by stating that he agreed with him for once. He accepted the compliment, and felt quite certain that this extraordinary coincidence of opinion proved the correctness of the views of both. He did not, however, object to this petition being again considered by the Committee if the Council thought that was desirable. He had voted on what he considered the merits of the case, and had not considered that these petitioners had any claim against the colony. The position, so far as he understood it, was something like this : The municipal authorities of Dunedin, for very good reasons, a year or two before the Legislature had moved in the matter, determined to establish municipal abattoirs ; and - not without meeting with a great deal of difficulty, probably owing to private interests interfering with the intention of the Corporation-they had got that Bill passed. The Corporation had succeeded in establishing abattoirs, which they believed to be for the good of the community. They had to stand the racket of any legal opposition ; and if it had been thought necessary that any individual should be compensated the Act would have stated it. When the Legislature was asked to pass a general Act the position was slightly different, as it was felt that in certain cases, such as Dunedin, there was no necessity to make any special privilege for any one, the common-sense of the Dunedin community having enabled them to establish abattoirs. But when the Act was passed relating generally to the subject it was felt that there were places in the colony where it was neces- sary to extinguish private rights in the manner indicated in the clause relating to compensation. But if compensation were neces- sary in this case the municipal authorities who reaped the benefit should pay it. They had taken the question into consideration, and weighed the pros and cons, and knew exactly what private interests ought to be compensated, and he gave them credit for sufficient generosity to think that they would have had a clause in- serted if they thought compensation necessary. He did not think there could be any claim on the colony in the matter, but at the same time Hon. Mr. Shrimski the Committee had come to a hasty conclusion, to the petition being referred back to them. The Hon. Mr. T. KELLY said, if he could see that any injustice had been done by any Committee to any petitioner on any occasion through not inquiring into the merits of a case he would be quite willing to refer the matter back to that Committee. But it appeared, from what he could gather, in this case the peti- tioners had carried on the business of a butchery in Dunedin, and through the regulations passed by the Corporation they had been compelled to close their business. The Committee said,- " With reference to the petition of Samson and Sons and Blackwood Brothers, of Dunedin, slaughtermen, praying that their case may be brought within the provisions of section 58 of 'The Slaughtering and Inspection Act, 1900,' your Committee have the honour to report that they have carefully considered the said petition, and have taken the evidence of the Chief Inspector of Stock thereon, and they have no recommendation to make." This seemed a very plain statement and, so far as he could see, it was unobjectionable. The grievance which was complained of arose some years before the Slaughtering Act of 1900 came into operation. In fact, under "The Abattoirs and Slaughterhouses Act, 1894," there appeared to be provision made for compensation, but of a very limited cha- racter. If honourable gentlemen referred to the Act they would see that it was only in certain cases that compensation was given. In clause 58 there was provision made for compensation when a slaughtering- place has been closed under the Act. The leases under which the person occupies premises may be determined, and half the value of the build- ings owned by him for carrying on his busi- ness shall be paid for, the value being de- termined by arbitration. It appeared to him the only way to do in this case was for the friends of the persons concerned to bring in a Bill, and let it come before both Houses. What was the good of referring the matter back to the Committee ? They could do nothing, as legislation in some form would be required in order that compensation could be obtained. The Hon. Mr. JENKINSON said he would be sorry to let it go forth that due consideration of this matter was not given by the Petitions Committee. The Committee had given full consideration to the matter, as it always did. and a certain amount of evidence was taken : but the facts were so simple that it did not take long to grasp the facts of the matter. The facts were very much as had been stated by the honourable gentleman-that these persons had no legal claim for compensation, but had in equity. They prayed that the Council would legislate in such a way as would bring their case under the same consideration as was shown by the 1900 Act. This meant that new legis- lation would have to be passed. For a Com- mittee to take up the matter and suggest new legislation would be a big thing for them to go 
<page:551>
sat down said, the question was one for a private member or the Government to take up. The most the Petitions Committee could do was perhaps to refer the question to the Govern- ment for consideration. They could not have gone further, as it was a question not only affecting Dunedin, but other parts of the colony ; and if the Committee brought in a report that the matter should be referred to the Government the effect, perhaps, would not be very different. He thought several other honourable gentlemen had said that in consequence of the 1894 Act being passed these petitioners had to close their business. He did not think that was the case. It was in consequence of the stringent by-law made in Dunedin that they closed up, and one question which the Committee con- sidered was who was to pay the compensation. The petitioners evidently thought the Govern- ment would take the matter up and pay the compensation. The feeling of the Committee was that it was a question for the local Munici- pality, because it was in consequence of the stringent by-law they made that these peti- tioners had to close their slaughterhouses up. But he was quite agreeable that more con- sideration should be given to the facts, and he would suggest to the honourable gentleman that he should amend his motion so that this petition might be referred to the Joint Stock Committee instead of to the Public Petitions Committee. He understood that a petition somewhat similar to this one had been pre- sented to the other Chamber and referred to the Joint Stock Committee. That Com- mittee had dealt with the principal Act of 1894, and the amending Act which fol- lowed, when those Bills were before the Legis- lature, and he thought, if it was necessary now to find out the true merits of the case, and see whether these petitioners were entitled to com- pensation, it was the Joint Stock Committee it should go to. Hence he suggested to the honourable gentleman the advisability of amending his motion so as to have the petition referred to this Committee. The Hon. Mr. SCOTLAND had always con- sidered that the referring-back of a petition to a Committee which had already dealt with it, for further consideration, was a very foolish thing, unless it could be shown that the Com- mittee had either not had time to consider the petition fully or else that there was not suffi- cient evidence available at the time, which might be forthcoming at some future time to guide it to a safe conclusion. What would be the result now if they referred back this petition ? Was the Committee to go over the same evi- dence again-to go over the old ground? Were the witnesses all to be recalled to repeat what they had said before? He really saw no sense in it at all. He would certainly vote against the motion. The Hon. Mr. PINKERTON hoped this motion would be carried, although he sympa- thized with what had fallen from the Hon. Mr. Jenkinson. The petition ought to go to the Joint Stock Committee perhaps. However, the merits of the petition had been gone into seemed to take the form that the grievance complained of was the result of competition. Now, it was not a question of competition at all. It was a question of Samson and Sons and Blackwood Brothers having been compelled to shut up by Act of Parliament. It did not say so in so many words, but that was what it was. The Government afterwards saw that injustice was being done to several other persons in being compelled to shut up by Act of Parliament- for the existing private slaughtering-yards in Dun- edin were successfully closed by Act of Parlia- ment. Since that the Government had recog- nised a duty to compensate persons who were compelled to close by Act of Parliament-and these petitioners were as effectively compelled to close by Act of Parliament as were the persons who were compelled to close up by the Act of last year. All that they asked for was to be placed in the same position as those were in who were compelled to close up by the Act of last year. As he said, the Government recognised their responsibility to certain persons who had been compelled to close up their establishments through the pass- ing of the Act of last year ; and these petitioners said that they stand in the same position as those persons who had been thus compelled to close up, although in the case of the petitioners they actually closed before the Act of last year was passed. Reference had been made to the evidence which was given by the head of the Stock Department. In answer to a question put by himself (Mr. Pinkerton) that officer said he recognised that the petitioners had no legal claim, but had a claim in equity. They all re- cognised that, because if they had had a legal claim they had no right to be there. But they had a claim in equity. That was all they wanted ; and he therefore thought that claim in equity ought to be satisfied. True, there was an idea it was by competition they were compelled to close up. It was not by competi- tion. It was simply because the Act of 1894 gave the Municipal Council of Dunedin the power to make certain regulations which they had not the power to make before that Act was passed. Therefore the petitioners had no power to place their meat on the Dunedin market, and as a consequence they felt com- pelled to close up. Let them take a suppo- sititious case to illustrate the force of this petition. Say two newspapers established themselves in Wellington, and that the Go- vernment said the people of Wellington should not read one of them, and should read the other. Would the persons owning the first newspaper not be entitled to some compensation against the Government ? He thought they would. The Government had a right to consider them. Now, the Act they passed last year said this, in effect : " We are going to close certain abattoirs, and we recognise in doing that we shall have to give compensation to the owners of those places that we close." Now, the slaughtering-yards of these petitioners were quite as effectually closed as those premises that were closed through the Act that was passed last year, and all they 
<page:552>
with on terms of equity. The head of the Stock Department had acknowledged they had no claim in law, but one in equity ; and therefore, as the head of the Stock Department had ad- mitted they had a claim in equity, that was all they asked for now-that they should be met in a spirit of equity. He considered this peti- tion should be again referred either to the Petitions Committee or to the Stock Com- mittee for fuller consideration. It was hastily dealt with, and on somewhat imperfect informa- tion. He would support the motion of the Hon. Mr. Bolt, and would also like to have the petition referred to the Stock Committee. He thought, however, it should go first to the Public Petitions Committee and then to the Stock Committee. The Hon. Mr. JONES said, if the persons prejudiced by the Act of 1900 were entitled to compensation so also were these people who were prejudiced by an Act previously passed that placed certain powers in the hands of the local bodies. But those who passed that Act which gave the local bodies such powers should have thought of it at the time the Act was passed, and should have made the necessary provision. However, it was never too late to mend, and if any injustice had been done it was their duty to rectify that in- justice. He did not, however, see what good was going to result from referring this report back to the Petitions Committee. What would the Petitions Committee do? As the Hon. Mr. Scotland had asked, were they to go through all the evidence again-the self-same evidence that was taken before ? If they were, then they would come to the same conclusion, presumably. An Hon. MEMBER .- NO. The Hon. Mr. JONES said, Well, if the personnel of the Committee was the same, and the same persons attended as had attended on the occasion that the decision was come to, that was likely to be the result. He therefore thought it would be far wiser to adopt the sug- gestion made by the Hon. Mr. Jenkinson, and that they should not send this report back to the Petitions Committee with the idea that that Committee should send it on to the Stock Com- mittee, but that they should send it direct to the Stock Committee, and let that Committee deal with the subject. The Stock Committee had more knowledge of the matter, he imagined, than the Petitions Committee, and they, having had all the legislation dealing with the sub- ject before them, would probably be able to deal with the petition in a more enlightened manner. He therefore moved, That the motion be amended so as to read, That the petition be referred to the Stock Committee for considera- tion and report. The Hon. Mr. BOLT said he had no objec- tion to the amendment which had been pro- posed, and probably the adoption of it would be the best course to take ; but he would like to make a few remarks upon what had been said in the Council. In the first place, it had been asked, Why should not the City of Dunedin pay the compensation ? To his mind, that was Hon. Mr. Pinkerton liament had already provided . by enactment that not the Municipalities but the State should pay compensation in these cases. The case under review by the Council was exactly on all-fours, with the exception of time, with the cases where the State was to pay the compensation as provided by the Act. The Parliament of 1894 passed an Act which em- powered the City of Dunedin to do what an Act of Parliament passed in 1900 recognised might result in injustice being done, and the Parlia- ment then, very properly, made provision for compensation being given in such cases. It was to give the petitioners the advantage of this later legislation that they were now contending. Surely there was nothing improper, nothing wrong, in that .. They recognised at once that the petitioners had no legal status in the Council ; but, as the Hon. Mr. Pinkerton had pointed out, if they had had a legal status they would not have required to petition-they would have gone to the Courts. It was only because it was a question of equity that they had brought it before the Council, and he thought that fact should be sufficient to empower the Petitions or the Stock Committee to give the question some further consideration. It had been asked. What could the Petitions Committee do ? Well, they could do something more in a question of equity than simply say they had no report to make. Surely they could say whether there was a question of equity at stake or not, but they had not even done that. They had passed no opinion whatever upon the merits of the case, and that was what he principally took excep- tion to. He thought that, whatever Commit- tee the matter was referred to, that Committee should express an opinion upon the merits of the petition. He accepted the amendment of the Hon. Mr. Jones. The Hon. Mr. A. LEE SMITH wished to say a few words. These people had been sacrificed in the public interest, first of all, by the Bill of 1894 ; and, as the Hon. Mr. Bolt had said, the Government after that had recognised that there might be throughout the country a great many people sacrificed, and therefore had made provision against it in the 1900 Act. And what was remarkable was that in one of the Dunedin cases the slaughterhouse had been burned down. and the insurance company, possibly taking ad- vantage of the fact that this slaughterhouse property was no good to the owner, did not pay the insurance, but reinstated the buildings after the Act had passed that rendered them useless. and the owner had been put to great expense to alter them so that they might be used as stables, which stables he did not require. They knew the man could get no compensation. and yet they had reinstated the buildings as a slaughterhouse, as they had previously been. That was certainly an additional hardship. With the leave of the Council the question was put as amended, " That the petitions of Samson and Sons and Blackwood Brothers, Dunedin, be referred to the Stock Committee for further consideration." Motion agreed to. 
<page:553>
The Hon. Mr. FELDWICK moved, That, with a view to the prevention of the dissemination of malarial fever and measles about the colony through the medium of returned South African troopers and their clothing, it is necessary that precautionary measures be taken. That a Select Committee, to be designated " the Public Health Committee," be appointed, with power to call for persons and papers, and to report within one month ; the Committee also to have power to sit and confer with any similar Committee ap- pointed by the House of Representatives. The Committee to consist of the following members : the Hon. Mr. W. C. Walker, C.M.G., the Hon. Mr. Williams, the Hon. Mr. T. Kelly, the Hon. Mr. Pinkerton, the Hon. Colonel Pitt, the Hon. Mr. Twomey, and the mover. He had had this motion on the Order Paper for some days, and in putting it there had had no desire to create any- thing in the nature of a scare. There was no need for that, but the hard fact remained that measles, at any rate, had visited this colony, undoubtedly through the medium of the returned troopers. In his opinion, the returned troopers should not have been allowed from under military control so quickly as they had been. He had every sympathy with the kindness on the part of the authorities that had permitted these men to rush to the bosoms of their families, to their mothers, wives, sisters, and sweethearts, as quickly as possible. But he thought that that kindness was the cause of the neglect of due precautions. Honourable gentlemen would notice that in the motion he had mentioned malarial fever as being probably introduced. For that he had indirect but very good au- thority. The opinion of a very prominent medical man was that enteric fever, as it was called-which was really typhoid combined with dysentery-lurked in these men, and would break out and spread among the population of New Zealand in a mild form of plague as soon as the summer came round ; and, at any rate, there was no doubt about measles being propagated in this way. He had the authority of a member of the House of Representatives for stating that the public State school at Stratford has been closed in consequence of an outbreak of measles. The attendance fell off from five hundred to 180. Many returned contingenters from South Africa were located there, and had been feted by the inhabitants on their return. As regarded the measles, to say the least of it, it was a very in- convenient thing to have it spreading through a family, and it was very undesirable that it should spread in a school. As to the amount of mischief it might do, honourable gentlemen would have seen a cablegram in the previous day's paper to the effect that there were 91,940 white and 24,547 coloured people in refugee camps in South Africa. During July the deaths among the whites numbered 1,412, and This most of these were due to measles. justified him in saying that due care ought to be taken. Whether he had been too strong in the motion-whether he had used \\ to prevent or allay measles, which was now the resolution so that a debate might take place on the subject. He did not know that there was so much danger from the men them- selves, but he did think the State might have seen that the men's clothing was taken and fumigated and washed, or-which would per- haps have been preferable-destroyed, and new clothing served out. He felt certain that what he had said, and what other members might say, would receive due consideration from the Minister of Public Health whether the resolu- tion was adopted or not. In regard to the name of the Hon. Mr. Williams, he had placed that on the Committee on account of his well- known interest in the Maori race. If an epi- demic of measles broke out among the Natives they knew its ravages were very serious, and they knew what it had done at one time in New Zealand, and at other times in Samoa and in Fiji. This he considered to be a matter of very great gravity. The Hon. Mr. PINKERTON seconded the He was convinced his honourable motion. friend wished to do no injustice to the returned troopers, but only to protect them from spread- ing illness amongst the people. It would be satisfactory to the wives, sisters, and sweet- hearts of troopers to know that they returned amongst them free from illness. This was the view the honourable gentleman took, and he hoped it would be the view held generally by the Council. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER hoped the honourable gentleman would be satisfied with having ventilated the question. It was true there was a serious amount of risk in the matters he had mentioned ; but, now that he had drawn attention to it, the Health Depart- ment would take the matter into consideration, and take every reasonable step that could be devised to minimise the evils of allowing per- sons to travel through the colony with unfumi- gated clothing or bedding. He would ask the honourable gentleman to be content with having moved the motion, and to withdraw it. The Hon. Mr. JONES hoped the honourable gentleman would not be satisfied with having ventilated the matter, because he thought more than ventilation was necessary. Under the circumstances, an expression of opinion from the Council was desirable. This was one of those things at which people were rather too much inclined to scoff ; but it was really a very serious thing indeed when measles made its appearance amongst children and assumed a malignant type. The Hon. the Minister had told them that, the matter having been venti- lated, the Health Department would take care to see that the evil did not spread. But why did not the Health Department take the matter up before? He had read somewhere-he thought it was in one of the papers-an ex- pression of opinion that the department had been exceedingly supine over the matter, and that they ought to have given directions as to what treatment should be adopted in order 
<page:554>
with having ventilated the subject ? It would do no harm, so far as he could see, to pass the motion, and it would emphasize the feeling of the Council that something ought to have been done by the department in the first instance. He thought it did these departments no harm to bring them up to the mark occasionally. The Hon. Mr. SCOTLAND could not agree with the Hon. Mr. Jones that it could do no harm to pass the motion. Only a few months ago they had been frightened almost out of their propriety by rumours of the plague, and a good many had, in plain English, lost their heads over it. A great deal was said about the unfortunate rats having introduced the disease in Australia, but he believed they had done nothing of the kind. However, thousands of rats were destroyed in New Zealand, but as to whether that kept the plague away from the colony he had his doubts. He maintained that if circumstances had unfortunately been favour- able to its coming to the colony it would have come to the colony. This motion was of such an alarmist character that he really thought tho Hon. Mr. Feldwick in bringing it forward should have given them some statistical data showing that it was necessary to set up a Com- mittee of this kind. He could see no necessity for anything of the sort, and he was certain it would not be a wise thing to do so. If this motion were passed by the Council they might depend upon it any amount of nervous people would be sure to take fright and to think we were on the eve of a visitation of mala-  rial fever, and enteric fever, too, perhaps. As for the measles causing havoc amongst the Maoris, he believed the Maoris were now just as strong as ourselves in body, and just as well able to withstand an epidemic attack as we were ourselves. They were not now like the North American Indians of old, living in a state of nature-poor creatures, who were cut off by tens of thousands when the small-pox got amongst them in the wild parts of the West. He did not think there was the slightest cause for appre- hension of anything of the kind here, and, even if he thought there was, he would consider it a very injudicious thing for the Council to pass a motion of this kind. In coming to the Council that afternoon he walked through about twenty of these young men, who had just returned from the seat of war, and finer speci- mens of health he never saw. He made the same remark when he saw a much larger party of them land in Wellington a few weeks ago. He would not be afraid of their in- troducing any diseases of the kind referred to. He believed if the germs of disease had got amongst them those germs would have perished on the voyage, and long before they reached New Zealand. He hoped the honourable gentleman would not press the motion, because he really thought if there was one thing they should deprecate more than another it was talking on this subject in such a way as to frighten outsiders, and lead to what might be called a scare in the country. Hon. Mr. Jones it was advisable not to appoint a special Com- mittee merely, but to set up a Royal Commis- sion to deal with this matter, seeing that they were so much in the habit of setting up Royal Commissions. He considered it would be a very proper thing to do. . The Hon. Mr. BOLT said it did seem a strange and unnecessary thing that, having last year established a Public Health Department, and set up a full staff of officials to carry it on, they should now be setting up a special Commit- tee to inquire into what, after all, was only a rumour. He really could not see that there was any necessity for this motion at all. If there was any necessity for it, or anything similar to it, he would be inclined to move an amendment - namely, That, after the word "clothing " the motion should read, " the Health Officer be requested to take the neces- sary precautionary measures." Surely it was not necessary to set up a special Committee of the Council, to be called a Public Health Com- mittee and to join with a similar Committee of the other House, to inquire into what, after all, might be groundless rumour. He begged to move the amendment. The Hon. the SPEAKER understood, as far as he could see, that the honourable gentleman who had moved the motion was about to rise to say that he was willing to withdraw it. The Hon. Mr. FELDWICK desired to with- draw his motion, but not without using his right of reply. The Hon. Mr. Scotland had just now made the assertion that the returned troopers did not bring to New Zealand any disease with them. Now, on the authority of one of these troopers, he could assure the honourable gentleman he was wrong in that assumption. When a former party of these men were in Wellington one of them told him- and he was quite certain from the man's style that he was speaking what he knew to be correct -- that the troopship " Britannic," which brought these men from South Africa, had just previously brought from England to the Cape drafts for the reinforcement of a particular regiment which was decimated with measles. It went with them to England. There were over seven hundred and fifty men aboard the boat. and a few days after leaving Capetown they had eighty-three cases of measles in the ship. Under these circumstances, it could be easily understood that the infection could be spread even by the clothing of the men who did not take the measles. Since they had come to this colony they had occupied berths in inter- colonial steamers ; they had been in railway trains, and their clothes had been in contact. he supposed, even with children, so that it was perfectly unnecessary for the honourable gentle- man to state the disease never showed itself on the voyage. This was simply preposterous. However, as he had said before, he had served his purpose-and, he believed, a good public purpose-and he desired now to withdraw his motion. He would have been quite willing to accept the Hon. Mr. Bolt's amendment but 
<page:555>
for them to formulate a motion to ask a sub- ordinate public officer to do something. He thought he had done a good thing in drawing attention to the matter by his motion. Having accomplished that end he now asked leave to withdraw it. Motion withdrawn. SHOPS AND OFFICES BILL. IN COMMITTEE. Clause 4 .- Special provision as to hours of employment.

A message was received from His Excellency the Governor, forwarding a draft of the Coal-  mines Bill, and recommending the House to make provision accordingly. On the question, That the House go into Committee to consider His Excellency's mes- sage, Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) said he wished the honourable gentleman at the head of the Government would give an assurance that on some specified day the notices of motion on the Order Paper would have some chance of being disposed of. Day after day the honour- able gentleman told the House that he had not had time to look through the Order Paper. That was the uniform answer the Speaker re- ceived when he called for unopposed notices of motion. The Standing Orders provided that unopposed notices of motion should be dealt with day by day ; and, although he did not wish to cast reflections on any members of the House, or on any body of members, he thought it to be regretted that there was not a strong Opposi- tion to see that the Standing Orders were given effect to as they should be given effect to. An Hon. MEMBER said there were no Standing Orders. Mr. FISHER said that was virtually the position - that the House had no Standing Orders ; but, being a Government supporter, it was hardly his function to call attention to the fact. However, if the Opposition members would not supply the fulcrum the members of the Government would have to do it them- selves.  ply with the Standing Orders, he would simply say that the Government objected to all the notices of motion. That would give the Govern-  ment time to consider them. Until he had re- plies from the departments he could not tell what motions would be opposed, but he did not want to block any of them in any way. Mr. FISHER said the financial debate would begin on the following day, and, that being so, what chance had members of getting their  motions before the House ? Mr. SEDDON did not think there were any on the Order Paper that were urgently wanted. Hon. MEMBERS. - Yes. Mr. SEDDON did not know what they were. At any rate, he would comply with the Standing Orders by saying that all the motions were opposed. Mr. BARCLAY (Dunedin City) was astonished to hear that the Government opposed all the motions on the Order Paper, because the first was in the name of the Hon. Mr. Duncan, and the second and the third in the name of the Right Hon. the Premier. It was certainly most  remarkable to hear that the Government were opposing the whole of the returns. Captain RUSSELL (Hawke's Bay) said the member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher ) blamed the Opposition because they were a fulcrum, and could not move the Government in the matter of allowing notices of motion to come on for discussion. He ventured to sav they had been a lever, but that the most solid fulcrum they could find was about fifty-five jellyfish who backed the Government. Mr. FISHER said he could give the honour- able gentleman an undertaking that they would mend their ways. Motion agreed to. Resolution agreed to, and Bill read a first time. THE LATE CONSTABLE L. McDONNELL. Mr. MEREDITH (Ashley) .- I beg to bring up the report of the Public Petitions Commit- tee on the petition of Elizabeth McDonnell, to the effect that, taking into consideration the very exceptional circumstances in connection with the death of the late Constable Luke Mc- Donnell, the Committee recommends the Go- vernment to grant the petitioner a compassion- ate allowance equal to three years' salary ; and I beg to move, That the report do lie on the table and be referred to the Government. Mr. FOWLDS (Auckland City) .- The report of this Committee deals with a very sad and peculiar case. The constable in question un- doubtedly contracted his illness whilst doing his duty at the wreck of the "Wairarapa." This caused prolonged suffering, and finally terminated in his death, and his widow is now left in rather unfortunate circumstances. I am aware that the Police Department have appointed her to the position of Matron in the police office in Auckland, which will help her somewhat. She has been left with five girls - mostly young. The constable himself was quite 
<page:557>
Government will give favourable consideration to the report of the Committee. Mr. MONK (Waitemata) .- I should like to add a few words to what has been said by the last speaker. Knowing the circumstances of the case, I regard this as an instance that should specially appeal to the Government. We all feel proud of brave actions performed by young New-Zealanders upon the battle-field ; but we are very apt to pass over instances of bravery and self-denial when performed at our own doors by unobtrusive public servants such as policemen. But I think the actions and conduct of the late Constable Luke McDonnell in the special instance of the wreck of the "Wairarapa," where a large number of bodies were strewn along the beach by that unhappy and calamitous accident, deserve special recognition. Those bodies were carefully gathered by him under circumstances that must have been specially revolting, which duty resulted in this officer's illness and death. I think it is only fair that some provision should be made for his widow and orphan children. This officer's illness was no doubt the result of the blood-poisoning he received in the per- formance of his duties. The handling of those bodies imposed on him years of wasting disease and suffering; but he died with a sense of having done his duty, commending his soul to God, and his wife and children to the care of the country. I think we should feel proud when we find that we have amongst our pub- lic servants men who are prepared to sacrifice themselves at the call of duty. Mr. LAWRY (Parnell) .- I heartily indorse every word which has been so well expressed by my honourable friend the member for Waite- mata. I would like to urge upon the Govern- ment the necessity of acting promptly in this case. I might state that I have received several letters in reference to this case from influential men in Auckland, and I trust that the Go- vernment will do prompt justice in this case. Mr. BOLLARD (Eden). - I merely rise to indorse what has been said by honourable mem- bers with regard to this constable's case. I knew Constable McDonnell well for many years. I have conversed with him many times on the question of how he contracted the disease which caused his death, and I am well acquainted with all the circumstances in connection with his case. I do appeal to the Government on this occasion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, to give a substantial compas- sionate allowance to his widow, as recom- mended by the Select Committee. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Justice) .- The Government recognises its responsibility in the case of any officer who loses his life in carry- ing out his duty. The presumed blood-poison- ing took place in 1894, and I am not going to discuss the question as to whether it arose owing to the constable's very praiseworthy action, nor am I going to discuss the question as to whether it was the cause of his death. The unfortunate man died, and his widow was left comparatively unprovided-for. The Government has already Donnell as a prison matron, and I think that the salary she receives for that particular office is doing her as good service as a sum of money would. In addition to this, she has also been allowed to retain the house. Every one is anx- ious to do what is right, and I would not like statements to go broadcast that the Government had not been doing their duty in the matter. All through his illness Constable McDonnell had received his salary up to the time of his death, and immediately an opportunity was afforded of giving the widow a position that would provide an income for her family, that was done. The salary was really better than a lump sum. I only mention this so that the House may know the actual facts of the case. It will therefore be seen that the Government had not been neglectful in the matter, as the widow was re- ceiving about #2 per week and a free house. Mr. MEREDITH (Ashley) .- It is not in- tended to cast any reflection whatever on the administration of the honourable gentleman the Minister of Justice. I believe he has done all he could under the circumstances. It is quite true he has provided the widow with a situation in the Police Depot, Auckland, at £2 a week ; but I would remind the honourable gentleman that she is rendering good service for the remuneration. When the Committee, of which I am Chairman, went into this question they had departmental and other evidence before them. I entirely concur in all that the five Auckland members who have just spoken said on the subject. The case is one of the most meritorious cases that ever came under the consideration of the Committee I have the honour to preside over. It was proved to the satisfaction of the Committee that Constable McDonnell in the discharge of his duty contracted the disease which cul- minated in his death, so that practically he sacrificed himself in the discharge of his duty. This being so, I sincerely hope the recom- mendation of the Committee will be given effect to, and substantial compensation be given to this lady for the loss she has sus- tained by the death of her husband, who was only forty-six years of age at the time of his death. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) .- As an Auckland member, I have had great pleasure in listening to the expressions of sympathy from the mem- bers who have just spoken. The case referred to is a very sad one. Constable Luke McDonnell was a first-class officer-probably one of the best officers in the whole Police Force of the colony. He was a man who put duty before everything else. Those who knew him best, and all the circumstances of his death, have not the slightest doubt that his death was occasioned by illness contracted while in the execution of his duty. McDonnell has done his duty to the country, and it is now for the Go- vernment to do theirs by making some pro- vision for the widow and family of the man who has passed away. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) .- I trust the Government will see their way to carry out the 
<page:558>
be no doubt the statements that have just been made are correct -- that is to say, that the death of Constable McDonnell was directly at- tributable to blood - poisoning contracted in the execution of his duty. I remember the cir- cumstances very well. At the time Constable McDonnell was one of the water-police. As Chairman of the Auckland Harbour Board, and in my professional avocations, I was often brought into contact with him. I knew him for nearly twenty years He was one of the smartest officers in the Force. He was always at his post, and, no matter at what hour of the day or night, he was ready to do his duty. If any special service was required at any of the outlying islands or districts, Luke McDonnell was ever ready. When the steamer " Waira- rapa " was wrecked it was found by Mr. Greenaway, who at the time of the wreck was temporarily residing on an island adjacent to the Barrier, that bodies of the drowned pas- sengers were being washed ashore. There was no medical man on the islands, and Luke McDonnell went down with one or two settlers, and I think he was left there alone with Mr. Greenaway for a time, and they buried a large number of bodies as they were washed ashore, and assisted in the work of identifica- tion. The bodies were in an advanced stage of decomposition, and he had no gloves or any- thing of the kind to put on his hands. He was sent away from Auckland without any of the necessary things to prevent blood-poison- ing, and the inevitable result followed. A pro- fessor, I think, of the Auckland University Col- lege, was the first to give him antiseptics, and with these he endeavoured to protect his hands. But the damage had already been done, and within a very short time he was laid up. He continued intermittently to do his duty, not- withstanding the fact that he was weak and ailing, and exhausted from many operations, until he finally had to succumb. If ever there was a case in which the Government ought to provide for the widow and family of a worthy servant of the State, this is one. The argument of the Hon. the Minister of Justice was most fallacious-that because Mrs. McDonnell had been appointed to a position in the Govern- ment service, in which, as pointed out by the honourable member for Ashley, she is giving an adequate return of service, the State is therefore to be exempted from doing its duty. I hope the Government will accept without any reservation the recommendation of the Committee, and as a mere act of justice grant the desired relief. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- I think the House will give to the Auckland members all praise for supporting this petition in the way they have done. There is generally unanimity amongst them on matters that affect that province. Hon. MEMBERS .- No, no. Mr. SEDDON .- At all events, the Minister of Justice has fairly explained the position to the House, and the House must take the responsi- bility. Mir. Napier with what has been done. Mr. SEDDON .- You are asking the Govern- ment to go beyond what your own laws permit them to do. Your laws will not permit more than two years' salary to be given as compassion- ate allowance, whilst this recommendation was for three years'. The Government have any amount of cases before them in which only two years' salary has been granted as compassionate allowance in the case of officers who have de- voted their life-service to the country. That is the position. Under the legislation affecting the Police Force, by a provision you made the session before last, you have not permitted any- thing like this being done. Consequently, you must consider that you are laying down a pre- cedent ; and, whilst the sympathies of the Go- vernment are as keen as those of any member of this House -- and we admit that the constable in question performed his work in a most satis- factory and almost heroic manner in endeavour- ing as far as he could to obtain identification for the bereaved relatives of those who suffered in the wreck of the " Wairarapa "-it must be remembered that there were others who had been refused in the past, and who had claims equally as strong as Constable McDonnell, and the Government would be bound, once the pre- cedent was laid down, to follow it. There was a constable in Dunedin who certainly risked his life and was wounded, and could never be again the man he was. I think he is dead now. Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- He is not dead ; but he cannot get anything to do. Mr. SEDDON. - Anyway, the rule was laid down and the Government had to adhere to it. In considering this matter we must bear in mind that we are laying down a precedent. 1 must say that, as stated by the Minister of Justice, to have given permanent employment -- with good behaviour it may be life employment -at a salary up to £100 a year and a free hous". the State, as far as this woman and family are concerned, has put them in a better position than if the husband was alive. Consequently it cannot be said that the State has not dealt with this case in a fair and liberal manner. 1 only rose to point out to the House that, while sympathy may carry us away, we must not for- get that what we do in one case we must do in any similar case that arises, and in a number of similar cases that have occurred in the past. Members may rest assured that the Govern- ment will do their best to do justice to all cases coming under their notice. Motion agreed to. PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE. 1 Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) brought up the report of the Public Accounts Committee on Paper No. 59, to the effect that in cases Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 5 the Committee saw no reason for proceeding further; and that in case 4 the action of the Controller and Auditer- General was unnecessary, as the moneys were 1 properly paid into the Treasury. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) .- Sir. with 3.30. regard to the first three clauses of this 
<page:559>
action is necessary, I wish to say a few words. The three clauses referred to deal with the services rendered by the "Tutanekai" in con- veving Volunteers and visitors to the Common- wealth celebrations on the other side, and to the payment for stores and supplies for the trip. The Auditor-General has objected to the payment in respect to these services being charged direct to the Marine vote, without there being a refund from some other depart- ment or from " Unauthorised." The matter came before the Committee; and the whole difficulty arises out of the amendment which was made last year in the Public Revenues Act. Honourable members will recollect what the result of the amendment of that Act has been in respect to other matters-how under that Act the Parliament was enabled to pay mem- bers $40 in addition to their proper statutory salary, a proceeding which would not have been possible but for the amendment of that Act. What has happened in respect to the £40 payment to members has happened in re- spect to the ordinary accounts of the colony. Payments have been made in connection with the ordinary accounts of the colony with respect to the Marine vote which could not have been made with the sanction of the Controller and Auditor-General, excepting for the alteration made in the Public Revenues Act by which the Governor in Council was allowed to come in and to interpret the law, or, rather, not to in- terpret the law, but to decide that certain votes  might be made notwithstanding Parliament had passed no direct vote on that account. These services include the sum of £600, in the first place, which was paid on account of the wages, and so on, and coal supplied for the "Tutanekai " to convey Volunteers and other visitors to Sydney; and they have been charged direct to the Marine vote. Mr. HALL-JONES .- Quite right, too. Mr. J. ALLEN .- "Quite right, too," says the Minister of Marine; and I am going to admit that it was right in the first place. But the Auditor-General sticks it up because there was no authority by Parliament for such ser- vice, and the Government refused to charge it to " Unauthorised." He has no objection to the Marine vote being charged with these accounts, as a service performed by the Marine Department for some other department which has to repay that service. That is where the difficulty has occurred. What has occurred before has been this: whenever the " Hine- moa " or the " Tutanekai" have rendered ser- vices for other departments, these services have been repaid by the department the service was rendered for, and the credit has been shown in the Marine Department vote. In this case that has not been done. The credit disappears from the accounts of the colony, and the Marine Department receives no credit for the work it has performed, while the Marine Department is to be charged with the supplies and provisions for the conveyance of these visitors to Sydney, $156 17s. in the first instance, and a further sum of $200, or something of that kind, in the Marine Department, and no other department is charged with them, and no credit is given to the Marine Department for having rendered this service to those departments. In this case the alteration in the Public Revenues Act of last session allows the Governor in Council to come in; and notwithstanding the objections of the Auditor-General that these sums should not be charged as desired against the Marine Department, they have been so charged. Now, Sir, excepting for the amendment of that Act, what has taken place under its authority would not have occurred, and the Marine Department would have received credit for these services rendered for some other department. Mr. SEDDON. - What department could you have charged them to ? Mr. J. ALLEN .- The honourable gentleman asks me what department. That is just the very point : there was no vote on the estimates for any department at all, and vet, in defiance of Parliament not having passed any vote for such services, the services were charged to the Marine Department. Now, there was a way of getting out of the difficulty, -but the honourable gentleman has not accepted the way suggested to him by the Auditor-General. There being no vote of Parliament for these services, and they being necessary, and in the opinion of the Treasurer or Minister should have been per- formed, there was a way of getting out of the difficulty. The honourable gentleman could have charged them to " Unauthorised expendi- ture," and to " Unauthorised expenditure" they ought to have been charged, and the Premier knows that perfectly well. What I object to in regard to this matter is this: that, now the accounts have been charged to the Marine Department, and not to some other depart- ment for whom the service was rendered, there has been a way provided for getting behind the votes of Parliament, and of charging accounts to other votes in regard to which Parliament has no knowledge ; and in this instance I do not know, and Parliament does not know, whether " champagne" is not included in the services rendered by the Marine Department-and I believe it is. With regard to the first three items that have been dealt with in this report, and which relate to services rendered by the "Tutanekai," in the way of provisions, wages, and coal, for the conveyance of Volunteers and other visitors to the Commonwealth celebrations at Sydney, the report says that no further action is necessary ; but in the fourth clause of the report we come to a different recommenda. tion. I think that clause says that the Con- troller and Auditor-General has done wrong- or something to that effect-in objecting to what has taken place. Clause 4 deals with the matter of the repurchase by the Bank of New Zealand of the preferred shares. The Bank of New Zealand paid, as directed by law, to the Public Trustee, half a million of money for the repurchase of preferred shares. But the law is absolutely clear on this other point : that any accrued interest that was due at the time the repurchase was made should be paid 
<page:560>
not a shadow of doubt about it to my mind. It was not so paid. I do not say but what afterwards the Public Trustee might have trans- ferred it back again to the Consolidated Fund, although there is a doubt about that. I believe the law wants amending both with respect to this initial payment of interest and with respect to future payments that the Public Trustee receives from the investment of this half-mil- lion. At any rate, the law is clear that this sum of interest of $5,657 ought to have been paid along with the capital sum to the Public Trustee; and the Controller and Auditor- General says so. There is a correspondence on the subject which is extremely interesting, be- cause it discloses the real way to interpret the law ; and I propose to submit to the House the new way in which the law is being interpreted by the Solicitor-General. The law was so clear that the Solicitor-General could not get rid of it, and there was no shadow of doubt that this accrued interest ought to have been paid into the hands of the Public Trustee. But the Solicitor-General had to advise the Government by some means or another that the law was not as it was; and how does he do that? If honourable members have the report in their hands-it is B .- 19, "Public Revenues Act, 1900,"- and refer to the Solicitor-General's letter on page 12, they will find these words, which are of interest :- "The Banking Act is, in the language of the Interpretation Act, to receive such fair, large, and 'liberal construction as will best insure the  attainment of the object of the Act according to its true intent, meaning, and spirit. Apply- ing this rule, section 8 is, I think, to be read as if the words "to the extent of the total capital sum represented by all the securities issued under section 7 hereof " were inserted between "such shares shall " and " be paid to the Public Trustee." We now have a method of interpreting the law by reading into the statutes words that are not there, and never were there; and that is how the Solicitor-General advises the Crown in respect to this payment of interest. Now, Sir, I maintain that the Solicitor-General has no right to read these words into the statute ; that the statute is plain and distinct, to be under- stood not only by any lawyer but by laymen ; and that there was no shadow of doubt that the interest ought to have been paid over to the Pub- lic Trustee. I believe myself that the Premier will yet have to come down with an amendment of the law to provide that the future interest may be paid back again from the Public Trustee into the Consolidated Fund. With respect to the last item I have nothing particular to say, except that the Controller and Auditor-General has been proved to be absolutely correct, because we ourselves this year have passed an amending statute to put this right. It is dealing with the question of providing money for roading lands for settlement. The Controller and Auditor- General objected on the ground that the law did not allow any expenditure to be made, and that he was right has been proved by our having Mr. J. Allen right. Sir, I know it is no use to. move that this report should be referred back again to the Public Accounts Committee, because, unfortu- nately, the Public Accounts Committee is of use only now for the purposes for which the Right Hon. the Premier and Colonial Treasurer de- sires it. It is of no use for searching into the accounts, for directly a member of the Public Accounts Committee puts a question which is dealing with a matter which the Colonial Trea- surer does not want to have any inquiry about the mode of procedure is this : The Chairman is called upon to rule whether the question is in order. And he invariably rules. so far as I know,-if it so suits the Premier, and if he sees the Premier wishes it,-that it is not in order; and consequently any attempt to inquire by the Public Accounts Committee into the public accounts of the colony is, to my mind, a complete farce. Mr. SEDDON (Colonial Treasurer) .- I do not wish to raise a debate and lose time-be- cause it is a loss of time-but I do not wish to allow the honourable member's re- marks to go on record without being met. No one regrets more than I do these continuous objections on the part of the Controller and Auditor-General; and when, as in these cases, the Law Advisers of the Crown advise that he is wrong in his interpretation of the law, what alternative is there but to carry on the public business of the country? If it was not so dead- locks would arise, and the administration of the country would be hampered and harassed. With regard to the functions of the Public Ac- counts Committee of late sessions, our functions have been confined simply to going into ques- tions as between the Treasury and Audit De- partment, and the Legislature has decided that all these papers must come before the House. The proper course is to place these papers before the Public Accounts Committee ; and really all we have to do during the last few sessions has been to inquire into these matters, and the legitimate work of the Public Accounts Com- mittee has had to be set aside. Now, that is the real position of the case, and no one knows it better than the honourable mem- ber for Bruce. Now, Sir, what is there in this case that has just been before the Committee? In all the cases except one the Committee did not think it worth while to call any evidence at all, and the motion was put without a division, and the honourable member for Bruce did not demur to that course. If honourable members will look at the minutes they will see that is so ; it was tacitly and gene- rally understood in the Committee in all the cases except the fourth that there was no neces- sity for the Committee to go into them at all. An Hon. MEMBER .- NO. Mr. SEDDON .- I say that was so. Mr. W. FRASER .- They went into them. Mr. SEDDON .- They went into them, but they did not call any evidence cacept in the one case. Now, I say that aspect of the case ought to be put. What does it matter as to the constitu- tion of the Committee if these are your results ? 
<page:561>
. It shows to the House that there was a general concensus of opinion on the Committee that these were matters of not sufficient import- ance, or that the decisions given had been in accordance with the law. Now, I come to the case of the steamers, and the charges to the Marine vote. I say there could be no other vote that the money could be charged to, and the House deliberately last session voted the money for the steamers. Let honour- able members look at the estimates, and they will see that we voted the money for the service of the steamers within and without the colony. If, therefore, the House voted moneys for the steamers for services without the colony, I say it was contemplated and un- derstood that if necessity arose to send these steamers beyond the colony the moneys for coaling and for food and equipment of these steamers were provided by Parliament. If Par- liament wishes to insist that they are not to leave the colony, or, if they leave the colony, that the moneys for coaling and equipment shall be charged against " Unauthorised," then let them simply confine the money for services within the colony. Why, then, was the altera- tion made for services without the colony ? The Controller and Auditor-General stuck up the money when the steamers went to Samoa at the time an emergency arose there, because the services had been rendered outside the colony, and on that occasion the expense was  charged to " Unauthorised." In another case, when the steamers went to the Cook Islands, the same course was followed. That being the position, I say the question now raised is not as to the charge, but the intention of the Committee was that there ought to be credit taken to refund the steamers for the services performed. That is what the contention was. Then, if that is the case, it is not a question for the Controller and Auditor-General, but a ques- tion of administration. In this case, where is the line to be drawn ? Portion of the coal and portion of the provisions on board would be used, of course, in the services performed out- side the colony. Then, what was contended by the honourable member for Bruce? The honourable member has kept it from the House, and it is a proposal that the honourable mem- ber for Hawke's Bay altogether objected to. The honourable member for Bruce said it ought to be charged against the Defence vote. did not tell the House that was his contention. The member for Hawke's Bay said, "Certainly not; why charge the expenses of men who are sent to take part in a function in Australia against the Volunteers and Defence Forces of the colony ?" Why, the honourable member's contention was simply the height of absurdity and nonsense. By what right should such a charge be made against the defences of the colony ? It forms no part of our defence. It was merely a friendly action. We sent some of our Volunteer Forces and a number of civilians to Australia, and why should the expense of so doing be charged against the Defence Force? That, however, is what the honourable member contended for on the Com- # VOL. CXVII .- 35 mittee ; and when he gets beaten he comes, like a naughty boy who does not like his beating, simpering to the House. The honourable mem- ber was wrong in this respect: he says the expense should be charged to some department. Well, have we a department for intercolonial visits ? I think I know the estimates as well as most people. We have a department for labour, and a department for industries and commerce, and other departments ; but I do not know that we have a department under the name of " Re- presentation of the colony in other colonies at State functions." The honourable member con- tended, however, that the expenses ought to be charged to a department. Mr. J. ALLEN .- Or to " Unauthorised." Mr. SEDDON .- The honourable member is now changing his ground, and says it should be charged to " Unauthorised." Well, the honour- able gentleman is altogether wrong in the position he has taken up. He also says there may have been champagne. I have heard of " Champagne Charlie," but not of " Champagne Charles "; and if it is at any time my good fortune to have the honourable member as- sociated with me in the representation of this colony at any State function I have no doubt he will get his champagne. I would not give him cold water. At any rate, the fact remains that the vote deals with the expenses of a steamer. The other costs, as far as the colony's representation at the Commonwealth celebra- tions are concerned, will come directly under the notice of the House. It is now only a question of whether, having your own steamer, you are to pay a large sum of money-probably double the sum-to private steamers to take your troops and your representative men to Australia. Certainly, the most economical way was to send our own steamer. Mr. W. FRASER. - There is no objection to that. Mr. SEDDON .- Then, why is the motion brought up? If it is on strictly technical grounds, then, I say, that on that technical ground the best judge is the Solicitor-(General ; and if you have any confidence in your Solicitor- General then why do members not take the thing on its merits ? As the honourable mem- ber said, " Has there been a single member of the Committee who has said the Solicitor- General was wrong in his legal definition ? " No, it was never contended for a moment, and He it is not contended now that his definition was wrong in law. Therefore, if he has been right within the law, and his definition is questioned by a layman-because the Auditor-General is a layman-there must be some one to put the matter right. If you do not have that, what is the result ? Your administration is stopped ; and there must be some mode of reference when difficulties arise. If you find fault with your present mode of reference then point out an improvement. If you have no means of settling these differences are you going to have the colony brought to default because there is a difference of opinion on a legal point raised by a layman as against the opinion of the Crown Law Officers ? Such a position would be monstrous, and why 
<page:562>
it should be everlastingly brought on the floor of the House I cannot understand. We come now to the fourth question, which has reference to the Bank of New Zealand. There was a sum of £5,000 odd of accrued interest on the prefer- ence shares of the Bank of New Zealand. As members are aware, the colony found the money for those preference shares. The Bank having now taken over the shares, the money, of course, belongs to the colony. The half million of principal was paid in to the Public Trustee. The question then came as to whether the €5,800 should be handed over to the Public Trustee, who would put it in the right-hand pocket, and then issue a cheque and hand it over to the left-hand pocket. That was the contention of the Controller and Auditor- General - namely, that it should be paid over to the Public Trustee. Another question was raised on the point as to whether the Public Trustee should hand it over to the Public Account. It was held by the Law Officers that the Government having issued the de- bentures, the interest on the dividends should go to the Government. If we did not get the dividends and the interest we could not pay the interest on the debentures. The colony would therefore have to find so-much money out of the Consolidated Fund without being repaid. The Auditor-General said that did not matter ; the money must go to the Public Trustee. Very well, the Public Trustee himself says : "Under my trust, and under the law of trust, I am only trustee for " - who ?- " for the Government." Mr. J. ALLEN .- No, for Parliament. Mr. PIRANI .- No, he said, " the Govern- #cc-zero ment." Mr. SEDDON .- As I said before, the member for Bruce has got a very bad memory. Mr. J. ALLEN .- I said he ought to have said " for Parliament." Mr. SEDDON .- You did not say that a minute ago; it was only when the master corrected you that you altered your statement. The money went into the Public Account, and we have paid the interest on the debentures. When the matter came before the Committee, the Controller and Auditor-General was called upon to give evidence, and he simply adhered to what appears in the papers before the House. There is also the opinion of the Solicitor- General. The Solicitor-General is more than ever convinced that he was right. It so happens that we have as Public Trustee a barrister and solicitor, and he stands high in his profession, and he is certainly unbiassed. Now, what does he say ? He says - Mr. J. ALLEN .- Might I ask what the Premier is reading from ? Mr. SEDDON .- I shall please myself what I read from. Mr. J. ALLEN .- I ask, if the honourable member reads from a document, that it be laid on the table. Mr. SEDDON .-- I can take my own notes surely. I say the Public Trustee made this state- ment to the Committee- Mr. Seddon Mr. J. ALLEN .- I ask whether the docu- ment should not be laid on the table ? Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- If it is evidence taken before the Committee. Mr. SEDDON .- Yes; I am not, however, bound to tell the House what I am reading from. An Hon. MEMBER .- Yes. Mr. SEDDON .- I say, I am not. At any rate, it is for the Speaker to call me in ques- tion, and I am prepared to defer to the de- cision of the Speaker. The witness was before the Committee, and the questions and answers were as follows :- " Right Hon. R. J. Sed.ion.] You are Public Trustee of this colony ? - Yes. " Some time ago you received $500,000 on account of the preference shares of the Bank of New Zealand ? - Yes. "Are you aware that there is some money coming on that account ?- There are dividends on the shares. " Did you receive that money-No. " Are you aware where the $5,657 10s. 6d. of dividends went ?- To the Government. " Had it come to you, what would you have done with it ?-- I would have handed it over to the Government. It belonged to the Govern- ment. "Captain Russell.] What does 'belong to the Government' mean ?- It belongs to the Government ; because if a sum of money is deposited, the person with whom it is deposited holds all future accumulations in trust for the depositor. "Right Hon. R. J. Seddon.] Presuming that this $5,657 10s. 6d. interest had been paid to you, what would you have done with it ?- I would have kept it until the Government de- manded it. All the accumulations on the $500,000 belong to the Government. I am only concerned with the $500,000. "Presuming the money had been handed to you, you would have paid it back to the Treasury ?-- I would have done so. It belongs to the Government, and I informed the Treasury to that effect in March last. "There is interest accumulating on that €500,000 ? - Yes. " What would you do with that interest ?-. Pay it to the Government. It belongs to the Government. If they wish to leave it with me I will take charge of it. "On what authority ?- The Act does not say what is to be done with the accumulations : but the ordinary rule of law is that the accumu- lations belong to the person who has deposited the money. Any work on Equity will show you that there are different sorts of trusts. If. for example, I convey a property to a trustee to meet a future claim, or to do something with that property in, say, twenty or thirty years' time, all the net accumulations on the property in the meantime come back to me. The law is so clear on that point that every lawyer knows it. "Could you quote any authorities on the subject : We want to know the legal position ? -I may refer you to . Lewin, Law of Trusts,' page 155, second edition, where it is laid down, 
<page:563>
to A and his heirs to pay testator's debts, and there is a surplus, this surplus results to testa- tor's heirs.' Again, in ' Story, Equity Juris- prudence,' second edition, pages 824, 825, the words are, ' Another form in which a resulting trust may appear is where certain trusts . are fully executed and yet leave an unexhausted residuum. In all such cases there will arise a resulting trust to the party creating the trust.' In the same book, at page 828, the following appears : 'The same principle applies to cases where the whole of the estate is conveyed or devised, but for particular objects and purposes, or on particular trusts. In all such cases, if those objects or purposes or trusts, by accident or otherwise, fail and do not take effect, or, if they are all accomplished and do not exhaust the whole property, then a resulting trust will arise for the benefit of the grantor or devisor or his heirs. In Cook v. Smith, 45 C. D., page 38, it is laid down : 'When a deed assigns the pro- perty of the debtor to trustees to pay debts, and does not expressly provide for the payment of the surplus to the debtor, there is a resulting . trust of such surplus to the debtor.' In fact, any work on Equity will give you any number of such cases. The principle is that, where there is a surplus beyond the amount required, that surplus reverts to the person who has paid in the money. " Have you read the papers in reference to this matter ?- Yes, I have read parliamentary paper B .- 19. " You will have noticed that in one opinion given by the Solicitor-General he reads in cer- tain words which are not in the Act. He reads them in so as to make clear the intention of the Legislature. Is there any authority for that ? -Yes, there is authority for it. I should not think it necessary to read in the words, the principle is so well known; but in ' Broom's Legal Maxims,' sixth edition, page 498, you will find this passage, 'He who too minutely regards the form of expression takes but a superficial and therefore probably an erroneous view of the meaning of an instrument.' In construing a deed, every part of it must be made if possible to take effect, and every word must be made to operate in some shape or other. 'The construction likewise must be such as will preserve rather than destroy.' (Lord Brougham, Langston r. Langston, 23 W. and Fin.) . The Judges ought to be curious and supple to invent reasons and means to make Acts effectual according to the just intent of the parties.' (Crossing r. Seudamore, Moseley r. Metieux, 10 M. and W., page 533.) ' They will not therefore cavil about the propriety of the words, when the intent of the parties appears, but will rather apply the words to fulfil the intent than destroy the intent by reason of the insufficiency of the words.' (1 Plow., 159, 160, 162) ' When a Court of law can clearly collect from the language within the four corners of a deed the real intention of the parties they are bound to give effect to it by supplying anything necessarily to be inferred from the terms used.' (Gwin c. North Canal in construing a statute that the intention of the law-giver and the meaning of the law are to be ascertained by viewing the whole and every If it can be prevented, part of the Act. no clause, sentence, or word shall be super- fluous, void, or insignificant, and it is a sound, general principle in the exposition of statutes that less regard is to be paid to the words used than to the policy which dictated the Act ; as if land be vested in the King and his heirs by Act of Parliament, saving the right of A, and A has at that time a lease of it for three years, in this case A shall hold it for his term of three years, and afterwards it shall go to the King.' ' It is by no means an inconvenient mode of construing statutes to presume that the Legis- lature was aware of the state of the law at the time they passed it.' (Jones v. Brown, 2 Exch., 332.) That is the general principle in the legislation with regard to trusts. " Then, the clause in the Bank of New Zea- land and Banking Act, which says that the $500,000 may be paid to you, being silent in respect to the disposition of the interest upon the debentures, you consider that it would have been superfluous to have inserted a provision in that regard, as the ordinary rule of law would apply ? - If I saw an apparent omission I would understand that the Legislature saw there was no necessity for the words. In some cases the Legislature has put in such a provision, as, for instance, in ' The Foreign Insurance Companies Act. 1894.' That Act allows the foreign companies to deposit securi- ties or cash with the Public Trustee. He holds them in trust to meet possible claims, and the Act expressly states that any earnings on the cash deposited go back to the depositor, but if the Act had not said so, I should certainly, on the general principle of law, have paid the earnings to the depositors." "All that you have to keep by law is the £500,000 ?- That is all. I should certainly pay the interest back to the Treasury. It would only be entered in the books of the Public Trust Office for the purpose of record, so as to keep the books clear. " Have you received any interest since then ? -Yes. " What interest ? - Interest on the sum for the half-year. It was on the 2nd July it was paid into the Treasury. " If there is any further interest accumula- ting what will you do with it ? - Pay it into the Treasury, unless the Treasury wishes me to take charge of the accumulations. " You do not expect any difficulty in regard to the interest accumulating ?- No. I expect the Treasury will ask for it and get it. " In the meantime the Treasury will have to find the interest ?- Yes ; 33 per cent. on the debentures. " Have you received any intimation from the Controller and Auditor-General not to pay this money to the Treasury ? - None officially. There is nothing on the file to show it. I have heard that he objects to its being paid, but his objec- tion has not come to me yet. 
<page:564>
"Supposing you received an official notice from the Controller and Auditor-General not to pay the money, would you still pay it over ?-- Yes. I cannot find any authority by which I should be justified in holding the money. It certainly belongs to the Treasury. " Would the Audit Office be able to prevent you paying it over ?- I do not know what would be the procedure. In March last I announced that I would pay the money over with the con- currence of the Audit Office. Of course, the Auditor-General may stick the matter up, but I do not see any objection to it. The money simply belongs to the Government. The Audi- tor-General is independent of me, and he may see objections from his point of view and refuse to pass it, but I do not see any objection. "He has to countersign the cheques ?- I cannot speak positively about that. The Ac- countant arranges that. If the Auditor objects there would be other proceedings. " Would not that be an interference with the administration of the Public Trust Office ?- No. The Auditor-General has control of our pay- ments, and can object to any of them. "Then, if such a contingency arose it would mean a Governor's warrant ? - Yes. If the Auditor-General objected, we could not pay the money without a Governor's warrant. " You are a barrister and solicitor ?- Yes. " And you are satisfied that what you are doing is well within the law ?- I have no doubt of it. I contend the law is so clear that no lawyer can have any doubt about it. All works on Trusts and Equity set the law out so clearly  32106019788246 that there can be no doubt about it. "Have you not a barrister in the office, and a solicitor outside, whom you could consult ?- Yes ; but I did not consult them in this case.     The principle is so clear that I took the respon- sibility on myself if any difficulty arose. If I had any doubt I should certainly have consulted the solicitor who conducts our cases outside ; but I had no doubt." The honourable member takes the narrow interpretation ; but I take the broader view, and I have given to the House what was really in- tended by the Legislature as the true interpre- tation of the law. Very well, what was this case ? Parliament said that the $2,000,000 should be paid to the Public Trustee, so that when the debentures matured, the principal would be there, and the Act said nothing further as to the interest upon these moneys -as regards the dividend on these preference shares the Act was silent, and why ? Because every member of Parliament knew that there was no use hampering the Act by putting these details into it, when the law already made all the provision that was necessary. If the shares are taken over by the bank, in that case the interest shall be paid to the Public Trustee, who shall pay it to the Government ; or, other- wise, that the interest accruing shall be paid, first to the Public Trustee, and then by the Public Trustee to the Government. I say, to have put all that into the Act was unnecessary, and not being in the Act they had to take the ordinary law of trusts. For the time being the Mr. Seddon Government are the beneficiaries and are en- titled to this money. If we do not get the money we should not be able to pay the interest on the debentures. Consequently, there was no necessity for it at all. At all events, that is the interpretation given by the Public Trustee, who is a disinterested party, and who says he would have done the same, whether the parties were the Government, the bank, or outsiders. Sir, that is the position, and upon it the attack is made upon the Government and upon the Legislature by the honourable member for Bruce. Sir, I can only say this, Why should we amend the law, when the law is at present perfect ? Is it because of the interpretation of the Controller and Auditor- General that an alteration should be made ? I say there is no necessity for it. We have done a good deal in the direction of altering our laws so as to avoid these petty troubles. Now, however, a position was being assumed that was becoming serious-so serious, indeed, that I think honourable members will see that there will be a necessity not only for main- taining our law as we passed it, but also for . a further extension of the law. As to the ques- tion of bringing the payment of the $40 to members into this question, I say that was al- together unwarranted. The honourable gentle- man, in my opinion, brought it in with the view of playing to the galleries. The law was not altered at all in respect to the €40. Hon. MEMBERS .- Yes, it was. Mr. SEDDON .- I say it was not, and I told the House that, in the face of the recommenda- tions that came before the Government, we were not prepared to go back from the posi- tion taken up, and where the law was altered we could not have paid in any classified department a shilling more for any service unless we had altered the law. We could not have paid the increase to the railway servants, and the recommendation came from the Railway Department. Of course it ap- plied in other cases as well; but it applied particularly to the railways, and it was to give effect to what was recommended by a Com- mittee of the House, which recommendation was carried unanimously by the House. To say that that was used for the purpose of giving a Government supporter a position is altogether false. Sir, I say it was a good thing for the country that that power was given. Mr. W. FRASER (Wakatipu) .- The honour- able member for Bruce said very truly that this report is the first-fruits of the Public Revenues Act of last year. The Premier has attempted to give a defence of the Public Revenues Act of last year. I do not think any member of this House looks with pride on the vote given for that Act, and if their inmost thoughts were known I think they would admit that they had done wrong. Mr. SEDDON .- You would not take the responsibility of repealing it. Mr. W. FRASER. - I would be only too happy to get the chance of doing so, and for the credit of Parliament I hope the Premier will bring down an amending Bill. Of course 
<page:565>
he will not. A good deal of the matter that ! pendent of any Government, and who can do has been introduced into this debate is a little foreign to the report of the Public Accounts Committee. In the first place, I want to say why I have risen. I have risen to enter my protest against this report. The report itself is a reflection on the action of the Auditor- General. The fifth case reads as follows: "That, in the opinion of this Committee the action of the Controller and Auditor-General was unnecessary, as the moneys were pro- perly paid into the Treasury." Mr. SEDDON .- You voted for it. Mr. W. FRASER .- The honourable gentle- man can surely carry his memory back to the last meeting of the Committee, when I raised my voice as loud as I could against this resolu- tion, uttering the word "No." I was the only one who raised his voice against it ; and that being so, I did not see the use of having my vote recorded, but I made up my mind that when the matter came before the House I would express my opinion about it. This House should be very careful how it passes votes of censure on the Auditor-General. It is to the Auditor-General that the House looks to be assured that the payments of the Govern- ment-not of this Government only, but of any Government who sits on those benches-are payments in accordance with the law. What is the use of having an Auditor-General at all, I would like to ask, unless you are going to leave him the powers the House has given him. Mr. SEDDON .- You had better put a lawyer there. Mr. W. FRASER .- The honourable gentle- man, for years past to my knowledge, winced under the restraint put upon him by the Auditor-General, and it was only last year, when the Public Revenues Act was passed, that he effectually clipped the wings of the Auditor- General ; and it is only since then that he can do whatever he likes. The House knows it, and it is right that the country should know it as well. The Bill we passed last year says this: "If a difference of opinion arises between the Treasurer and the Auditor-Gene- ral." Now, in the past the Auditor-General was supreme, and he could say "No," but he cannot say "No " now. All he can say is, " I disapprove of it." What does the Treasurer do ? He then gets the Solicitor-General to give him an opinion that the course he pro- · poses to take is a proper one, and he gets a warrant from the Governor, and the thing is done. Mr. SEDDON .- And why not ? Mr. W. FRASER. - " Why not ?" says the Pre- mier, and I suppose the House will agree with him when he says "Why not?" But I hope before long there will be a House of true repre- sentatives here who will say that the Govern- ment is bound by the decision of the Auditor- General. It is no use for the honourable gentleman to laugh and make interjections. I say the only safety the House and the country has-I am not saying it in respect to this Government, but of any Government -is to have an Auditor-General who will be inde- his duty fearlessly. He has done so fearlessly, and reported to the House what he thought was a breach of the law. The House referred the matter to the Public Accounts Committee, and the Public Accounts Committee now bring down a report that the whole thing was un- necessary-that is to say, that the Auditor- General was interfering improperly. I say he was not interfering improperly. Mr. MORRISON .- Which question are you referring to ? Mr. W. FRASER .- I am referring to the whole of them. I say he was justified in every report he has made to the House in regard to these payments, and that the money could not. have been paid but for the Public Revenues Act of last year, giving power to the Government to. defy the Auditor-General. The Premier told this House that the opinion of the Government, fortified by that of the Solicitor-General, should rule in all these matters. Well, what next. shall we learn ? Mr. SEDDON .- In the interpretation of the law for the last twenty years we have acted on the opinion of the Law Officers. Mr. W. FRASER .- I say it is a most extra- ordinary statement to make to the House. Surely the Auditor-General is the person whom the House should rely upon, and not the Soli- citor-General. What has the Solicitor-General got to do with it? If that is the case, of what use is the Auditor-General? Abolish the depart- ment of the Auditor-General, and leave the whole thing to the Solicitor-General. That is the logical deduction from the Premier's state- ment, and that is virtually what the Premier has got through the pliancy of the House last year when they voted for the Public Revenues Bill : and the country has got them to thank for it. Mr. SEDDON .- It has been the position for the last twenty years. Mr. W. FRASER .- Does the honourable gentleman mean to tell me that the Auditor- General is bound by the decision of the Solicitor- General ? Mr. SEDDON .- Yes, for the last twenty years. Mr. W. FRASER .- The honourable gentle- man knows perfectly well that he is stating what is not the case. To show, Sir, that the Auditor-General had reason for the objection he raised, when the Public Trustee was up for examination the question arose about the pay- ment of this particular interest that has accrued since. I asked him, "Have you paid that money ? " and he said, " Yes." I said, "Has the Auditor-General objected to it?" and he said, " Not officially, but I understand he has objected to it." The truth of the matter is that the money was paid by the Trust Office to the Treasury. Mr. SEDDON .- No, it was not. Mr. W. FRASER .- What is the use of the Premier saying that, because in the evidence ho read to us just now the Trustee told us so. He told us this : that as far as his office was concerned they paid the money, but the Trea- 
<page:566>
surer was not allowed to allocate it because the Auditor-General refused his sanction. An Hon. MEMBER .- You are mixing it up. Mr. W. FRASER .- I am not. I know what I am talking about. The Premier then asked the Public Trustee, " If this case comes up again, and the Auditor-General prevents you from paying the interest, what will happen then ? Will you not require a warrant from the (Governor in order to pay the money?" A warrant from the Governor seems to be the panacea for all illegal acts. I suggested to the Trustee, " Would it not be better to alter the law ? " Surely, if the law is wrong, or is doubtful in its meaning, then make it clear, but do not let us have this everlasting inter- ference of the Governor in Council in matters of this kind. I am sure a majority of members of this House agree with me that where a pay- ment cannot be made properly, or any doubt exists, the law should be altered, and that we should not rely everlastingly on that section of the Act of last year by which any illegality can be rectified by warrant from the Governor. The Premier endeavours to make this 4.30. point : Are we to depend entirely upon the decision of a layman, such as the Auditor- General is, on legal points ? I can quite under- stand that difficulties may arise on that point, and I know that the Auditor-General has, perhaps, a very high opinion of his own legal attainments. As a layman, I am not competent to express an opinion on the subject, but I do not see why there might not be an alteration in the law in that respect. I can quite conceive that difficulties may arise between the Govern- ment and the Auditor-General where it would be necessary that some independent person should step in and give an expression of opinion as to what the law really meant. It was sug- gested that the Solicitor-General should do this. Now, can any person conceive anything more ridiculous than that ? I am not talking about the present Solicitor-General-there is nothing personal in my remarks : but we know that the Solicitor-General is the servant of the Gio. vernment ; he is the Crown Law Adviser; and I say that the proper thing would be for us to adopt the same process as that which is adopted by other public bodies, such as the Waste Lands Boards, who, where the interpre- tation of the Act is doubtful, submit a case for the decision of a Judge of the Supreme Court. If some such process as that were adopted in the case under discussion, I conceive there would be no difficulty. A Judge of the Supreme Court is a person entirely independent of any one -- Parliament, the Government, or anybody else. An Hon. MEMBER .- Circumstances might arise when you could not get the opinion of a Judge in time. Mr. W. FRASER .- You can always get the opinion of a Judge within a reasonable time. Before I sit down I desire to enter my emphatic protest against the wording of the last clause of this report, because I say that it is nothing more or less than a reflection on the Auditor- General for having fearlessly done his duty ; Mr. W. Fraser and it will be a bad day for this House and the country if the Auditor General is to be deterred from reporting to this House what he conceives to be breaches of the law. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- The honourable gentleman emphatically contradicted me, and led the House to believe that I made a statement which was not founded on fact, when I said the Act had been passed years ago giving the power of appeal to the Governor in Council. Section 53 of the Public Revenues Act of 1891 says,- " If the Audit Office declines to pass any issue or credit requisition on the ground that the charges therein are not according to law, the matter in dispute shall be determined by the Governor in Council, having before him the opinion of the Attorney-General thereon ; but the objections of the Audit Office shall, together with the opinion of the Attorney- General, be forthwith laid before Parliament, if Parliament be then in session, and, if not, then within ten days after the commencement of the then next session." An Hon. MEMBER .- Is that the law now ? Mr. SEDDON .- It has been the law since 1891, and even prior to that date ; so that. although a good deal of capital has been made out of last year's amendment of the Public Revenues Act, you will find that it is in accordance with the law of 1891. I was contradicted when I said that the opinion of the Attorney-General had to be laid before Parliament with the objections of the Audit Office-and the Solicitor-General-who is a parliamentary officer, and under the Attorney- General, who, again, is generally a member of the Cabinet. With regard to the objection of the honourable gentleman as to the payment of the dividends of $5,600, I say that that money never was paid to the Public Trust Office at all, but was paid direct into the Treasury, and it is on the papers. Mr. W. FRASER .- I never mentioned one single syllable about the $5,600 -- Mr. SEDDON .- You said just now the money was paid into the Treasury. Mr. W. FRASER. - I never referred to that specific sum, but to subsequent payments, and I will give the honourable gentleman the Hansard notes of my speech to prove my statement ; and I say further, with regard to the power to appeal to the Governor in Council, the clause the Hon. the Premier bas just read is a different thing entirely from the clause in the Public Revenues Act of last session, and no one knows it better than the honourable gentleman. The wording 1 of that clause relates to an appeal on a question of law, but the wording of the clause of last session refers to a mere difference of opinion arising between the Treasury and the Auditor- General. They are two different things en- tirely. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) .- The honour- able member for Wakatipu has stated that the Act which this House passed last year provided that in every case of a difference of opinion be tween the Government and the Auditor-General 
<page:567>
That is not so. Mr. W. FRASER .- I did not say so. I said, "to decide as to the manner in which the receipts and expenditure were to be allocated." Mr. NAPIER .- That is not so. Section 9 of the Act of last year says,- "In case any difference of opinion arises between the Audit Office and the Treasury as to the vote, appropriation, fund, account, or other authority to which any expenditure ought to be charged, or as to the proper head of revenue, fund, or account to which any receipt should be credited, the question shall be determined by the Treasurer, and his determination shall be laid before Parlia- ment as provided by section fifty-three of the principal Act : " Provided that if in the opinion of the Audit Office the question involves matter of law, then it shall be determined by the Go- vernor, having before him the opinion of the Attorney-General thereon ; and in such case the objection of the Audit Office, the opinion of the Attorney-General, and the determination of the Governor shall be laid before Parliament as provided by section nifty-three of the principal Act." Therefore it will be seen that the honourable member is entirely wrong in suggesting that matters of fact were to be laid before the Go- vernor. It is only where the difference between the Auditor-General and the Government in- volves questions of law that the matter is re- ferred to the Governor, and in such cases the Governor is to have before him the opinion of the Attorney-General, or, if there . be no Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General. The honourable member for Wakatipu practically threw out a challenge to the majority in this House who passed the Public Revenues Act of last session, and he stated that there was not one honourable member who in his heart could look back with satisfaction upon the vote he gave last session in passing that Act- Mr. W. FRASER .- I did not say " one mem- ber "; I said " the great majority." Mr. NAPIER .- Well, Sir, I personally look back with the greatest satisfaction upon the vote I gave in passing that Act. I believe, Sir, that that Act has been greatly abused and extremely misrepresented in the country, and honourable members opposite think that by heaping abuse continually on that statute the \- public generally will forget what the statute really meant, and will consider that something extremely wrong, entirely unconstitutional, and improper was effected by that amendment of the law. Now, what has been the principal change in the law effected by the Public Revenues Acts Amendment Act of last session ? It is practically this: that the people of this colony, through their representatives, shall dis- burse the public revenues of the colony in the manner they think best without the interven- tion of any permanent officer or bureaucrat. Section 3 of the Amendment Act of 1900, which is the head and front of offending, according to with him, says,- "In any case where any payment of an item is provided for in the estimates as passed by the House of Representatives, and is included in the total of a vote in the Appropriation Act, such payment of the said item may be lawfully made, anything in any Act to the contrary not- withstanding, and the said payment shall be deemed to be irrespective of any appropriation or limit contained in any such last-mentioned Act : Provided that in no case shall the amount so paid exceed the total sum of the item voted : "Provided further that this section shall apply only to payments which could not law. fully be made if this section were not in opera- tion." I say, Sir, unhesitatingly, that the preten- sions of the Auditor-General are inconsistent with a free democracy. The representatives of the people are the sovereign power, and if the representatives of the people say that a certain sum of money shall be voted to a particular object, it is to me astounding to suggest that any salaried officer of the State shall interpose and say to Parliament, "You shall not vote this money. You, the custodians of the public purse-you, the power which levies the taxes- you, who voice the opinion of the electors of this colony, shall not decide how the public revenues are to be disbursed-how much is to be ex- pended in one direction and how much in another direction - unless you express your will with the formality of a statute." I say, Sir, that if a sum of money is voted upon the esti- mates, that is law; a vote of this House certainly is and ought to be law; and I am surprised that any honourable gentleman will contend to the contrary-will assert that a vote of the representatives of the people of this colony shall not be the law. Will the honour- able gentlemen opposite go out into the country and proclaim their belief that the representatives of the people ought not to rule this country ? I say, Sir, that the functions of the Audit Office are to see that the expenditure authorised is properly certified, that the expenditure has been made as it has been voted by the House of Representatives ; and it was never intended that this officer, however conscientious and however able he may be, should intervene and say that if there is a statute this House cannot by a vote modify or alter the payments men- tioned in that statute. Now, Sir, a great amount of misrepresentation as to the origin of this Amendment Act has been disseminated throughout the country. It has been said that this Act was passed because of a bribe of £40 that was offered to each member by the Govern- ment. There never was a grosser calumny or a fouler libel published upon this House than that statement. I am not in the confidence of the Government, and I found out perfectly independently -and any honourable member who wishes to investigate and inquire can find the same thing out for himself - that this Act was suggested and devised by departmental officers months before Parliament met. It had nothing whatever to do with the £40 sessional 
<page:568>
designed and it was suggested in order to over- come the difficulties that had arisen between the Audit Office and the Government with re- gard to moneys voted in cases where the ex- penditure had been fixed by statute. There were difficulties in connection with certain ex- penditure at Government House, for instance- necessary expenditure as it seemed to be to the Responsible Administration. There were diffi- culties in regard to increasing the pay of rail- way servants, because, their pay having been fixed by a Classification Act, it was contended that their wages could not be increased by vote of this House; and in many other ways the Audit Office raised objections which were not tenable, and which would practically whittle away the liberties of this House almost to vanishing-point so far as the administration of public moneys is concerned. I therefore say that the Act of last year was essential to restore to this House its proper power and the proper exercise of its functions. For over twenty years a (General Appropriation Act was held to cover the votes passed in the estimates. "The Public Revenues Acts Amendment Act, 1900," it seems to me, practically assures the supremacy of this House over the country's finance ; and in the final result do we not all agree that that must be so? What is to be law in this colony ? Is it not to be the voice of this House ? Personally, I have certain views in regard to another branch of the Legislature, but I do not wish to obtrude these views at this juncture, as they probably would not be relevant. But I do strongly contend that the  people of this colony are the sovereign power. They elect their representatives to this House to decide what moneys shall be collected from the people, and how those money shall be ex- pended. The representatives of the people, by the means known to the Constitution, vest their confidence in a certain number of members as the Executive for the time being, and if the Executive pay money improperly the proper constitutional remedy is to put them out of office. The provision in this law for the laying of differences between the Auditor-General and the Treasurer before Parliament is perfectly ample. Nothing can be done secretly, and the power of control by Parliament is absolutely assured. I therefore maintain that there is really nothing in the objection raised against this measure by honourable gentlemen on the other side, and that the constant attempt to belittle it and besmirch the character and re- putation of members who voted for it, and the suggestion that it originated in a bribe, and was passed at a price, is one of the most infamous calumnies ever disseminated in the country. Mr. SEDDON. - The honourable member for Palmerston challenged the statement I made that twenty years ago this was the law. I was speaking from memory, and I could not for the moment recall the Act. But I sent out to have my statement verified, and I find, on looking at "The Public Revenues Act, 1878," the following :- Mr. Napier issue or credit requisition on the ground that the charges therein are not according to law, the matter in dispute shall be determined by the (Governor in Council, having before him the opinion of the Attorney-General thereon ; but the objections of the Audit Office shall, together with the opinion of the Attorney-General, be laid before Parliament." Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston). - The Premier might have supplemented his statement by saying that the first part of section 9 of the Public Revenues Act of 1900 was law in 1872, and was repealed and not re-enacted until 1891. Now, you actually have the Premier trying to thrust a misleading statement down the throats of members of the House, and nobody knows better than he that, with the exception of the present Ministry, after the Grey Ministry re- pealed the first part of the section in 1878, such a clause was scouted by every Ministry this colony has seen. Mr. SEDDON .- It was the law in 1978, and even prior to that date. Mr. PIRANI .- No; in 1872; but it was re- pealed, and the Premier did not say so. Now, the most extraordinary thing in this debate has been the dissertation on constitutional govern- ment by the honourable member for Auckland City, Mr. Napier-the honourable member who after last session of Parliament, with this Public Revenues Act tingling in his ears, told the people of Auckland that constitutional govern- ment did not exist in this colony-that consti- tutional government was a myth. Mr. NAPIER .- I did not say that. Mr. PIRANI .- I have the honourable mem- ber's own speech here, and it has been read twice also in this House this session. It was published in the Auckland papers, and the honourable gentleman has not risen in his seat here or written to a single paper to contradict it. Mr. NAPIER .- I did not say it. There was no such statement in any newspaper. Mr. PIRANI .- I will read it,- "The first thing that struck him during his first few weeks in Parliament was that, according to the ideas he had formed of parliamentary government, and according to what was laid down by constitutional writers. parliamentary government did not exist in New Zealand. According to the Constitu- tion of New Zealand, the people of New Zealand were supposed to be supreme in the government of the country. The Ministry was supposed to be a committee of the repre- sentatives of the people, to obey the represen- tatives of the people and carry out their desires. The measures were concocted and devised by the Ministry, and members were supposed to accept them unintelligently. Constitutional govern- ment was a complete myth." Yet we have the honourable gentleman talk. ing the utter nonsense he supplied us with in his discussion. The honourable member knows as well as the rest of us what was the alteration in regard to the Order in Council made by the House last year, and he knows as well as I do, 
<page:569>
unconstitutional for the Auditor-General to pass a payment that is not clearly included in the Appropriation Act. The honourable gentle- man knows this too : these payments that are objected to are payments which were not even passed on the estimates. They are not em- bodied in our Acts as legal payments; and, therefore, if the House does not embody those extra payments in our Acts, as it ought to do, then it is the duty of the Auditor-General to refuse to pass them. Where is the Auditor- General to take his instructions from ? He is an officer of Parliament, and if Parliament do not give him instructions in the only consti- tutional way they can give those instructions, whom is he to take his instructions from ? The honourable member told us also-I do not know where he got his information-that the Auditor-General had refused to pass pay- ments to railway servants in excess of the wages laid down in the Classification Act. Where did the honourable member get that information ? Is it true? or did he invent that information, like a good many of the precedents quoted in the Supreme Court are invented at times? If the honourable member will look up the Appropriation Acts and the estimates for several years since the Classifica- tion Act was passed he will there find a sum voted to give 6d. a day extra to certain men in the railway service. There has never been any objection to that payment. It has been made year after year. Why? Because it has been included in the Appropriation Act, where it ought to be included, and where these sums which are objected to were not included. The honourable member knows as well as I do that the greatest safeguard a constitutional country can have of the proper expenditure of its public moneys is publicity. As far as I am concerned, I do not care a button if we had not the audit- ing of the Public Accounts of the colony at all, provided particulars of every single item of ex- penditure was laid on the table of the House at the commencement of Parliament ; but I will guarantee that the Government will not even appoint a Committee of its own supporters and lay before that Committee every item of expen- diture during the last financial year, or in any financial year during their term of office. That is the reason for this clause in the Public Re- venues Act-namely, to provide that where the Government propose an expenditure that the Auditor-General says is not in accordance with the law the items of that expenditure shall be laid before the House, and the House shall deal with it as they please. But, unfortunately, as the honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) pointed out to-day, the House is abrogating all its privileges. Standing Orders are nothing to us now, and under the rule of the Government any such thing as obeying the law of the land is utterly unconstitutional if it harasses the Government. I will give the honourable member an instance in which this practice of the Government has already worked evil in the colony. In 1897 there was a dis- pute between the Audit and the Mines Depart- Courts certifying to abstracts of receipts of Receivers of Land Revenue, and the Govern- ment, instead of compelling their officers to obey the law, actually amended the law, and repealed in the Mining Act the refer- ence to the Wardens, resting content with a statement by the Receiver of Mining Reve- nue alone. We know that the Receivers of Mining Revenue are, as a rule, in remote parts of the colony. Their accounts cannot be checked with the facility that the accounts of those in the centres of the colony can be. One officer in Otago, from the date of the passing of this Mining Act, embezzled receipts under it until the amount came to something like &700. Mr. SEDDON .- It so happened that in this case the accounts were certihed to by the Warden as being correct. Mr. PIRANI .- That is impossible, simply because under the law they are not required to be certified to by the Warden. If the honour- able member will read the Mining Act as amended by himself he will see that is so ; and I say this: It is far more in the interests of true democracy that the expenditure of the public moneys in this colony should be safe- guarded, even if the Administration is harassed, than that that sort of embezzlement should be encouraged. A very peculiar incident in this debate has been the forensic knowledge dis- played by the honourable member for Auck- land City (Mr. Napier). The more I hear the opinions of that honourable member the more I am astounded to think that a member of the legal profession can stand up and give utterance to them. There was another re- markable fact. Under the Standing Orders, Committees are supposed to bring down, in addition to the report, the minutes of the proceedings of the Committee and the evi- dence, if any. Neither the minutes of the pro- ceedings nor the evidence have been brought down. Now, the member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) is the Chairman of the Committee, and members will remember that the honour- able gentleman protested to-day against the Standing Orders being violated by the Govern- ment ; and yet he brings down a report, and violates the Standing Orders himself. I would say to the honourable gentleman that before he protests so much about the Government not obeying the Standing Orders he should obey them, and so prove to the Government by example that he is sincere himself. But although the honourable gentleman did not bring down the minutes and the evidence, the Premier actually has them in his pos- session. Now, I would like to know under what authority in the Standing Orders, or of Parliament, any member of the Committee -the Premier not excepted - excepting the Chairman or the Clerk, has the custody of the papers of the Committee. The Premier actually wanted to deceive the House by tell- ing us they were his private notes, taken by himself, I suppose, in shorthand. Why, there was nobody in the committee-room, except the shorthand writer employed by the Committee, 
<page:570>
and members will understand now why the Premier was anxious to exclude members from that Committee's meeting when they were de- liberating, because at the following meeting to that on which such action was taken, I am informed, the Committee passed a resolution ordering the Chairman to bring this report down to the House, and the Chairman, who now wants the Standing Orders obeyed, actually neglected to carry out that duty until two members of the Committee went to him and asked why the report had not been brought down. Then he comes here to-day with a bald report, without the evidence, and without the minutes of the proceedings, and expects the House to discuss it. Mr. FISHER .- Why bald ? Mr. PIRANI .- Because you are bald. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- The honourable member must withdraw that expression. Mr. PIRANI .- I will withdraw it, but I can- not deny that the honourable member is bald. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- I must ask the honourable member to withdraw the statement unreservedly. Mr. PIRANI .- I will withdraw the expres- sion. Will the honourable gentleman with- .draw his statement ? Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- I did not hear it. Mr. PIRANI .- No, of course not. Mr. DEPUTY - SPEAKER .- What remark was made by the honourable member for Wel- lington City (Mr. Fisher) ? Mr. FISHER .- He said I had brought down a bald report ; and I asked, "Why bald?" I will give my reply to that when I speak later on. Mr. PIRANI .- Now, there is a most extra- ordinary thing about the proceedings of that  #cc-zero Committee, and the reason, I suppose, why the minutes of evidence have not been brought down is that the Public Trustee, an officer of the colony, who is supposed to carry out the duties of his office independent of the Govern- ment, comes to the meeting with an armful of legal opinions in support of the Government's position - not in support, mind you, of the position between the Public Trustee and the Government, but in support of the opinion of the Solicitor-General under which the Order in Council has been made. It is a most extra- ordinary thing that a man in the position of the Public Trustee should show his hand so plainly in that direction, and that a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court-as the Premier tells us-should come to the Public Accounts Committee prepared to back the Government up at any price. The Premier read from the evidence of the Public Trus- teo his opinion as to resulting trusts. The Premier did not understand what he read a little bit, and anybody who knows anything about resulting trusts will see that the Premier got hold of the wrong end of the stick in this matter. We had the opinion of the Public Trustee as to reading words into an Act, but in the Public Trustee's evidence he said that you only read words into an Act when the meaning of that Act is not plain. I will Mr. Pirani are plain or not. This is the section of the Bank of New Zealand Act in which the Solici- tor-General so conveniently read the words :- "The bank may, from time to time, within six years after the issue of any such preferred shares, and on giving twelve months' notice of its intention so to do, repurchase from Her Majesty all or any of the shares so issued, at a price equal to the nominal amount thereof, plus the amount of all dividends accrued and unpaid in respect thereof up to the time of payment of the price ; and, upon payment of the price therefor, all such repurchased shares shall be surrendered to the bank, and be avail- able for reissue as hereinafter provided." Now, that is clear. The bank may purchase at the par price of the shares, plus the amount of dividend. And what is meant by plus? Is it minus? Then, subsection (2) says that all the moneys received for the repurchase of shares-that is, the par value of the shares plus the accrued dividends-shall be paid to the Public Trustee, and applied by him to the re- demption, when due, of the securities to be issued under section 7. Does that want any words read in it to explain its meaning ? The words are plain in the section. Then, the Public Trustee, in his evidence, said it was the Government who owned the money-that the money belonged to the Government. Why. there is no money that belongs to the Govern- ment. The idea of a lawyer using a loose expression of that kind! As a matter of fact, public money is not even under the control of the Government until we vote it on the Appropriation Act. Anybody who knows anything about the law of trusts knows this : that the moneys belong to the person who created the trust ; and Parliament created it, and it is to Parliament that any surplus over the £500,000 belongs, and if Parlia- ment likes to appropriate this money, that is a matter for Parliament itself. But it is as clear as can be that under the law the accrued divi- dends undoubtedly must be kept by the Public Trustee as a resulting trust for Parliament to \-- dispose of as it thinks fit ; and I challenge any lawyer of any standing in the colony to prove that that is not the law as to trusts and result- ing trusts. The Public Revenues Act has been. referred to very fully and very freely by the member for Auckland City (Mr. Napier). But I may tell the honourable member this : that one of the strongest supporters of the Govern- ment said this to me, with reference to the ±40 vote, when I was opposing the passage of the Bill, "That if that clause was not passed. the $40 could not be paid " ; probably a state- ment made to him by the Premier. An Hon. MEMBER. - I would like you to name him. Mr. PIRANI .- The member for Wallace, Mr. Gilfedder. I have no objection to name him. and I said to him, " If that is the case why does the Premier not get up in the House and say i so ? " Mr. SEDDON. -- It was not so. 
<page:571>
Mr. PIRANI .- The impression was created that the clause in the Public Revenues Bill al- lowed the $40 to be paid. I made this state- ment last year in the honourable member's pre- sence, and it is clear to anybody who under- stands the law that, no matter what was in the Premier's mind, that clause of the Public Re- venues Act is as I have stated. Mr. SEDDON .- The Railway Department recommended a change in the law two months before ever the question of a sessional allow- ance to members was thought of. Mr. PIRANI .- The Premier has complained very bitterly of the manner in which he has been harassed by the Auditor-General in regard to the finances of the colony. That is a matter between himself and the Auditor-General, and if the Auditor-General is wrong, then the Premier has been neglecting his duty in not coming down to the House and terminating the engagement of that officer. I say if there is an officer of the Government-I do not care who it is -- who is not carrying out his duties according to the law, but is unnecessarily harassing the Government-who is causing a great deal of trouble in regard to the administration of the colony-it is surely the duty of the Govern- ment to terminate the engagement of that officer, and put somebody in his place who will carry out the law as it ought to be carried out. But what are the facts? In every case where there has been a dispute between the Auditor- General and the Government on a question of law, the Controller and Auditor-General has been proved to be right and the Solicitor-General has been proved to be wrong. You have only to look back a few years, and you will see that has been the case. I challenge the Govern- ment to submit any cases in this paper to a Judge of the Supreme Court or to the Court of Appeal, and if the decision is against the law set up by the Auditor-General, then I shall be satisfied with the statement of the Premier that the Solicitor-General is right. Mr. FISHER .- Oh, you will be satisfied ; that settles it. Mr. PIRANI .- The honourable member for Wellington City will never be satisfied until he is Commissioner of Police. The Premier told us in these inquiries before the Public Accounts Committee that in all the cases except one no evidence had been called. What is the fact about the Public Accounts Committee? It is what I have termed over and over again the Government's public cemetery. They bury everything they think is nasty, or which tells against their administration, in the Public Accounts Committee. The Government have a large majority on that Committee, and the Government come down to this House com- pletely whitewashed. An Hon. MEMBER .- Only one member of the Committee disagreed with it. Mr. PIRANI .-- Take these cases. What are they ? They are disputes between the Treasury and the Auditor-General. The Treasury is the Premier under the Act ; you will see in the definition of Treasury it means the Colonial Treasurer. What happens? The Committee General and the Treasurer, and the Treasurer actually dictates to the Committee what evi- dence should be given, what questions should be asked, and how the inquiry is to be con- ducted. An instance occurred when the Secre- tary to the Treasury was under examination ; he was asked how he had invested this $500,000, and the Premier rose and objected to the ques- tion being put. The Chairman asked the Pre- mier to move in the matter, and the Premier moved a motion that the question should not be put : the motion was put to the Committee and carried. But at the next meeting of the Committee the Public Trustee was asked the question, after I had shown the Premier the investment in a public paper that had been laid on the table of the House, and the Premier did not object; and the Public Trustee said the money was invested in 3-per-cent. debentures. The Premier contradicted it, and tried to get him to admit that he had made a mistake, and that the debentures were 3} per cent., but the Public Trustee would not. Mr. SEDDON .- Yes, he did. Mr. PIRANI .- No; he said the Government were paying him 3} per cent., but the deben- tures were 3 per cent. I should like to know under what authority of Parliament the Go- vernment can issue debentures at 3 per cent. and pay the person who holds them interest at the rate of 3} per cent. ? It is a very dif- ficult thing to follow these £500,000 of deben- tures. The Premier told us, as honourable members will remember, at the time of the transaction that the £500,000 had been paid in cash to the Bank of New Zealand, because they had such a surplus of cash. No: Go- vernment had $500,000 of 3 per cent. deben- tures in pledge in London with the Bank of New Zealand, as collateral security, I sup- pose, for the advance of an equal amount, and the Government were paying the Bank of New Zealand in London 3 per cent. There is very clear evidence that the ques- tion of cash amounted to nothing at all, and there is no doubt these were the debentures the bank held ; they wanted to unload them, and they were unloaded on the Public Trustee for this £500,000. It would have been a simple matter in connection with almost every one of the disputes if the Government were to amend the law as they have done in one case-as they have done in regard to the Land for Settlements Act, notwithstanding the Committee's report. They did not wait for the report to be brought down, but they brought down a Bill under which they amended the Act in the exact direc- tion their Solicitor-General said it did not require to be amended. Surely if the Solicitor- General's law is so good-if he is such an authority on law-it is a most ridiculous thing for the Government of the day post-haste to bring down a Bill amending the Land for Settlements Act in the exact direction he said it did not require to be amended. And I say that should follow in regard to the other dis- putes. In regard to the money objected to in connection with the "Tutanekai," I say it is a 
<page:572>
highly improper thing that the "Tutanekai " should be utilised for the purpose of conveying a contingent to Australia without the authority of Parliament having been got for that ser- vice. It will probably be remembered that the honourable member for Riccarton drew atten- tion to the fact that, while the House last year adjourned on a Saturday, on the Monday fol- lowing the adjournment the Premier tele- graphed to the other colonies, stating that he was going to send a contingent over. He had no authority of Parliament for that ; and how he managed to evade the law was by charging the vote to " Marine : Miscellaneous Services." If the Premier had charged this to the "Un- authorised " Account it would have had to come before Parliament, and probably a dis- cussion would have arisen over it. This the Premier did not wish, and it was there. fore much easier for the Premier, if he could, to charge it under the heading of " Miscel- laneous "; it was easier for him to get the money, bury the vote, and the matter would not have come up again. That is another reason why I urge that it would be better than all systems of audit to have a system of giving publicity to every detail of the expenditure of the Government. But the Premier does not like publicity ; he seems to think there is some danger to himself -though I do not know why -- in giving the details of expenditure to the House, and therefore he gets into all this sort of trouble under the Public Revenues Act rather than lay the items on the table in "un- authorised expenditure." It is to be hoped that,  after a discussion and publicity of this sort, the Premier will see his way to effect his object, if he wishes to make such expenditure, by paying #cc-zero the amount out of " Unauthorised "-because he had a surplus of £43,000 of " Unauthorised " last year which he could have utilised-and allow the details to come before Parliament in the ordinary course, permitting the democracy- as the honourable member for Auckland City (Mr. Napier) says, constitutional government- to rule, and allow the representatives of the people to see how the services of the State are carried out. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) .- I wish to make a personal explanation. The honourable member for Palmerston, in exercising his won- derful facility for personal abuse, made this statement. He said that in the exercise of my profession I was accustomed to invent many precedents in the Supreme Court. The state- ment, of course, is absolutely baseless. I was never guilty of such a discreditable action, nor if I had been, or if any counsel were guilty of the dishonourable conduct of quoting a fic- titious case, the honourable member must know that the Judges of the land are sufficiently con- Versant with the case-law of the Empire to at once refuse to listen to a case where no authentic report was produced, and to visit with the severest censure any barrister guilty of such conduct. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- I also wish to put myself right. The honourable gentleman has repeated a statement which I know very well Mr. Pirani he will withdraw when I point out the facts to him. The section I referred to of the Act of 1878 was the law until repealed by the Act of 1891. Mr. PIRANI .- Oh, no; it was re-enacted in 1891. Mr. SEDDON .- If the honourable member will look at the repeal of the Acts of 1878 he will find in the schedule the Public Revenues Act of 1878. I have had the law searched from then to 1892, and I find that for years the same law existed as we passed in the Act of last session. That is the answer to the honour- able gentleman, and from 1892 up to the present day there was an interregnum of two years. Mr. PIRANI .-- You have found that out. Mr. SEDDON .- My statement stands good ; that that has been the law for over twenty years. What I rose particularly for was to refer to a pure fiction, a pure invention of the imagina- tion, to the effect that I had told the member for Wallace that the clause in the Public Revenues Act to which exception had been taken was inserted for the purpose of meeting the case of the increased vote to members. I say, Sir, that I never said anything of the kind to that honourable member. I repeat, that before the House met at all we were advised that an alteration of the law was necessary in the interests of administration, a proof of which I have now in my department. The statement which the honourable member has made was. I understand, made before, and, as the honourable member for Wallace is now present, I would ask him to either confirm or deny my statement. Mr. GILFEDDER (Wallace) .- Seeing that my name has been drawn into this debate, I would like, as a personal explanation, to say a few words. I desire to inform the House that the Premier did not speak to me in reference to the Public Revenues Bill, either before or at any time during its passage through the House. The member for Palmerston made the same allegation in Committee last session as I under- stand he made this afternoon during my ab- sence; and I then denied it. I can inform honourable members that the Government in- troduced that Bill without consulting me in any way in reference to it. Perhaps the honourable member for Palmerston thinks they should have done so. And I would further add that no member of the Ministry made any re- mark to me in reference to the Public Revenues Bill, or to any particular clause in it. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston) .- Sir, I desire to make a personal explanation, as the member for Auckland City (Mr. Napier) has misquoted me. What I did say was that he had quoted precedents in this case that had no existence- probably as he had done in the Supreme Court. As for the honourable member for Wallace, Mr. Gilfedder, I am sorry he has so short a memory. He told me last session that that clause of the Public Revenues Act was introduced to enable members to get an increase of salary ; and I replied to him at the time, "Why do you not ask the Premier to say so in the House ?" Mr. GILFEDDER .- Absolutely incorrect. 
<page:573>
Mr. SEDDON (Premier.)-I do not wish the Chairman of the Committee or any officer of the House to be placed in a false position owing to my having a paper in my possession that came from the Committee. The statement that was made in regard to it is incorrect. I am in posses- sion only of questions and answers that were put to the Public Trustee and that were sent to me in the usual way to see if the questions as reported were correct. These were sent to me in the ordinary course for correction, and that is why I was able this afternoon to give the whole of the questions and replies. Neither the Chairman of the Committee nor any officer is to blame in the matter. The ordinary course has been followed. Mr. HUTCHESON .- But you are not sup- posed to use them for that purpose. Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister for Public Works) .- When the honourable member for Palmerston heard the statement of the honour- able member for Wallace he should have got up and apologized. Mr. PIRANI .- Not when I know I am right. Mr. HALL-JONES .- A denial has been given, and a free apology is due to the honour- able gentleman. The member for Palmerston stated that the Act of 1878 had been repealed, and he led every member to believe that this had been done within the last year or two. Mr. PIRANI .- Oh, no; I said that it had been done by the next Administration. Mr. HALL-JONES .- No, not the next Ad- ministration, for that Act was passed by the Grey Government. Mr. PIRANI .- No; the Hall Government. Mr. HALL-JONES .- That is not so; the Hall Government followed. The law remained in force till 1891, and the same principle as regards any difference of opinion between the Auditor-General and the Government was con- tained in the law of last session ; the law of 1878 continued up to 1891. A similar provision was brought into operation in 1890, and we practically went on the lines of the legislation of 1878. Statements such as made by the honour- able member throw doubt on the accuracy of what was said in the course of his speech, and indicate the reliance that can be placed on what was said. The honourable member was unfair in his remarks with regard to the honour- able member for Auckland City (Mr. Napier). He quoted from that honourable member's speech, in which he said that constitutional government did not exist in Parliament ; but the honourable member for Auckland City gave a further explanation of what he meant at that time by pointing out that, under the con- ditions existing prior to the passing of the Act of last year, constitutional government did not exist, because the Auditor-General had been endeavouring to usurp the rights of Parliament and of the people. He no doubt meant that con- stitutional government did not exist until that Act was passed. Then the power of controlling the expenditure of money was placed in the hands of the proper persons- that is to say, the mem- bers of this House. Now, Sir, I rose chiefly to refer to what had been said in reference to the "Tutanekai." That was an instance to show that really there was an attempt to supersede constitutional government. I have here the appropriations for last year, which distinctly state that a certain sum was voted for the pur- pose of the Government steamers, and that the purpose for which the money was voted was for the "working-expenses within or outside of the colony." What does that mean ? It means that it is for any work that they may be engaged upon. I do not think any honourable member can say there is any difference be- tween the employment of the steamers in carrying Volunteers within the colony or to Sydney. Here, Sir, we have a distinct vote for a specific purpose authorised by Parliament. Notwithstanding this, the Auditor - General steps in and says, "No; you must charge this to ' Unauthorised."" The question was re- ferred to the Governor to be decided, and it was settled in accordance with the best legal advice that could be obtained. This House approved of the appointment of a Law Officer, who has to advise on this and other questions ; and what more could the honourable member for Palmerston consider necessary than the advice of such an officer? Then, with refer- ence to the interest on the Bank of New Zea- land loan, the honourable gentleman said that this officer had been influenced by the legal advisers of the Public Trustee. In dealing with any moneys that he may have in his charge the Public Trustee can get what legal advice he chooses, and he took legal advice as to what was to be done in this case. I believe there was no consultation between the Solicitor- General and the officers of the Public Trustee ; but, to show how correct the Solicitor-General was in his conclusion, the honourable member told the House that the Public Trustee went to the Committee armed with a whole sheaf of opinions, showing that he (the Public Trustee) had done right, and thus showing that the Solicitor-General had advised rightly also, and that the Auditor-General was wrong in the position he had taken up. The hour of half-past five having arrived, Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER left the chair. HOUSE RESUMED. On the House resuming at half-past seven, Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said, I do not intend to proceed with the orders of the day until we get these reports finished. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) .- Will you move a motion to that effect ? Mr. SEDDON .- No. I am not going to pro- ceed at once with the orders of the day. Mr. MASSEY .- Then, let me, Sir, call atten. tion to Standing Order No. 72 :- "When the House proceeds to the orders of the day on days on which orders have prece- dence, and after notices of motion have been disposed of on all other days, or on the House resuming at half after seven o'clock, as the case may be, Mr. Speaker is to direct the Clerk at the table to read the orders of the day with- out any question being put." I submit, from that, that you must call on the orders of the day in the usual manner. 1 
<page:574>
less the Premier is prepared to move that the Standing Orders be suspended, and that the orders of the day be postponed. Mr. SEDDON .- If that is your ruling I move, That Standing Order No. 437 be suspended. Captain RUSSELL (Hawke's Bay) .- Before you finally decide as to your ruling I would like to point out that the Standing Order says, " On the House resuming at half after seven o'clock, as the case may be, Mr. Speaker is to direct the Clerk at the table to read the orders of the day without any question being put"; From "is to direct ; " that is mandatory. that it seems to me to be perfectly clear that there is no alternative. Whether it is de- sirable or whether it may not be desirable, the Standing Order is perfectly clear that the Speaker is to order the Clerk to read the orders of the day without any question being put. And then the last part of Standing Order No. 53 says, " The debate on motions may be re- sumed after the orders of the day have been disposed of, on motion to that effect being put and carried." That evidently shows that you have to call on the orders of the day and proceed with them. Mr. SEDDON .- We have been in this posi- tion before. Captain RUSSELL. - No. Mr. SEDDON .- Yes ; the Speaker has ruled before that you can intercept the orders of the day by motion either to suspend the Standing Orders or to take other business. However, we can get over the difficulty, I think. Let us get  these reports done with. I simply ask that that particular Standing Order be postponed. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .-- My ruling is this: Standing Order No. 437 on this point reads as follows : - " Any Standing Order or Orders of the House may be suspended on motion made with or without notice : Provided that notice extending over two clear days, and specifying the hour at which such motion will be made, shall always be given when practicable ; and that a motion to suspend without notice shall not be enter- tained unless there be forty members present at the time such motion is made." The Premier having intimated to me that he intends to move the suspension of Standing Order No. 72, in order to allow the debate on the report of the Public Accounts Committee to be continued, it is my duty to count the House. There are forty-six members present ; the Premier, therefore, is in order in moving this motion. The House divided on the question, "That the Standing Orders be suspended, in order to allow the debate on the report of the Public Accounts Committee to be continued." AYES, 39. Fraser, A. L. D.

Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister for Public Works) .- I must express my regret that nearly a quarter of an hour has been wasted this even- ing by the Opposition trying to shirk debate on 1 this question ; at any rate, it indicates they recognise the weakness of their case. An Hon. MEMBER .- How much time are you going to waste now ? Mr. HALL-JONES .- I am not going to waste time, and we will soon see if the honourable gentlemen are really as anxious to go on with the business on the Order Paper as they pro- fess to be. Now, Sir, when the House ad- journed at half-past five I was referring to the action of the Auditor-General in taking up the extraordinary attitude he did in re- fusing to allow a vote authorised by this House to cover the cost of the Government steamers, both in the colony and outside the colony, to be expended, and how this was made the subject of a tag on the Public Accounts of the year. Honourable members will realise the absurdity of the position he took up on that occasion when I iu- 1 form them that for a very similar service the Auditor-General passed the account, and that too was for a service outside the colony. Then, why the distinction? It has been said. Sir, that the reason why objection was take ! was because the services of these boats for all work were paid for by the various departments. I know something about this matter, and 1 say it is not correct that all the work of these steamers is paid for. It is well known that there are many occasions upon which the work cannot be set down to any particular depart- ment, because it is colonial work, affecting all departments and affecting the colony, and in these cases the charges are not made. In fact. the system of charging to departments only came into regular operation within the last few years. There is no doubt that members who paid attention to our estimates last year will recognise it was a vote for the steamers' services in the colony's service, whether it was in the colony or out of the colony. Those 
<page:575>
who went to Sydney will also recognise that it was a colonial work. It did not refer to any one department. It was an advantage to the colony to have our men represented in New South Wales, and it was also an advantage to the colony to send them across in the Go- vernment steamer. Hence, I must express surprise that any sane man should have taken up the position that was taken up by the Auditor-General. There was no doubt in the mind of the department as to how the money should be charged ; there appears to have been no doubt in the minds of the Public Accounts Committee as to how the money should be charged ; there was no doubt in the mind of the Solicitor-General as to how the money should be charged : and, when the question comes on for decision in this House I think there will be no doubt in the minds of honourable members. The whole thing was done strictly in accord- ance with law, and with the wishes of honour- able members. The member for Palmerston made reference to the interest on the Bank of New Zealand shares, and to the action of the Public Trustee, and used terms that, I think, all members of the House will regret ; and, if the honourable member for Palmerston does not regret having used the words he did, all I can say is that he should do so. The Public Trustee is an officer who holds a peculiarly responsible position. He is the custodian of the affairs of hundreds of families, and yet the honourable gentleman said that officer came to the Committee determined to back up the Go-  32106019788246 vernment at any price. What did the honour- able gentleman bring forward in support of such a statement? The only remark he made to back up his statement was that he came to the Committee armed with a large number of legal opinions, which supported him in the course he had taken, and which said that this money should be paid into the public funds. If he wanted to prove the position he took up was legal, was sound, and on business lines, why should he not produce to the Public Accounts Committee the legal opinions upon which he had acted ? He had been challenged by no less a person than the Auditor-General, and there are the opinions of his legal adviser, which bear out the action of the Public Trustee with regard to the Bank of New Zealand shares ; and they supported the position taken np by the Ministry, by the Solicitor-General, and now by the Public Accounts Committee, and again I venture to say that that opinion will also be supported by members of the House. Sir, when we hear a member of the House occupying a responsible position - especially responsible when he makes reference to officers of the public service-making statements such as the member for Palmerston has made, I say it is painful, and every member of the House, in his own mind, must regret it extremely. That the Public Trustee took the course any man would have taken was borne out by those who supported him, or who gave evidence, or by the legal opinions. The Solicitor-General, the Public Trustee, the lawyers referred to, and the Public Accounts Committee all say in so Public Trustee was right, and that the course taken by the Auditor-General was wrong. The one was founded on law and common-sense, but for the other there was no reasonable explana- tion. Sir, while he has reflected on the attitude of the Public Trustee, he also made reflections upon the members of the Public Accounts Com. mittee, and I would ask on what grounds those reflections were made? It was said the ma- jority of the members of the Committee were Government supporters. Well, there are mem- bers of this House who are Government sup- porters, and upon that Committee, who would compare in honour and integrity with any men in the colony ; and does the honourable mem- ber think that men of that stamp on this Com- mittee would bring down a report that was not in accordance with their opinion? No, Sir; I am sure they would not do so. If the honour- able member thinks they would he holds a very low estimate of the character of members of this Chamber, and if he holds such an opinion it is an opinion that no one but the honourable member holds. Then, the honourable mem- ber says the Government altered the law, and that they did so in consequence of the Auditor-General having been found to be right and the Solicitor-General to be wrong. Sir, it was a similar statement that he made with reference to the Act of 1878, when he endea- voured to lead this House to believe that the law had been repealed within a short time of its enactment, and when we afterwards heard that that had been the law for twenty years. And so with respect to the alteration of the law ; there is nothing in the honourable gentleman's statement. If it showed anything, it showed there was an earnest desire on the part of tho administrators of the affairs of this colony to remove any doubt there might be with the Auditor-General in reference to the Public Accounts. There have been thirteen tags ap- pended by that officer to the Public Accounts. The honourable member knows all the circum- stances in connection with these tags as well as the Auditor-General himself, and he knows in his own mind how harassing they must be ; but he holds a brief for the Auditor-General, and he feels it to be his duty in this House on every occasion to rise not only in his de- fence, but to place the Auditor- General's views and position before Parliament. The honour- able member for Wakatipu said that in the old days the Auditor-General was su- preme. If he had only consulted the Acts of 1878 and 1892 he would not have made that statement as to the Auditor-General being supreme. There has for nearly thirty years been provision in the law to meet any doubt that might exist between the Government of the day and the Auditor General. It has always been provided that some authority should de- cide as between the two parties, so that the machinery of the State might move along with- out being clogged or hampered. I agree with the member for Auckland City (Mr. Napier) in his statement that Parliament should be supreme. And, if these attempts to interfere 
<page:576>
with the supremacy of Parliament should suc- ceed, I am sure the honourable member for Palmerston would be one of the first to regret it. I hope we will not have many more cases before us such as we have had to-day, and I trust the debate will have shown honourable members the origin of some of the tags which have been attached to the Public Accounts, and that they, like the honourable member's statements, have actually nothing in them. Mr. PIRANI ( Palmerston) .- I desire to make a personal explanation. The Minister for Public Works has repeated a statement made by the Premier, that section 9 of last year's Act is identical with section 50 of the Act of 1878. I stated at the same time that section 9 of the Act of last year used to be the law, but was repealed, and was not re-enacted till last year. Section 7 of the Public Revenues Act of 1872 provides :- " In case any difference of opinion shall arise between the Commissioners and the Treasury as to the vote or other authority to which any expenditure ought to be charged, the question shall be determined by the Colonial Treasurer ; but the objections made by the Commissioners shall be by them laid before Parliament within ten days thereafter, if Parliament be then in session, and, if not, within ten days after the next meeting of Parliament." That part of section 7 was repealed, as I stated, in 1878. Mr. SEDDON .- The part as to charging to  votes, et cetera. Mr. PIRANI .- Yes, that part. The clause then went on - "Provided that if, in the opinion of the Commissioners, the proposed mode of charge    is illegal, the opinion of the Attorney-General shall be taken, and the matter shall then be decided by the Governor in Council." The last part of that section was re-enacted in 1878 without the first part. In 1891-not 1892, as the Minister for Public Works said just now-it was re-enacted ; but last year the whole section-as well as the latter part-was re-enacted in "The Public Revenues Act, 1900." Mr. HALL-JONES .- What I said was that there was provision made in the Act of 1878 for any question in doubt or difference of opinion between the Auditor-General and the Govern- ment to be referred. Mr. PIRANI .- Only a question of law. Mr. HALL-JONES .- In these matters nearly every question that arises is a question of law, and that is where the Solicitor-General is more competent to express an opinion than the Auditor-General. Mr. SEDDON .- The honourable member re- ferred to me, and he must admit he was in error because he was under the impression that in re- spect to questions of law as between the Auditor- General and the Government that has been re- pealed. I say the law has obtained from 1878 and prior to 1878, and has continued from that time until to-day. There has been an addition in regard to the other point, at to what vote the money should be charged to : that was the ex- Mr. Hall-Jones tension made last session. The Legislature has recognised that there must be some one, if any dispute arises, to come and adjust it. Whether the right person has been fixed by law or not is for the House to say ; but this power must exist, and has existed for over twenty years. Mr. MONK (Waitemata) .- I should like to add a word or two about statements that have been made with regard to the $40 bonus. Some remarks have been made in its justifica- tion with which I cannot agree. The Minister for Public Works, in support of the statements made by the member for Auckland City (Mr. Napier), maintained that Parliament is su- preme, and can constitutionally do what it likes. Now, I claim our trouble is that we have no Constitution in this country ; that is our defect. The only Constitution we have is public opinion, or the will of the majority, and that was violated by the members of Parlia- ment last session ; for public opinion through- out the colony was strongly against the action by which they enabled the Premier to give members this $40. I can assure the Premier that one of his very strong supporters-he may  have seen it in the newspaper himself-described it as "a thievish action." I know that was in- correct. I know the $40 was paid legally, and I believe, too, what the Premier stated this afternoon - namely, that it was arranged months before Parliament met- Mr. SEDDON .- I said nothing of the kind. Mr. MONK .- Well, somebody stated it during this debate, that it was arranged long before Parliament met last session that the power which the Premier took under the Public Revenues Act should be obtained from Parliament, because the Auditor had refused some of his applications for money- Mr. SEDDON .- In respect to the railway. In regard to the sessional expenses of mem- bers, that part had nothing to do with the question, and I never said so. Mr. MONK .- If you did not say so the state- ment has been made, and the excuse has been made that there was an agreement on the part of members to give the powers to the Premier by means of which he paid the $40 bonus. That is the position which was taken up-that the Premier used this €40 bonus as an incentive to them to give him the power by which be gave it. An Hon. MEMBER .- Nonsense. Mr. MONK .- Why. on the platform the Premier's own followers made the statement that it was arranged at a caucus ; and not one of them can say that, when voting for the amendment of the Public Revenues Act, he did not know that £40 would be paid by reason of the amendment being carried. Hon. MEMBERS .- Who? Absolutely incor- rect. Name one. Mr. MONK .- And it has also been said on the floor of this House that if the Premier had not intimated the result that would follow that vote they would not have given him that power. An Hon. MEMBER .- Who said that ? 
<page:577>
it was common property in the lobby. I do not want to be personal, but the understanding was that that power which the Premier was obtaining over the Controller and Auditor- General enabled him to pay that bonus. And everybody knows that it could not have been paid without that power being taken. If the Premier desired to pay it fairly- and I am not contending that the sum was too much or too little-but it is the manner in which it was obtained. It was given in a manner in which most honourable members felt that they could not satisfactorily apply it to their personal use ; even those who kept it would rather it came in a less questionable form. Mr. SEDDON .- You thought to bribe the Council. They were to receive the money ; and then, if given to charitable aid, Government would have to subsidise it at the rate of £1 4s. Yet the gift was from the Government, not the member. Mr. MONK .-- I do not want to detain the House by explaining that matter, but the state- ment is incorrect. The entire amount was used by a local body, and justly so ; and I should have been laughed at by the Premier if I had left it in the Treasury. I gave it to the local body so that it might be spent equally in the in- terests of all those from whom I held it had been improperly taken - upon those who opposed me as well as those who supported me. I hold that the #40, if it was right to give it to members, could have been given in the same way as the Premier gave an increase to himself and his col- leagues, and also unnecessarily increased the salary of the Governor. Why should members be subjected to surreptitious treatment he would not inflict on his Cabinet ? Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to say anything unpleasant, but I am afraid that the House had got into that condi- tion that it was the incentive of $40 that made honourable members give the Premier that power over the Auditor-General that he now has under the Public Revenues Act. The Premier would never have got it otherwise. am afraid the House has got demoralised. An Hon. MEMBER .- You are getting down. Mr. MONK .- Down, do you say ? No, I want to keep the House and myself up. There are certain principles that are not to be trifled with. The power taken by the Premier has endangered important liberties, and there is no knowing what he will do next. That was an exceedingly dangerous power to be given to the Premier-the power to control the functions of the Auditor-General by enabling him to pay to members money that he could not other- wise have paid. I quite agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Auck- land City (Mr. Napier), that the House can do what it likes. That is so. It can do anything except to make a man into a woman or a woman into a man. Its powers are unlimited. It could even repeal Magna Charta. Sir, we have not a written Constitution, but there is another Constitution in this land which we should try to exalt and improve, and that is public opinion. I say that the public opinion | impersonal sense, but in principle it is correct. VOL. CXVII .- 36. community was not as to whether the £40 was too much or too little, but whether the Premier was endangering the public weal by a dangerous innovation, and they were amazed that the Premier of a British colony could have the temerity as Treasurer to clothe himself with the power to depose or make void the super- vision of the Auditor-General. I do not wish to say anything more upon this matter. I thought it necessary to give reasons for the objections, particularly against the granting of that money. It was a consciousness of guilt that made the honourable member for Auckland City speak as he did, and he it was who first gave the debate the aspect from which I am now dealing with it. There was no statement made by some members who profess to support the Government against the infringement of privi- leges and recklessness of administration. We speak honestly on this side. I do not say any- thing behind the Premier's back that I hesitate to say to his face. I speak in the interest of public liberty, and not from any personal mo- tive. I feel there is a danger to our country if we permit reckless intrusion on those barriera by which great public interests are protected, and if we do not jealously build and support a public opinion that will act as a safeguard, for we have no other. That is the reason why I have made these few remarks. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- I wish to say at once that I never said a word that reflected on the honourable member. I only know that he, as usual, signed the voucher, took the money, and said nothing about it. Mr. A. L. D. FRASER (Napier) .- Sir, I did not intend to speak on this question at all, but when I find that an honourable member will do as the honourable member for Waitemata, Mr. Monk, has done a few moments ago- level charges broadcast and wholesale at his fellow-members-1 felt that I, for one, could not have any respect for myself if I did not deny those charges. And when the honourable I member stands here in this Chamber and draws upon his imagination to cast a stigma upon members of this House who do not agree with him politically, I think it is the absolute duty of every one of us to rise and throw the lie in his teeth. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- That remark must be withdrawn. Mr. A. L. D. FRASER .- Well, perhaps I have used an unparliamentary term ; but when an honourable gentleman stands up in this House Mr. MASSEY .- Sir, the word objected to has not been withdrawn. Mr. SEDDON .- He said he withdrew it. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- I understood the honourable member to say that he withdrew it. Mr. A. L. D. FRASER .-- Yes, Sir, I with- draw it, and I at once express my regret that I used language that I should not. But the honourable gentleman should not have made the accusations that he did. Mr. MONK. - I used the language in an 
<page:578>
member says that, he does not understand the English language when he accuses us of being bribed by the Premier. Mr. MONK .- I used the word " incentive." Mr. A. L. D. FRASER. - The honourable gentleman accused members of having been bribed, and I say there was nothing of the kind. If there was any incentive about that £40, then the honourable member himself took the £40. If it was dishonest of the Premier to give it to us, it was more dishonest still for the honour- able member for Waitemata to receive what he looks upon as stolen money. Mr. MONK. - I have denied that it was stolen ; but it was improperly obtained. I would scorn to use it for my own use or in any form in which it might be deemed a political bribe. Mr. A. L. D. FRASER .- It is no use the honourable member interrupting me ; because he has brought a hornet's nest about his ears, and will have to suffer the inevitable result. What did he do himself with that £40? He says he offered it to the local bodies of his district. He is accusing us of being bribed, and what did he try to do? He tried to bribe his constituents with this money. Evidently the honourable gentleman is looking forward to another election. I say this : that as far as I know there was no bribery ; there was no bribery by the Premier or by any other member of the Ministry, either in caucus or out of it. Mr. MONK .- I object to that term being used. I never used it. Mr. A. L. D. FRASER .- I hope I shall have your support, Sir, that the honourable gentle- man did use that language. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- The honourable gentleman denies that he used the language. His denial must be accepted. Mr. A. L. D. FRASER .- I accept it, Sir, recognising that the honourable member's memory is very short. I do not wish to pro- long this debate, but I am perfectly certain every honourable member in this House will appreciate what I am now doing, for we are accused here of giving our support to the Pre- mier and his policy not because we believe in the principles of that policy, but because we can be bought-bribed by filthy lucre. We are plainly accused of acting dishonestly, and, as those charges are "as false as dicers' oaths," I say I would not remain in this House if I could not hurl the charge back. I have been before my constituents since the vote was passed, and have given them my reasons for supporting it; and I admit right here that perhaps it would have been better if it had been brought down by statute ; but, as it was brought down, I say it was voted honestly, without intimidation, without influence being brought to bear on us by any individual member of the Ministry. It is not within my power to say what took place in caucus, but if the Hon. the Premier and my fellow - members permit me to do it, I am perfectly satisfied I could demonstrate that what took place there had nothing whatever to do with Parliament it was little enough to give us for the actual services the members of this House render the colony. And who is at this moment the £40 assisting ? There are honourable members in this House who voted against it, yet carefully take it and put it in their pockets. Were they consistent ? No ; they were as inconsistent as the honourable member who has just spoken. We voted for it and we took the money : but practically we did not get a sixpence of it. Whoever has a copper of their honorarium to themselves? Not one sixpence of the hono- rarium goes into the pockets of honourable members. It is all distributed in their elec- torates and throughout the colony generally. Is it suggested for one moment that we are here as professional politicians to make money out of the colony? Take Captain Russell. I take him as an example because he is one that is not prone to flattery ; he voted against that £40. An Hon. MEMBER .- No, he did not. Mr. A. L. D. FRASER .- Well, whether he did or did not, he took that £40, and was con- sistent and honest over it. But the honourable member who contends that the money was cursed, that he did not want it, and then endea- voured to bribe his constituents with it-that honourable member is not one of those whom I appreciate, or one that I will accept as an authority on the ethics of morality. He took it with both hands, and then tried to make political capital out of it against the Govern- ment. He says that he wanted to save the country £40 expenditure, that it was dishonest to vote it, doubly dishonest to take it ; yet he accepted it, and offered it to a local body in the hope of obtaining another $40 subsidy. This is the unalloyed purity as produced in Waitemata. But enough of this nauseating subject, though, in conclusion, I perhaps should express some regret for having imported a certain amount of feeling into this matter ; but I felt that there was a reflection on me individually as a member of this House, and that must be my apology, if an apology is necessary. Mr. MONK (Waitemata) .- I would just like to mention that whatever the honourable mem- ber may say about the matter, he has been making assertions which are not worth con- tradicting, because it is characteristic of some to make assertions they cannot back up ; but I will assert that on those who know most about me all that he has said will have very little im- pression. And as to bribing a future election. I hurl that back on him, not in the coarse terms he used, but I will say emphatically that it is incorrect. Mr. HUTCHESON (Wellington City) .- When this country quits thinking with its belly and resumes the use of its brain we will not want any special pleading or sophistry to let it know that we have got a long way off the track of constitutional government. The Premier said this afternoon, by way of interjection, that no one dared to repeal this Public Revenues Act of 1 1900. I say I would not give my support to any Government that approved of that Act on 
<page:579>
of the conditions of my adhesion that they should at once repeal that Act, which is an iniquitously dishonest Act. Let me show the House what it makes possible. In passing, let me say that I was one who voted against the $40, and I did not buy support with it nor any- thing else, but paid it back into the Public Account. Honourable members will remember that in 1899, in Committee of Supply, the ques- tion of allowances to Mr. Justice Edwards, then acting as President of the Arbitration Court, was raised. The question was raised as to the irregular manner of the payment of the fees, and this took place. Mr. Lewis was the member who drew attention to it, and he said,- " It was unsatisfactory that the House should be asked to vote these fees. If the Judge of the Arbitration Court were called upon to give decisions when public feeling ran high it was possible pressure might be brought to bear upon members of the House by those interested to reject the vote. The mere possibility of such a thing was revolting. "Mr. SEDDON quite agreed that this ought to be fixed by Act, and this was only a tempo- rary arrangement until they could pass an Act next session." And so on throughout the course of this short debate nine times did Mr. Seddon protest that this was only a temporary arrangement, and would not occur again. Mindful of that fact, when this House was dealing with the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act last session it put a certain provision in section 112 of that Act barring the Governor in council from fixing the fees of the President of the Court. Delibe- rately mindful of the promise that Mr. Seddon made and failed to keep, after nine times rea irming the promise, in clause 112 of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act it is provided that :- . The Governor from time to time may make regulations for any of the following purposes. Prescribing what respective fees shall be paid to the members of the Court (other than the President) and to the members of the Board." This House had hardly got away from its duties last year before the Governor in Coun- cil gazetted the fees of the President of the Arbitration Court at two guineas a day for every day while hearing the case or travelling to or from hearing the case. Now, I submit, under the present condition of industrial un- rest, that while that provision obtains those fees must be payable every day of the year if the President of the Court chooses to ask for them. The amount of it does not matter, but there is the fact that the Premier was flouting the deliberate will of this House by the agency of that iniquitous provision in the Public Revenues Act, and there is no im- proper expenditure that cannot be made under the provisions of that Act. Mr. SEDDON. - A Judge of the Supreme Court must be the President. You have fixed that ; that is the law. this anomaly : that the President of the Arbi- tration Court in the whole will draw emolu- ments from fees to the extent of half as much again as the Chief Justice of the colony, and for work very much less in importance than the heavy and onerous duties falling to a puisne Judge in criminal and civil cases. That is one of the potentialities of this Public Revenues Act, and there is no sort of control whatever over the irregular expenditure in the present state of the law. Not only has the Controller and Auditor-General been stripped of a certain amount of statutory power, but his office is practically a laughing - stock and simply a matter of ridicule. I would not contend for one moment that the Auditor-General or any other official in the State should be supreme over Parliament or members; but why have we created the office of Controller, and specially called him by that title of Controller and Auditor General, if we did not intend that he should control the financial matters of the colony on certain given lines? I would appeal to the judgment of honourable members, leaving out the personal element altogether, that this Act is undoubtedly a vicious Act. Supposing the present Government, in whom a majority of the House has still an abounding faith, were removed from office, and some other Ministry got on those bonches, and that those same members, or a portion of them, returned to the House in the new Parliament which succeeds. Mr. SEDDON .- If I were leader of the Op- position I would support any Government or Treasurer in maintaining that Act ; no Govern- ment would be safe on these benches unless that power is given. Mr. HUTCHESON .- I submit that we find ourselves in this position : As the member for Auckland City (Mr. Napier) said, there is no power in the land superior to the supreme will of the people. But what is the supreme will of the people? Let the honourable gentleman put it to the test next year, and go to the coro- nation and leave us here, and see whether he will find it again. He will not see us at all ; we shall be lost, and he will not be able to find us. When the extreme power is vested in the hands of one individual, as practically and dispassionately it is now, there are greater safe- guards than ever required ; and I say, without giving any official the right to maliciously or factiously put any hindrance in the way of the Government, certainly he ought to have statu- tory powers enabling him to question the propriety of any payments whatever. When the House comes to remember that last year was granted a 50 per-cent. increase of the "unauthorised expenditure," when the House comes to remember that every possible contin- gency is provided for in the appropriations of the year, what contingency can possibly arise requiring it to get this unlimited authority in the expenditure of public money. It prac. tically puts the manager of the firm into the position of auditor-the manager of the firm practically sets the auditor at naught, and tells him, " What do you know about it ? You may 
<page:580>
know something about accounts, but you must certify as correct anything I submit to you." It is a farce. I would rather, as the honour- able member for Palmerston said this after- noon, see the office of Controller and Auditor- General abolished altogether, and have substi- tuted therefor the necessity for the Government of the day to place full details of the accounts of the colony on the table of this House. There was a time, I believe, Sir, when every item of expenditure was available to members of this House, even down to the bannister-brush and chamois leather for the windows. There was no such thing as a £1,000 for contingencies or £10,000 for miscellaneous. It is true we are told that when the proper time comes we shall get details of the contingencies; but of what avail are they, and what opportunity have mem- bers to look into the matter when they are submitted at the moment the estimates are being passed ? Now, this is why I have risen to speak : to merely place on record my most emphatic, my most thorough and real, determi- nation that I would not on any account sup- port any Government, no matter what their other policy may be, unless they agreed to repeal the extreme power that is given to the Government of the day to set aside, to drug, to do to death, the watch-dog of the public purse. And that is precisely what the Public Revenues Act has done for New Zealand. I take notice that the Hon. the Premier did not secure the increase of his own and his colleagues' salaries by vote of the House. He placed it on the sta- tute-book ; he made it law in a constitutional way, so that it might remain. He did not do a like act of justice to honourable members. He placed honourable members in a compro- mising and humiliating position, so that it was necessary for them to apologize, more or less, and defend a temporary Act they themselves were made to pass. It would have been more becoming and dignified, and more to the credit of the Ministry and Parliament itself, had it been made statute law, and then there could have been no capital made out of it. Now, I would just like before I sit down to make one reference to the speech of the honourable member for Auckland City (Mr. Napier) this afternoon. I was hoping he would be present in the House. It is somewhat tire- some to honourable members to have to suffer the awful hollowness, the thin veneer of so- phistry, of the honourable member for Auck- land City. In spite of the speech which he was reported to have made in Auckland to his constituents, the sophistry of his words this afternoon-for he used no argument-was pro- truding like the jibboom of a ship; it was so obvious. He prated about the Constitution, he prated about the sovereign power of the people, he prated about the power of control of the representatives of the people, and he said, "Why should we not control the finances? " Now, I ask, why do we deliberately make a Civil List ? Why do we deliberately fix the salaries of the puisne Judges and other high officers of the land by statute ? So that they may not be tinkered with and altered at every whim and Mr. Hutcheson we are to proceed on constitutional lines in this colony in the future that is what this House will revert to. It will not tamper or tinker with Acts that are so important as the Public Revenues Act, but will do what it requires to do in the way of alteration by deliberate statute law. As I have already said, there is not a single law in the whole of our statute-book that cannot now be set at nought and overridden by virtue of this wicked, dishonest Public Reve- nues Act of 1900. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- Before the de- bate proceeds I would like to say that the report of the Committee has gone missing. Has any member the report in his possession ? Mr. NAPIER .- Yes, I have the report. Mr. COLLINS (Christchurch City) .- Sir. the debate . of this evening narrows itself down almost exclusively to the discussion of the amendment made last session in the Public Revenues Act, and I should certainly lower myself in my own self-respect if I allowed this debate to pass without expressing my senti- ments with regard to the discussion that has been raised. Honourable members may re- member that last session I opposed the altera- tion of the Public Revenues Act. I opposed the second reading, I opposed it clause by clause in Committee, and I opposed the third reading. I have not the slightest desire to import any heated feeling into the debate, and I certainly desire to avoid anything in the shape of personalities; but I must confess that if ever any action disappointed me with regard to the party to which I am allied, and to which I hope to remain allied, it was the action taken last year with respect to the Public Revenues Act ; and, although I have listened with great care and attention, I have so far failed absolutely to hear a single reason in what has been said that, to my mind, justi- fies the action taken last session. I have no desire to utter one unkind word in regard to the Ministry, but, Sir, I must confess that my admiration of the Ministry would have been ten-thousandfold increased if I had heard the honourable the leader of the House this session declare that the action taken with regard to this matter was a mistake, as some other matters are admitted to have been a mistake that were done last year. Mr. SEDDON .- I am more convinced than ever of its necessity : and within forty-eight hours you will probably get another reason why the right of review in case of dispute, and that the Governor should finally decide, should be on the statute-book. Mr. COLLINS .- I cannot conceive of any reason in a democracy that would justify the passing of an Act to enable the Treasurer to meet demands that were barred by statute, and that is really what the Act does. An Hon. MEMBER .- NO. Mr. COLLINS. - If the honourable member says " No," he does not understand the nature of the amendment that was made. A great deal has been said to-night with regard to the speech delivered this afternoon by the member 
<page:581>
for Auckland City (Mr. Napier). I had no wish, and no intention, to follow honourable gentle- men who have criticized that speaker, and neither would I have paid attention to it, but that speech has been taken up and indorsed by the Hon. the Minister for Public Works. The Minister for Public Works has practically said "Yea " to everything the member for Auckland City has said. Now, what was said, and what is it that the Hon. the Minister for Public Works has indorsed ? Sir, we are told the pretensions of the Auditor - General were not consistent with a democracy. It is very easy at times to work off a rounded phrase of that kind and imagine that it carries some essential conviction with it, but I would ask the honourable gentleman what he means by the pretensions of the Auditor-General? It is the Auditor-General's duty, I presume, to see that whatever payments are made are made in accordance with the statute law, and surely it is not pretentious on the part of the Auditor- General to refuse payments which he deems are illegal or improper. It appears to me the Auditor-General would be false to his position and wanting in his duty to the democracy if he were afraid to act up to his own con- scientious convictions in seeing that payments were properly and legally made. I am not now saying that payments have been im- properly and illegally made ; but I will show before I have done that payments could be improperly made under the Act as it now stands. We were told that the Public Reve- nues Act restored to the House its proper power, and the proper administration of its functions. That is another neatly rounded phrase that appeared to mean something. Par- liament had apparently been robbed of some necessary power, and had been denied the ad- ministration of its own proper functions. The honourable member must have known when he used those words that it was merely a phrase, and had neither meaning nor effect, and, I might say, it was without sense at the back of it. What does the honourable member mean by restoring to Parliament this power? Are not the statutes upon our law-books the expres- sion of the will of the people through their representatives, and therefore the voice of the democracy? And if a payment has been de- clared improper by the expressed will of this House-by the expressed will of the people of the colony through their representatives in this House-in other words, if the payment is de- clared improper by the expressed will of the people-that is, by the democracy-then, are you to find some back-door way by which this money shall be paid ? I have no wish to make a long speech on this matter. In a short time we shall be discussing the estimates. For the sake of argument, suppose the House is asked to vote for the increase of some particular salary. As long as the amount is passed in the class to which it belongs, then full payment can be made of the proposed increase, even though it be opposed to a statute by which the particu- lar salary has been fixed. The Premier seems to think I am wrong. If I am wrong I shall be glad to be convinced that it is so. The Act of last year provides, - "In any case where any payment of an item is provided for in the estimates as passed by the House of Representatives, and is in- cluded in the total of a vote in the Appropria- tion Act, such payment of the said item may be lawfully made, anything in any Act to the contrary notwithstanding." So that, under the Act, as long as that salary gets through under its class, the class being perhaps taken en bloc, the increased amount may be paid, notwithstanding the vote of the House as expressed by statute. Very well, then. Let me remind the honourable gentleman what I am complaining of is this: he raised the point that we were restoring to the House its proper power and functions-that the position before was not consistent with the proper functions and dignity of the democracy. I ask him again, where are the proper functions and dignity of the democracy shown ? Are they not shown in the statutes? Are they not better shown there than in a number of figures in a list which may be passed on a single vote? I say the proper will of the democracy is expressed in its statute law, and when we fix salaries by statute law that law ought not to be infringed. I am sorry that honourable gentlemen have en- deavoured from the standpoint, particularly, of this Public Revenues Act of last year, to defend that Act ostensibly in the interests of the democracy. I can assure them that when the democracy understands the position they will not thank them for the indignity they are cast- ing upon it - for this besmirching of the demo- cracy. I have something to say of the democracy itself, and I wish to indulge in no high-falutin' language. But if it is to continue to live and to retain its power and position in the minds and hearts of the people ; if it is to do this, it must be clean in its methods, its hands must be clean, and, above all things, it must avoid any possible suspicion of looseness in dealing with the public funds. It is because I desire to prevent any possibility even of the appearance of dealing loosely with the public moneys that I speak. I do not wish to cast suspicion on any person or party. I have no desire to find a single fault with the Administra- tion ; but I do say, in the interest of the demo- cracy, it is, I think, necessary that those mem- bers who hold strong opinions in regard to what was done last session should express their con- victions. I have expressed mine. I hope I have done so free from heat or strong feeling. I took strong exception to the passing of the Bill. I have seen nothing since then to lead me to alter my convictions, and I have heard nothing to-day to cause me to do so ; and I sincerely regret, in the interests of the democracy, which honourable gentlemen themselves have sought to invoke in the course of the debate, the action taken in that amending Act which was placed on the statute-book last year. Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) .- I wish to make a personal explanation in regard to a matter referred to by the honourable member. He stated, in reference to my remark that the 
<page:582>
proper functions and its proper power in the administration of the public funds, that I gave no explanation as to anything of which the House had been deprived. What I was refer- ring to was that for over twenty years the prac- tice had been by the late Auditor-General to accept the general Appropriation Act as a specific appropriation of the items contained in the estimates voted by the House, and the present Auditor-General had taken a new course of not allowing any item to pass which was voted by this House if he considered it incon- sistent with fixed statutory appropriations. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- I crave the indul- gence of the House to refer to a remark of the honourable member for Wellington City, Mr. Hutcheson. That honourable gentleman said that I had made a promise which I had failed to keep. When he made it I did not have the Hansard at hand, but I have now got it. The point at issue was the voting of fees to Judge Edwards, and I spoke as follows :- "This was only a temporary arrangement, until legislation could be passed next year to provide for a Judge of this Court. He quite agreed with the honourable member for Riccar- ton that it ought to be done by statute. They ought to have a Judge of the Supreme Court to act as President of this Court, as it gave con- fidence both to the workers and the employers. If you took an ordinary individual and made him President of the Court, there would not be that confidence. The question now was a temporary arrangement pending the Legisla-  ture dealing with the matter next year. The question would have to be dealt with, either by the appointment of another Judge, or the fixing of the salary to be paid for these services. would have to be dealt with by Act." And after the item had been carried in the House I found that the honourabie member had himself voted for this improper business. I added that it would not continue further until legislation was provided. I provided that legis- lation-not the Public Revenues Act, but the amended Conciliation and Arbitration Act. ] did this as regards the Judges; and under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act we are to-day paying this additional sum-€2 2s. a day-to him for every day he sits. The Act itself fixes his salary at ₺1,500 a year. The promise I made I fully conformed to, and this Public Revenues Act has nothing whatever to do with the matter. The whole thing has been legislated for ; and the House passed it, and, what is more, the legisla- tion referred to was agreed to by the honourable member for Wellington City himself. Mr. ATKINSON .- What section of the Act ? Mr. SEDDON. - I refer to the section of the Act that states that the President of the Arbitration Court shall be a Judge of the Supreme Court. It also states that the President must be paid fees. By two Acts of Parliament you say that the President must be a Judge of the Supreme Court, and, secondly, that you must pay him fees. It would there- fore be contrary to an Act of Parliament if he were to perform his duties without fees. Mr. Napier I rise by way of personal explanation. The Premier accuses me of having voted for this "improper " thing. First of all, I did not at that time consider it was improper, and, further, here is what I said about it :- "Mr. J. HUTCHESON (Wellington City) said it must have been abundantly clear to the Premier for some time that this climax was coming, through the inability of the Judges to keep up to the work. And it was necessary that a special Judge should be appointed for the work." In that respect I agreed with my then col- league for the city, Mr. Duthie, who said : " It appeared to him that if this money were not voted it would render the Judge dependent on the Ministry, and he would therefore rather vote the money." That was the view I took : but that was not where the offence rose. As I said, the Premier promised then nine times that it was only a temporary expedient. That was in 1899. Last year he did not fix by law any increase of salary at all. On the contrary, in the Act that the Premier has quoted to us the only part that makes reference to the payment of fees is section 112, subsection (S), which says,- "The Governor from time to time may make regulations for any of the following purposes : - " (8.) Prescribing what respective fees shall be paid to the members of the Court (other than the President) and to the members of the Board." Thus the wording of the Act directly and distinctly prohibits the payment of fees to the President, because it was thought in- decent to have a Judge of the Supreme Court It dependent upon the Ministry or the House for any emolument in the shape of fees. In-tead of fixing by statute the fees of the Judge of the Arbitration Court, he was deterred by Parla- ment, and what the House objected to was the continuance of the sum on the estimates of last year, which the Premier himself repeatedly and apologetically begged the House to let him get away with. Mr. SEDDON (Premier). - I do not know why the honourable member will continue to wil- fully misrepresent. The reason for taking that vote last session was that the Controller and Auditor-General declined to pass the amount. although we had voted it in 1899. It had therefore to be revoted last year. That is why the Conciliation and Arbitration Act was altered. and the Controller and Auditor-General has ! ! since then raised any questions as to the pa :. ment of the Judge's fees. The payments have been made by an Act of the Legislature, and they will continue to be made. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty). - I went; just like to point out that, with regard to what has been mentioned by the Premier in reste: to Judge Edwards's fees, two returns are shown in last year's estimates. The one is a sum of $500, the other a sum of £331. Mr. SEDDON .- One was in 1899, and :be other was in 1900. AMr. HERRIES .- The sum on the 1 .. 
<page:583>
General was $500, and there was on last year's estimates a further sum of £331 also for the same thing; and I presume there will be a further sum this year in the supplementary estimates. Like the honourable member who spoke last, the honourable member for Christ- church City (Mr. Collins), I was astonished at the speech made by the member for Auckland City (Mr. Napier). I had always considered him to be a Liberal, because when on the plat- form he has always declared himself a Liberal ; but in his speech to-night he certainly gave utter- ance to the most ill-liberal ideas that I ever heard come from a member of the Liberal party, and that is saying a great deal, because I find some of the Liberal members of this House make the most Tory speeches it is possible to find-of a quite out-of-date Tory kind. I understood the honourable member for Auckland City to say that he supported the Premier's Bill because it would allow a vote of this House to have pre- dominance, and that this House ought to be supreme over all the laws of the land. I understood him to say that. The honourable gentleman prides himself on being a great authority on constitutional history, and if he looks back to the past he will find there have been many conflicts between Parliament and the statute law, as interpreted by the Judges of the land ; and Parliament has always come off second best, and the statute law has been shown to be above Parliament. I presume, from the honourable gentleman's utterances, that in the old days he would have been with Grenville and North in the perse- cution of John Wilkes. He would have been on the side of the iniquitous general warrants ; he would have been against the liberty of the Press ; he would have been for prosecuting the six printers in that memorable case which established the liberty of the Press ; he would have been with Castlereagh passing the famous six Acts ; and, in fact, the honourable gentleman would have been found supporting all the vio- lent votes and deeds of Parliaments, overriding statute laws, and against the liberty of the subject. There is no doubt that under the vicious principle the honourable gentleman has set forth, and which he upholds, more injustice and iniquity has been done than under any other system in the world. The idea that this House has power to override the statute law is one of the narrowest type of ideas it is possible to obtain. Look at past history and see the gentlemen who held those ideas and acted on them. Let him look at Grenville and North, who lost the American Colonies ; let him look at Liverpool and Castlereagh, and he will admit, with me, they were Tories of the narrowest type. One could hardly expect ideas of that kind coming from such a member as the honourable member for Auckland City. One would expect him, as a lawyer, to take the bold idea of Chief Justice Holt, who, in the case of Ashby versus White, proclaimed that the privilege of Parlia- ment could not override the statute law of the land, and that the statute law of the land was every man's palladium of liberty, and the privi- One would have expected an honest Liberal to take that idea. I consider myself a Liberal, and I say that the privilege or vote of this Parliament ought not to override the statute law of the colony, but that the statute law of the colony is what every man has to guide him, and is passed for that very object, so that the liberty of the subject should not be subject to the whims of a popular Assembly. Mr. SEDDON .- You should not have taken the money then. Mr. HERRIES .- I took the money because it was voted to me, and I do not think we can gain anything by this bandying of words, whether we took the money or whether we did not. I did my duty in this House. I voted strongly against it, and I would again, and as for the Public Revenues Act I should certainly vote to have it repealed, and I think the Pre- mier should have taken the chance to have it repealed this session. I think he will find that the will of the people is against him on this. The honourable member for Auckland City may say that Parliament is above the will of the people - that was his argument, I believe, that the vote of the House is superior to everything else-but he will find that the will of the country will make itself felt in aftertimes, especially in regard to this Public Revenues Act. Now, with regard to the actual question that is before the House, this report, which has been lost sight of. It seems to me that the Auditor-General, in regard to the "Tutanekai," was perfectly within his rights in putting the tag he did. The "Tutanekai" was used to take certain members of the Volunteers over to New South Wales. That is not a service for which the steamer is usually used ; and I say that the Auditor-General, as custodian of the public purse and the watcher for the public -- he is appointed to watch things for the public, and to see that nothing wrong takes place-it is his duty to call the attention of the House whenever he sees anything he considers wrong taking place. Well, I say that using the "Tutanekai" for that purpose was not one of the things for which the "Tutanekai" was bought, and the Ministry recognised that them- selves. They put on the Treasury vote an amount for expenses with regard to this visit to New South Wales. If they put on that vote, why not make it a larger one ? Why not make it a vote to cover the expenses of the "Tutane- kai." They put the sum of $500 in the miscel- laneous votes of the Treasury Department for these particular expenses that the "Tutanekai" was used for. If they wanted to do right to the country they would have put the whole sum that was estimated for the "Tutanekai " in that vote, and we would then have known what the total expenditure would come to. But instead of that they hung it up in the Marine vote, where no member would have thought of looking for it. If we had seen the sum of £2,000 on the estimates for the expenses of people going to Sydney we would have had a discussion and inquiry into the matter. But instead of that #1,600 was put away in the Marine vote. 
<page:584>
the Auditor for calling attention to the fact that in the Marine vote there is an item for the expenses of the Volunteers to Sydney ; and we also find by looking at the correspondence that there is a doubt in the Marine Department as to whether they could apply for it at all, because, first of all, they applied for it as " Legislative visitors and representatives "-that is the term used-and then, when the Auditor raises objec- tion, they say, "Oh, no; we made a mistake ; it was for the carrying of Volunteers " ; and if that was the case why was not the vote charged to the Defence Department? I quite agree with the member for Bruce that the amount ought to be charged and recoverable from that department -- it ought to be recoverable from them now. The Premier said only $500 was put on the estimates for these expenses. Well, why were not all the expenses occurring put to the same vote? We should see that this sum is put on the present estimates, as that would be the honest and straightforward way of bringing the sum down. Instead of blaming the Auditor for doing the public duty he is put there to do in calling the attention of the House to what he considers wrong, he should be praised ; and this House ought to consider it wrong to manipulate the votes of one department for the benefit of another. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton). - This discussion has ranged so widely that one would almost be justified in regarding it as part of the discussion on the Financial Statement. I was very much surprised, with other honourable  members, to hear the remarks made by the member for Auckland City (Mr. Napier). That honourable gentleman, at any rate in the part of the country where his home is, has always     taken an active part in Liberal matters, and is regarded as a Liberal leader in the Auckland district. It comes, therefore, with a great deal of surprise to hear an honourable member who professes to be a Liberal denouncing as he did this afternoon the actions of the Auditor- General, who holds a statutory position, and has been especially placed in that position for the purpose of acting as the watch-dog of the finances of the colony. Sir, what are the questions that have arisen in connection with this matter? In the first place, the Auditor- General objects to the money for the " Tutane- kai's" Sydney trip being charged against the Marine vote, and it is clear, after reading the remarks of the Auditor-General, that he re- cognises that in spending money on this parti- cular purpose from the Marine vote the Govern- ment were contravening the will of Parliament. The member for Palmerston mentioned this afternoon that the sum of $500 was voted for the representation of this colony at the Federal festivities, and, Sir, I went to my home under the impression that that was the amount that was to be spent. It was with amazement that I found, before I had been home forty-eight hours, that, notwithstanding the fact that the (Government had asked for a vote of only £500 for that purpose, the Premier was actually in cablegraphic communication with the authori- Mr. Herries very large contingent of Volunteers going over for the purpose of taking part in these festivi- ties. Why did not the Premier deal honestly with the House, and tell us when he was asking for that vote that this was only to cover a vote for one or two Ministerial representatives and delegates, and that his real idea was to incur an expenditure amounting to £8,000 or £10,000 in connection with the matter ? Well, the honourable gentleman laughs. Mr. SEDDON .- I am laughing at 9.0. you saying it went to £10,000. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- I think when the time comes you will be able to show how much it is. If you take the amount down in connec- tion with the unauthorised expenditure ; if you take the amount down in connection with the Defence votes, and other votes, and add this to them, you will find it not very far short of £8,000 or £10,000 for the two contingents-the one to Sydney and the other to Melbourne. Sir, I say that the House understood, and the country understood, that the amount of expenses that were to be incurred in connection with the representation of this colony at the Federal celebration was the sum of £500; and it is clear that the Auditor-General desired, when he en- deavoured to stick up this money, to emphasize to the country, as the watch-dog of the finances, that the Government had gone beyond the con- stitutional practice in having taken a vote for only £500, and spending a much larger sum without any authority whatever. I say, in the ordinary course, Governments have to be in- trusted with very large responsibilities so far as matters of finance are concerned ; and I am always prepared to give to the Treasurer, whatever party may be in power, authority to deal with emergencies as they arise, especially when Parliament cannot be con- sulted. But where the circumstances are such as they were last October when that vote of $500 was taken, when the sense of Parliament could be taken on it, then I say it is unfair, it is unconstitutional and improper on the part of the Government to then go and incur a very large expenditure without any authority from Parlia- ment. Now, with regard to the second case in connection with the Bank of New Zealand pre- ferred shares, I am quite prepared to admit that ultimately the colony was bound to recoup itself I that $5,567 in connection with the interest. am quite prepared to admit that ultimately that money must have come into the consolidated revenue to help to pay interest on the money ; but, Sir, the question that was raised by the Auditor-General was as to the legality, and I believe he puts the matter very clearly in Memorandum No. 14, of 1st August, when he says,- " It is generally better to comply with the re- quirements of the law, even in cases where com- pliance may be the mere formality that the Trea- sury seems still to be regarding the payment to the Public Trustee of the money in question." That is the whole point. The Auditor is there for the purpose of seeing that the law is carried out; and surely the Premier is not going 
<page:585>
this colony that men are to go outside the law ? Surely he is not going to assert that the Treasurer, or the Judge, or even the common policeman, whatever may be their personal views, are not to be guided by the law? The Auditor-General in this matter has, I say, been endeavouring to enforce the action of the law, because he has been put there for the purpose of doing so. And, now, what is the proposal of the Solicitor General, Dr. Fitchett ? Why, Sir, the most astounding thing ever I have heard in the way of legal interpretation is when Dr. Fitchett, in order to get the Government into the position that the Treasury wanted to be put into, actually makes a law. It is true that in the Public Revenues Act of last session power was given to the Treasurer to settle disputes between himself and the Auditor. Mr. SEDDON .- We have always had that power. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- Yes, you may have always had the power ; but you did not know you had it, and when you got it in the Bill last session you thought you had got entirely fresh power, and you used it very considerably, because cases of this kind have not occurred before. Now, Sir, coming back to what I was saying : Dr. Fitchett, not being able from the law to give the interpretation the Govern- . ment wanted, actually has to make a law, and he says that certain words should be read in. Here is subsection (2) of section 8 of " The Bank of New Zealand and Banking Act, 1895." " (2.) All moneys received for the said repur- chase of such shares shall be paid to the Public Trustee, and applied by him to the redemption, when due, of the securities authorised to be issued by section seven hereof." But Dr. Fitchett says the wording of the clause should be extended by including these words : "to the extent of the total capital sum represented by all" the securities issued under section seven hereof. He admits the words are not there, but he thinks they should be read in. That is the way Dr. Fitchett gets over the trouble. Now, Sir, I come to what I think is a somewhat characteristic attitude of the Right Hon. the Premier. In the first diffi- culty that occurred between himself and the Controller and Auditor - General the right honourable gentleman is as courteous and as nice as he can possibly be. No. 14 of the correspondence reads thus : " His Excel- lency the Governor is respectfully advised to sign the accompanying instrument," and so on ; signed "R. J. SEDDON." That is the attitude the honourable gentleman takes up at that point. But what is the attitude he takes up a little later ? When we refer to paragraph 25, after the correspondence has gone a considerable distance between the Treasury and the Audit, this is the Premier's memorandum : "Get the Governor's order. R. J. S., 24 1901." Sir, I can quite understand what the feeling of the honourable gentleman was when he penned that short, sharp, and incisive order. That, Sir, was the crack not of the party whip, but of the man who held the whip over the Auditor have the honourable gentleman when he gets to this point-possibly his liver was out of order at the time-issuing the mandate, " Get the Governor's order," and the Governor's order was obtained. Now, a good deal has been said in connection with the Public Re- venues Act of last year. Let me say that so far as the speech made by the member for Christchurch City (Mr. Collins) is concerned I entirely agree with it. There were certain machinery clauses of a very important charac- ter in the Public Revenues Act of last session which were absolutely necessary for the carry- ing-on of the government of the colony ; but there were, in addition to those necessary and desirable clauses, certain other clauses which were objectionable. One of those clauses was clause 3, which gives power to the Government under a vote of the House to override statute law. I think that is a most dangerous prin- ciple to be introduced into our legislation. I indorse every word that was said by the member for Christchurch City (Mr. Collins) with regard to the dangerous character of that. If we consider the numerous safeguards that attach themselves to the passing of a statute -- how it has to be introduced, and read a first, a second, and a third time, and passed through Committee, and then passed through the Upper Chamber, where it goes through the same process, each step being a safeguard -can we, as members of the House, feeling the sense of responsibility we ought to feel, say that a vote of this House, passed in the dying hours of the session, is to be allowed to override and set aside all those solemn safeguards and sanctions that are employed in the passing of a statute? Yet that was done by the Act named. And what, to my mind, is the gravest part of the whole thing is the tremendous power placed in the Premier of the colony, whoever he may be, because in the hands of the Premier, as head of the Government, rests solely the right of initiative in connection with these votes. If Parliament as a whole had the power of initia- ting money votes I would not complain so much; but when I know that the one man in this House who holds the key, who can raise the honorarium of members of the House, who can raise the salary of the Speaker, who can raise the salaries of the Judges - and who can raise the salary of every officer whose monetary compensation is fixed by statute-is the Premier, and that he alone can initiate the vote, I cannot but feel that is a tremendous power to place in the hands of any man, and it is a power that I am not prepared to continue. Something has been said about the repeal of the Public Revenues Act of last session. I am prepared to vote with any man or any party which will go for repealing that power, which will go for repealing the power of the transfer of votes, and which will go for repealing also the power of the Colonial Treasurer to override the powers of the Auditor-General. There is one power in connection with the Public Re- venues Act of last year which has not been referred to, but which I shall show honourable 
<page:586>
the power of the Government to transfer votes. If honourable members will look at the Appro- priation Account, page 6, under the heading " Public Works Department " -- Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER. - I cannot see how that point arises in the discussion which is now going on. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .-- The report of the Committee is that the action of the Auditor- General in one case was unnecessary, and in other cases the Committee recommends that no action be taken. The whole of the powers that are exercised, and that have been exercised, by the Government, and under which that report is brought down, are contained in the Public Revenues Act of last year. Honourable mem- bers have discussed the question of the .£40; I am proceeding to discuss one phase which comes under another clause of that Act. The DEPUTY - SPEAKER. - Honourable members have been discussing the question of a clause under which the Auditor-General acted. I cannot allow other clauses to be discussed. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- I regret exceedingly that I am not allowed to proceed, because if I had been allowed to go on I would have been able to show that the Government have made very large transfers of votes indeed, and that these have been made under the Governor's order, exercised under the authority of this Act. In fact, without wishing in any way to contra. vene your ruling, I may point out that the dis- cussion so far has taken place under the power given to His Excellency the Governor in con-  nection with clause 9, as to their being differ- ence of opinion. I proposed to show another case in which there has been a difference of opinion between the Auditor-General and the Colonial Treasurer, and that this transfer has been made under that very section. The DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- If that relates to papers which have been laid on the table the If it does not honourable member is in order. the honourable member is not in order. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- I am quoting from B .- 2, Appropriation Account. The DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- That is not laid on the table by the Auditor-General under the Public Revenues Act, and is not connected with the report which is now being discussed. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- Then, I presume I can only take another opportunity when I shall be in order in discussing these transfers of votes. However, I am very sorry to hear the Premier expressing so much pleasure at my mouth being closed on this occasion. The Premier has been "hear-hearing" in a manner quite delightful, coming from him, and it shows that he is glad I am prevented from saying what I have to say on this matter. Without wishing to weary the Houses I can only say, in connection with the $40 vote which has bulked so largely in this discussion, I am not going to say anything that ought not to be said ; but I think I shall be correct if I were to say that had the salaries of Ministers not been increased last session this £40 vote would not have been proposed. I am not expressing any opinion as Mr. G. W. Russell of members was too much, nor am I going to refer to what my own personal position was in connection with it. An Hon. MEMBER .- Did you take it ? Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- I did; and I have no doubt my honourable friend did also ; and I think the honourable gentleman in taking the money was within his rights, as I also was. The money was voted by Parliament, and, although I cannot dispute the legality of the payment, because by the statute I have referred to the passing of the money to me and all honourable members was made legal-no one can say it was not legal. I see my friends on the Ministerial benches are passing Hansard along to the member for Masterton in connec- tion with what I did. I voted for the second reading of the Bill because, as I said, I con- sidered the Public Revenues Bill was necessary in the interests of the colony ; it was impossible to carry on the finances of the colony, so far as railways and other important matters were concerned, without it. I did not vote for the £40 vote. Mr. HOGG .- Why ? Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- I will tell the I did not honourable gentleman straight. vote for it because I did not think that £40 should be voted to members in the way it was done. But I will tell the honourable gentle- man that there are two members who would bear me out were they present-I was person- ally waited on by two members, who asked me not to oppose it, and I promised them I would not do so. I kept my promise. Mr. HOGG .- Worse and worse; that was weakness. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- That may be. The honourable gentleman is not a pattern of strength as I usually take it. The honourable gentleman can say whatever he chooses. This is the first time I have spoken on the matter. and I say this: I shall not make any promise like that again, and those honourable gentle- men who came and asked me not to oppose the vote I shall put in a position when the extra vote for this session comes down of having to fight for it. Mr. FISHER .- Why not name them now ? Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- I decline to bandy names across the floor of the House when the persons involved are not present. I can only say this : Regarding what has been said in con- nection with this vote of £40, and the circum- stances that arose for it, if I am to be abused I shall open my mouth a good deal wider than I have ever done as to the circumstances that led up to that £40 vote. Knowing public opinion regarding the matter, the Premier will not dure to do the thing in the same way this time. The Premier is not prepared this session to pro- pose a vote of £40. He knows he has either got to do one of two things-either to let his followers go without the $40 or bring it down by way of statute. I say the fact is recognised by the Government that they made a mistake last year in the way this was done. Mr. HOGG (Masterton) .- I am very sorry 
<page:587>
indeed, Sir, that a discussion of this kind has arisen at this period of the session. If there is anything which honourable members should avoid it is the recriminations, the charges, and the threats that have been indulged in this evening. I know that some honourable mem- bers pretend to have exceedingly clean hands, and now and again they are in the habit of deprecating the conduct of their colleagues ; but if there is anything excessively discredit- able in connection with the voting of the money -- which I believe was appropriated by every honourable member to whom it was offered- Mr. PIRANI. - You are wrong. Mr. HOGG .- I am glad to hear that there may be an isolated case. I have been look- ing in vain for the man who has not taken the money. I hope he will turn up eventually. I say, Sir, that if there is anything peculiarly discreditable in the conduct of any honourable member who has taken something which was spoken of as an inducement to pass a certain Act, the discredit attaches specially to those who, having voted against it, have since endea- voured to wash their hands clean of it in front of the country, and deprecated the action of other honourable members before their consti- tuents, yet have handled the money and made use of it. I would ask, What does the whole of this long discussion amount to? What was the object of the Bill that was passed last session ? What was the difficulty that we had to deal with ? What was provided for in the Public Revenues Act ? Was not that measure virtually the re-enactment of a statute that had been passed over twenty years before ? The provision that so much attention has been paid to this evening is one of a very simple character. Under it, when a dead- lock occurs between the Treasurer and the Controller and Auditor-General on a question of law, the Solicitor-General is called in to settle the dispute and get rid of the deadlock. In a matter of that kind, whose opinion should be taken ? Who is to decide a question of law where there is a difference of opinion as to whether a certain amount of money can be legally paid away or not ? Should it be left to the Auditor-General or the Solicitor-General ? I say, Sir, that the Act very properly provides that the opinion of the Solicitor-General, the legal adviser of the Crown, shall prevail. The Act merely asserts the right of this Parliament when it votes money to see that the votes are fairly appropriated, and that they are used in the way that Parliament intended. It asserts the right of the country to deal with its own revenues, and it provides that the people of the country and the Parliament shall not be placed under the heel of any officer. But, Sir, what does the honourable member for Riccarton say ? He said, " If I am to be abused I will open my mouth wider than I have yet done." I, for one, challenge the honourable member to open his mouth as wide as he likes. What is the meaning of such a threat? Why does he not open his mouth and give us his re- velations ? He refers to two members of this House as having seduced him from giving his vote. I did not know the honourable member was open to seduction before. This innocent member is led away like a lamb to the slaughter. He allows himself to be taken away from the House at the very time when he should have had the manliness to have given his vote for or against the matter that was before Parliament. What does he tell us? That he allowed two members to take him away so that he should not vote on that occasion ! He consented to do a thing which no member who has the courage of his opinions would do, and he leaves a reflec- tion to be cast on every member of the House by refusing to say who were the two members who carried him away captive. If the honour- able member had a spark of manliness in his carcase Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- The honourable member must withdraw that language at once. Mr. HOGG .- I withdrawit, Sir, with pleasure ; and will say that if the honourable member acted fairly towards his colleagues in the House he would not allow a reckless imputation of that sort to remain in Hansard directed against those with whom he has been working during the present session, and for years past. I say it is a very unjust reflection. When the honour- able member assumes such an attitude, and asserts that he has been led to do a thing which he now regrets having done, he should be pre- pared to say who were the members that in- duced him to do so. But, Sir, what did he. do ? He admits that on the second reading he voted for the Public Revenues Bill. He says that the Bill was a measure which should never have been passed. If it was a measure of the kind he declares, and contained the dangerous provisions he referred to, why did he vote for the second reading? And, having voted for the second reading, why does he now come before the House and denounce the measure? I trust there are very few members in the House who having voted for a particular measure would a year afterwards. say, " I did something I should not have done. I allowed myself to be carried away at the time, and supported a measure which I now say is objectionable, and that I should like to see repealed." What reliance is to be placed on a member who takes up an attitude like that -- who votes one day for a measure and the next day deprecates it, and says there is something dangerous in it, and if any one would move that it should be repealed he would assist him ? Is that the attitude an honourable member should take up? I am not at all astonished, because if one honourable member is continually waver- ing in this House from one side to the other it is the honourable member for Riccarton. He has been "everything at times, but nothing long." At one moment he has been an ad- vocate for huge borrowing, and the next time he comes forward and tells us we ought not to borrow. An Hon. MEMBER .- When was this? Mr. HOGG .- Even during this session. Did he not say the Government ought to be satisfied with a million of money for the Advances to Settlers Office, and yet when it was proposed to 
<page:588>
voured to strangle the Bill and prevent any money being voted at all? Is that consistent conduct ? Mr. SEDDON .- It proves the inconsistency of the member. Mr. HOGG .- Of course it does. I am now referring to the Advances to Settlers Extension Bill. I refer to the attitude of the member for I am Riccarton, and not Captain Russell. satisfied the honourable member for Hawke s Bay would never be caught in such a trap. He is too consistent ; he has too good a memory ; he is not a member who oscillates from side to side ; he has that manliness in his composition that compels him to stick true to his colleagues, and not to be con- tinually travelling from one side of the House to the other, denouncing this and that, and casting imputations against every one with whom he comes into contact. That . has been the attitude of the 9.30. honourable member. You never find him stable in regard to any matter he takes up. He is as unstable as water. He is a persistent rail-sitter, and that is the reason why he has lost his influence in this House. The honour- able member gets up on every possible occasion and deprecates the measures of the present Government. Why? Because the Government refuses to take him by the hand, and because Ministers and members have discovered that he is one of those self-styled independent repre- sentatives on whom no one can depend for a moment. I think time enough has been taken up over this debate. I would have been very pleased if a discussion of this kind could have been avoided altogether. I do not think it is elevating or profitable to indulge in the acri- mony that has been displayed this evening. I think we ought to pass on to more important business, and leave debates of this kind severely alone. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) .- I think, Sir, if the Premier would only admit it, he is sorry now that he did not take my advice, tendered early in the evening, to follow the usual custom of going on with the orders of the day at half- past seven. A great deal of time has been occupied with this debate, and a great many things have been said that would perhaps have been better left unsaid. The debate has taken an unexpected and somewhat acrimonious turn ; but in saying what I have to say, particularly with regard to the £40 bonus, I wish it to be distinctly understood that I do not reflect in the slightest degree on any member or members of this House. Every man, Sir, is the keeper of his own conscience, and the matter of the $40 bonus is, first of all, a matter between the man and his conscience, and, in the second place, a matter between the member and his constituents. So far as I am personally con- corned-and this is what I want to say-I was not present in the House last session when the Public Revenues Bill came before the House, and when the supplementary estimates came on. Had I been here I should have voted both against the Public Revenues Bill and against the #40 bonus. Mr. Hogg statement which has just been made by the honourable member for Masterton, that 1 de- clined to take the money. But it has been stated by several members to-day that the payment of the £40 bonus would have been possible without the passing of the Public Revenues Act last year. Surely such honour- able members have not read clause 3 of that Act. I will quote it. Clause 3 says, -- " In any case where any payment of an item is provided for in the estimates as passed by the House of Representatives, and is included in the total of a vote in the Appropriation Act, such payment of the said item may be lawfully made, anything in any Act to the contrary notwithstanding, and the said payment shall be deemed to be irrespective of any appropria- tion or limit contained in any such last- mentioned Act : Provided that in no case shall the amount so paid exceed the total sum of the item voted : " Provided further that this section shall apply only to payments which could not law- fully be made if this section were not in operation." That is to say that the section which I have just quoted applies to payments which are fixed by Act of Parliament-to such payments as the salaries of members of Parliament, the salaries of statutory officers, and the salaries of Judges of the Supreme Court. Now, Sir, the salary of members of the House of Repre- sentatives is fixed at $240 a year, and of the Legislative Council at $150 a year, and with- out passing the clause I have just quoted it would not have been possible to have paid the £40 bonus, because it would have been the duty of the Auditor-General to have disallowed it : but with the clause I have just quoted the Controller and Auditor-General, a gentleman with whom I am not acquainted personally, but whom I believe to be a thoroughly conscientious man and a good officer, is powerless to prevent abuses. The Auditor-General is a statutory officer, appointed by Parliament to be the guardian of the rights of Parliament, and to see that payments are legally made ; but with the Public Revenues Act of last year the Auditor- General is almost completely at the mercy of the Treasurer for the day. Then, we have heard from a member who ought to know better-a member who poses as a legal au- thority in this House - that an item when passed by this House is equal to a law. Sir, there is no analogy between an item so passed and a law. An item which has been passed by this House becomes part of a vote in the Appropriation Act, and is not again considered by itself; but a law requires the consent of the three branches of the Legislature-that is, the consent of the Lower House, of the Legislative Council, and the Governor -- and without the consent of all three the law cannot go on the statute-book. An item of the estimates is con- sidered by this House, but is not again con- sidered by the Legislative Council. It simpiv becomes a part of the Appropriation Bill, which is considered as a whole. But, Sir, that is only

the House. I heard the Premier, in the early part of the afternoon, contradict the member for Wakatipu when that honourable gentle- man stated that clause 9 of the Public Reve- nues Act had not been law until last year. Perhaps the honourable member for Waka- tipu was not quite correct in his statement that it had never been the law, because sec- tion 9-and I am dealing with that part of it which refers to disputes between the Auditor- General and Treasurer, and which provides that such disputes shall be determined by the Trea- surer and then referred to Parliament-was the law from the year 1872 to the year 1878, and almost in the same words in which it is law at the present time. I want to quote both sections by way of comparison. I am quoting now the Act of 1872, which says,- " In case any difference of opinion shall arise between the Commissioners and the Treasury as to the vote or other authority to which any expenditure ought to be charged, the question shall be determined by the Colonial Treasurer ; but the objections made by the Commissioners shall be by them laid before Parliament within ten days thereafter, if Parliament be then in session, and if not, within ten days after the next meeting of Parliament." An Hon. MEMBER .- What is the present Act ? That was repealed in 1878. Mr. FISHER .- Finish that section in the Act of 1872. Mr. MASSEY .- I am not dealing with the question of law ; I am simply referring to questions which are determined by the Trea- surer and referred to Parliament. I will quote from the Act of last vear, which says,- "9. In case any difference of opinion arises between the Audit Office and the Treasury as to the vote, appropriation, fund, account, or other authority to which any expenditure ought to be charged, or as to the proper head of revenue, fund, or account, to which any receipt should be credited, the question shall be de- termined by the Treasurer, and his determina- tion shall be laid before Parliament as provided by section fifty three of the principal Act : " Provided that if in the opinion of the Audit Office the question involves matter of law, then it shall be determined by the Gover- nor. having before him the opinion of the Attorney-General thereon; and in such case the objection of the Audit Office, the opinion of the Attorney-General, and the determination of the Governor shall be laid before Parliament as provided by section fifty-three of the principal Act." Sir, the two clauses are the same thing in meaning and almost the same in words. Now, Sir, coming back to the section I have quoted from the Act of 1872, that was repealed in 1878, and by whom ? By the Grey Government, and when Mr. Ballance was Treasurer, and on the motion of Mr. Ballance. And what an extra- ordinary position it is that we find that clause re-enacted-by whom ? By the Government of which Mr. Seddon is the head-Mr. Seddon, the of Sir George Grey. Mr. SEDDON .-- That shows consistency. Mr. MASSEY .- It is the extreme of in- consistency. Mr. SEDDON .- He was Treasurer in 1872. Mr. MASSEY .- I know who was Treasurer in 1878: Mr. Ballance was Treasurer in 1878, and he moved the repeal of that clause I have just read. Now, Sir, I have only one more point to deal with. I heard the Premier say there was no one in this House who would dare to repeal the Public Revenues Act. Pro- bably the House as a whole would not repeal it, but I can speak for myself. I say I would be only too glad of the opportunity, and when the opportunity offers I shall be found voting for the repeal of what I consider to be probably the most iniquitous Act ever placed on the statute-book of this country. Mr. ELL (Christchurch City) .- Last session, when the Public Revenues Bill came down, I voted against the second reading, and I voted against every division in connection with it. I did so, Sir, for this reason : I saw that certain extra powers were being placed in the hands of the Executive, and that it was placing them above this House. Too much power already is centred in the Executive. For the same reasons that I have voted against the Execu- tive having the power to put any vote they thought fit upon the estimates, and so over- ride the statute - law, I have for some years now fought for the right of this House to elect the Ministry, in order to have a stronger grip over them. It seems to me, Sir, that it is foolishness to talk about no extra power hav- ing been placed in the hands of the Executive in this Chamber with the passing of this Act, be- cause we have had, not only last session but this session, instances where, when a member has brought in a Bill that dealt with the revenue, even to such a small extent as happened last year -I refer to the Bill introduced by the member for Wellington Suburbs, which involved a loss of revenue of #168 odd-the Colonial Treasurer rose in his place and objected to the progress of that Bill because it infringed the functions of the Cabinet. Sir, do we want any more evidence that there is power above this House in the hands of the Cabinet by the fact of a member of the Government having that power, when even a Minister can get up and protest against a Bill going forward involving the paltry amount of #168 because it interferes with that amount of revenue ? That was the effect in regard to this Bill. Sir, it is all very well to say that these votes come before the House ; but before they come before the House how do they get on the estimates ? They have to be put there by some representative of the Crown, as they are always pleased to term it. We cannot put any vote on ; we cannot move any proposition to increase any vote by any amount. We can only vote to reduce. We cannot place any sum on the estimates with- out the consent of the Crown, and so, to my mind, it behoves this House to very jealously guard its rights and privileges. But, Sir, 
<page:590>
Revenues Act of last session we yielded a power into the hands of the Executive. We had no right to yield it, and I trust the day is not far distant when some of the most important provisions of that Bill will be repealed, so that the Government or the members of the Cabinet will not have the power of placing a sum on the estimates, and so overriding the statute law. I regret that in the discussion that has taken place to-night there has been a personal ele- ment which has introduced a deal of acri- monious discussion and heart-burning, which may, perhaps, sink deeply into the minds of members. It is always a regrettable thing to me to hear a heated and personal debate crop up in this House. Mr. G. J. SMITH (Christchurch City) .- Sir, I did not intend to take any part in the debate to-night, as I was not here when the Act was passed last year, but I would like to say that, so far as the constituency of Christchurch is concerned, I believe the measure meets with very strong disapproval. If I had been in the House when the Bill was going through I should undoubtedly have voted against the provision of the Act which gives power to the Ministry to override the decision of the Auditor-General. I was not a member of the House, however, and therefore had not the opportunity. As regards the question of the bonus of $40, which has been referred to to-night, I think it is a pity the matter has been brought up. The subject was fought out on the floor of the House last session. Members voted as they felt inclined,  and I suppose they have justified their votes to themselves and to their constituents. I do think the Premier ought to give the House a chance this session to reconsider its decision so     far as the Public Revenues Act is concerned. If he does so, and the present Act should be confirmed, then his position is strengthened. From the expressions of opinion I have heard in the House, however, I am con- vinced that there are a number of members who regret the vote they gave in connection with the Act last year. I cannot see how the House can possibly justify the passing of three or four of the sections of this Act. The neces- sity has been shown again and again of having the Auditor-General, an officer of the State, who is superior to the Ministry, and whose duty it is to keep the expenditure within legal bounds. Yet. the Parliament of New Zealand has introduced and passed an Act taking away the powers of the Auditor-General, and making it practicable for members of the House, by their own vote, to override the statute law and benefit themselves personally. I cannot con- ceive how it was possible for members of the House to pass such a section, and if I can get the chance of voting in favour of its repeal I shall join with those members who have ex- pressed their opinion against the Act to-night. I was not in the House at the time, and there- fore I had not the opportunity of voting when the Bill was going through ; but I wish to put on record my opinion that that Act, or those particular sections of it referring to the Mr. Ell passed. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City). - Sir. at last I breathe a sigh of relief. Without rhyme or reason we have been compelled to listen to a purposeless and irritating debate which has wasted the whole of the afternoon and the whole of the evening. We have been treated to another act of "Les Miserables." When those dwellers in caves on the Opposition side of the House emerge from their state of gloom and inflict on us their dismal jeremiads they give me the impression that they have been living continuously on a diet of mustard and water. They make grimaces and squirm with discomfort as if their internals were not in first-class order. Sir, what is the effect of all this discussion? There is absolutely no effect. The benefit is nil. As well put a linseed poultice on a stone horse. Half the debate is made up of personal explanations and recrimi- nations. How does that benefit the Pariia- ment or the people ? The business is to discuss the report of the Public Accounts Committee. We have not discussed the report of the Public Accounts Committee. We have instead dis- cussed all subjects which come anywhere within a thousand miles of the four corners of the Public Revenues Act. We have had a rechauds of the £40 vote of last session, a dispute abou: the labour legislation and the amount paid to the President of the Arbitration Court, and the Deputy-Speaker, in a thoughtful and timely way, prevented the member for Riccarton inflict- ing upon us a debate upon the general finances of the country. Let us come to the report of the Public Accounts Committee, and, first, the remarks of the member for Palmerston upon the report. The honourable member said the re- port of the Committee was not complete because the minutes of evidence were not laid on the table with it. The member for Wakatipu com- plained that the report had not been presented early enough, and to that the member for Palmerston added that the Chairman was directed by resolution of the Committee to present the report a fortnight ago. No such direction was given. There is no entry of the kind in the minutes. The last meeting of the Committee was held on the 14th August-eight daysago-and throughout the minutes, from first to last, there is no direction in regard to laving the report on the table. I laid the report on the table to-day in deference to a request from the member for Wakatipu, but personally I wished to delay the presentation of the report until the Public Trustee had corrected his evidence, so that I might satisfy the desire of the member for Bruce, who says the evidence should have been laid on the table. Between those two honourable gentlemen what was I to do ? First I pleased the member for Wakatipu : then I displeased the member for Bruce. Is it possible to please these two honourable gentlemen ? Absolutely, no; it is not. The member for Palmerston says the report is a bald report. What did he want? Five dis- tinct cases, as set out in parliamentary paper B .- 19-called Paper No. 59 in the order of re- 
<page:591>
several separate days. In four of the cases, which were comparatively unimportant, the Committee arrived at the uniform decision, " That the Committee sees no reason for pro- ceeding any further in this matter." In the fifth case, the main case, involving a question as to whether the interest-£5,657 10s. 6d .- on a sum of £500,000 should have been paid to the Government or to the Public Trustee, the decision was, " That, in the opinion of this Committee, the action of the Controller and Auditor-Gene- ral was unnecessary, as the moneys were pro- perly paid into the Treasury." Is that a bald report ? The Committee said all that it was necessary to say. What more could it say? But the member for Wakatipu says the report is a censure upon the Controller and Auditor- General. Why is it a censure upon the Con- troller and Auditor-General? The Committee merely expresses the opinion that the Controller and Auditor-General was wrong in his conten- tion, and the Controller and Auditor-General must be left to take his own interpretation from that. But has anything wrong been done? The Colonial Treasurer has done exactly what was done by Sir Julius Vogel in 1872. The mem- ber for Palmerston admits the historic parallel. It might be argued that because Sir Julius Vogel did something wrong in 1872, the present .Colonial Treasurer is not justified in doing the same thing now-that two blacks do not make a white. But that is not the point. The point is, according to the member for Palmerston, the member for Bruce, and the member for Wakatipu, that the present Colonial Treasurer has done something unprecedented, something heretofore unheard-of, and that the finances of the country and the responsibilities of Parlia- ment are not safe in the hands of those honour- able gentlemen. That is the charge. The charge is that the Government ought not to have the power to settle a " difference of opinion "-that the Auditor-General should reign supreme. Now, here is the Public Revenues Act of 1872. I cannot see the least difference in the two positions. The side-note to section 7 of the Act of 1872 is this : " Difference of opinion, how · determined," and the section says,- " In case any difference of opinion shall arise between the Commissioners and the Treasury as to the vote or other authority to which any expenditure ought to be charged, the question shall be determined by the Colonial Treasurer." The Public Revenues Act passed by this House last year does not give the present Colo- nial Treasurer anything like the power given to Sir Julius Vogel. The section goes on to say, -- " .- but the objections made by the Commis' sioners shall be by them laid before Parliament within ten days thereafter, if Parliament be then in session, and if not, within ten days after the next meeting of Parliament." Now, here is the proviso to the clause, omitted by the member for Franklin because, as he said, it applied only to the question of law. That is a very superficial view. The proviso supplies the key to the whole position. It governs all. It is the master power. It says this :- missioners the proposed mode of charge is illegal, the opinion of the Attorney-General shall be taken, and the matter shall then be decided by the Governor in Council." That is identically what is done under the Public Revenues Act of last session. The ques- tion is referred to the Solicitor-General and ultimately to the Governor in Council. If any member of this House can see the least distinction in the forms prescribed to be taken by the then Colonial Treasurer, Sir Julius Vogel, and the form introduced into the Public Revenues Act of last session, then that honourable gentleman possesses a microscopic power which would defy the research of any Then, suppose the microscopic instrument. Act to be defective, suppose it to be wrong in principle in giving absolute power to the Colonial Treasurer or to the Government-as those honourable gentlemen suggest-who is to blame for that? Do we stand here to-day to review the acts of those gentlemen who sit on the Government benches ? Not at all. In re- viewing the provisions of the Public Revenues Act of last session we are reviewing not the acts of those gentlemen who sit on the Government benches, we are reviewing the acts of the Par- liament, for which the members of the Oppo- sition are as much responsible as the gentle- men who sit on the Government benches. No single member-no special body of members- is responsible for the passing of the Act. The Parliament as a whole is responsible, and those gentlemen must share their responsibility ; therefore those who rail at the Government for the inclusion of this provision in the Act in reality blame themselves. First of all, the votes must pass through Committee of Supply. There is the first opportunity for objecting to them. The votes are then reported to the House. There is another opportunity for objecting. Then the votes are included in the Appropriation Act. The Appropriation Act is the last Act of the session. It comes before Parliament as a whole for final review, when the whole of the Acts of the Parliament for the session are reviewed by Parliament and the people. So that the increase in the amount of members' salary over and above the amount fixed by special Act is overridden by the Appropriation Act, which is the final decree of Parliament. Where were the objections then ? At every stage opportunity was afforded for discussion and ventilation. Yet those honourable gentlemen took the #40 and were dumb. They should for ever after have held their peace. Now we are asked to listen to a rechauffe .of all the proceedings of last session-of all the acts in which they them- selves took part. We are now asked to join with them in their pious indignation, and to condemn the Government for what I leave they themselves assisted in doing. these honourable gentlemen on the horns of that dilemma. Let us come again to the statement that the report of the Public Accounts Com- mittee is a censure upon the Auditor-General. That is the view only of persons opposed to the Government. I say the provision introduced 
<page:592>
was an absolute necessity. The provision was avowedly and designedly inserted to enable the Government to transact the business of the country-to prevent the ordinary daily business of the country from being " bailed up " by the Auditor-General. I have not the least desire to make any attack on the Auditor-General. I speak without the least warmth of feeling, but I say, and I say it strongly and with full deliberation, that the idiosyncrasies of that gentleman are such that it would be impossible to transact the business of the country unless the Government were armed with such a power as is contained in the Act of last session. Now, speaking from a knowledge of the history of this Parliament for the past thirty years, I say there never was a time when the tension be- tween the Auditor-General and the Government was so great. I am speaking now in quite an impersonal sense. I am not speaking of this Government or of this Auditor-General. Sir, we had in the predecessor of the 10.0. present Auditor-General a man of commanding intellect-a man who took a high and broad view of his duties and responsi- bilities. He did not take out his magnifying- glass to see whether there was a comma here or a comma there. He took from the spirit of the Act its broad interpretation. He applied to the machinery of the Act the hand of a master, so that the Government could carry on the business of the country with justice, with facility, and with ease. In the case of such a man, I would give him all the powers the Act intended him to exercise as a patent officer, with the view of assisting the Govern- ment and protecting the Parliament; but I would not confer those powers upon every man,  #cc-zero irrespective of the capabilities and the tempera- ment of the individual. I would not grant those powers to a man of peevish nature, who would suddenly call upon the Government to back engines - to stop the machinery of government-in order to consult Parliament upon some pragmatic or pernickety point which any large-minded man would settle In the case of a man in a few minutes. like James Edward FitzGerald, I can under- stand that he should have power to say " No," as the member for Wakatipu puts it, and that when he said "No" the Govern- ment should understand that the interests of the colony demanded that the dictum of the Auditor-General should be respected. I draw a wide distinction between the character of mind and the qualifications of the two men. Now, the honourable member for Bruce, in speaking of the $40 vote and other votes, said that these things could not have been done except for the alteration of the Public Revenues Act, by which the Governor in Council was allowed to step in and say that certain payments should be made, notwithstanding that Parliament had made no provision for such payments. Sir, it was a wise act on the part of this House to empower the Governor of the colony so to intervene. The honourable member for Wakatipu also told us that the Auditor-General was a person whom Mr. Fisher My contention is that the point of impingement is as to the qualifications and the temperament of the man. We have it said that the Solicitor- General and the Public Trustee are against the Auditor-General. That is true. The Solicitor-General and the Public Trustee are barristers of the Supreme Court of New Zea- land. Why are they against the Auditor- General ? Is it suggested that they oppose the opinions of the Auditor-General to gratify some personal feeling ? Surely that cannot be. They have given their professional opinions with a due sense of their professional status, and without any regard to their personal or pri- vate feeling toward the Auditor-General. The fact that these eminent barristers are op- posed to the views of the Auditor-General goes to show-and their view is confirmed by other able lawyers - that indubitably the Auditor-General must be in the wrong. And then comes the consideration which ought to guide the House in this matter. It is this: In a nutshell, the Auditor-General declines to accept the decision of any lawyer in this land. What, then, is the position of the Government ? They take the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown. That is of no avail. They are so hampered by these tags and interrogatories which come from the Auditor-General's office that the business of the Government is brought to an absolute standstill. To strengthen their position and to insure that they shall do nothing wrong they take the opinion of emi- nent counsel outside the Government depart- ments. Well, what effect has that upon the present Auditor-General ? Mr. SEDDON .- None whatever. Mr. FISHER .- And yet one can plainly see. from what takes place at the meetings of the Public Accounts Committee, that if the Govern- ment-and I am very careful not to give any personal tinge to what I say- if the Government had not incorporated that power in the Act of last session it would have been absolutely im- possible to transact the business of this country with safety to the country. The time of the Public Accounts Committee is wholly taken up with these needless objections of the Auditor- General - and, at the risk of wearying the House by iteration and reiteration, I am careful to say that I have no personal feeling again i the gentleman who holds this office ; but it is these irritating objections, in which few can ste any point or purpose except to cause friction between Government and Parliament, that ute objects to. Then, Sir, I ask if it is right that the business of the country shall be constantly stuck up in this way? If the objections were urged in any wide spirit no member of the Committee would offer the least objection. The member for Palmerston says that the Public Accounts Committee is the Government's public cemetery. I do not see much point in the remark. The Public Accounts Committee is useful in this sense, if in no other : It disposes of these eccentric points which are continually being raised by the Auditor-General ; it enables the Government to go on with the business of 
<page:593>
safety does not lie in the hands of His Excel- lency the Governor, with whom rests the ulti- mate appeal, in whose hands does safety lie ? Sir, I do not wish to weary the House by any further rebuttal of the arguments which have been used, but I say that the objections of the Auditor-General had reached such a stage that the intervention of Parliament was abso- lutely and essentially necessary. I hope the House will not repeal the provision introduced into the Act of last session. Indeed, I go further, and I express my confident belief that the House will not alter that Act. If it did it would be a bad day for the Government and for Parliament itself. As I have said, the only effect of these flimsy objections-for I cannot help so characterizing them-is that which I have already described. We have wasted the whole day in beating the air and discussing objections arising out of the re- port that any level - headed business man would dispose of inside half an hour. These are matters upon which we have sat days and days discussing upon the Public Accounts Committee, and we have now wasted a whole day of the time of Parliament-with what result ? Every officer of the Government whose duty it is to do so has signed every document in connection with these five cases. The trans- actions are completed and the money is paid. Then, what is the use of this unnecessary fuss? It may gratify certain members of this House to support the opinions entertained by the Auditor-General, so that they may harass, worry, and annoy the Government by getting up these recriminatory discussions. As to their usefulness to the country, the benefit is absolutely nil. As to that grand old gag about the composition of the Com mittee, it is probable that we shall hear the last of that about the time when we hear the Angel Gabriel's trump.

On the question, That the amendments be agreed to, Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said,-I presume some members will have a few words to say on the third reading of this Bill. I do not think they will allow it to pass without saying something. I myself will not do any- thing to provoke debate, but I do think it is right and proper that I should set at rest some statements that were made in Committee, and show how far all those statements, that were made in good faith, were absolutely wrong, and likely to put this colony and the depart- ment in a very peculiar position. I ought also to say that I was rather surprised, after what had occurred on the second reading, at what eventuated in Committee. Though there were, of course, members who objected to the two millions, there was a general consensus of opinion that one million was sufficient. I can- not say the honourable member for Hawke's Bay was inconsistent. He did not so far com- mit himself as to say that he thought we could do without anything, or with a very small amount, after what he had stated on the second reading ; but there were some members who distinctly stated that they would be prepared to support a million, and those members, when the Bill got into Committee, we found support- ing a lesser sum. Now, I do not think that is fair to the leader of the House, and I think it is likely to prove very embarrassing in respect of so important a question as that of advances to settlers. I will refer first of all to the honourable member for Patea. He said, "I certainly object to the two-million loan which is asked for, but I will not oppose a million loan, because the Act is on the statute-book, and it would cause a great deal of additional trouble to settlers in the back blocks if they could not obtain further advances." What, therefore, the honourable member said on the second reading of the Bill was that he was prepared to support a million loan ; and then we find him voting for half a million. There is a good deal of inconsistency about such a proceeding as that, and more particularly when, as I understand, before his constituents he pledged himself to do his best to support and to promote this Advances to Settlers. Of course, I will not dwell upon that : the member is young and inexperienced, and may have been led astray by the sophistry of some other members. Then I come to a member who is not likely to have been so led astray. On the second reading of the Bill I find the honourable member for Riccarton said, " I only wish to say that, in view of the fact - - 
<page:594>
ing from ? Mr. SEDDON. - From my notes. "-that if the Government is invested by the House with power to borrow one million in addition to what they hold in hand, the effect will be to give them a thorough and an assured finance so far as next year's Advances to Settlers Department finance is concerned, and the probable necessities of borrowers, there is no chance of people coming and asking for money and not being able to obtain it. I shall therefore vote for any motion that may be made for the purpose of reducing the amount borrowed under this Bill to the sum of one million." Now, did the honourable member vote for one million? No, Sir. Although he said it was necessary for an assured finance that a million of money should be taken, we find him voting for the motion of his namesake the honourable member for Hawke's Bay for half a million. So much for his consistency, and as to how much you can rely upon any- thing said by the honourable member for Ric- He is absolutely unreliable. carton. 11.0. He cannot help it, and I am sure that no one regrets it more than himself. At all events, it is only right I should put on record the honourable member's statement on the second reading of the Bill. and compare it with his actions in Committee. And if any honourable member will look at the votes given in Com- mittee it will be seen he voted not only to reduce the amount to half a million, but that he wished to further embarrass the department, and put it in such a position that it would not  be able to raise the money it required. We also found him proposing that we should not borrow more than half a million in any one year. If that had been agreed to, and a favourable oppor tunity were to arise at the end of this year for raising one million, we were not, according to the honourable member's view, to take advantage of it. I will now take the honour- able member's figures, as given by him in Committee and on the second reading of the Bill. Hesaid that between the 31st March this year and the 31st March next year there would be $795,000 available. The total he gave was $935,000, less £140,000 of temporary advances, leaving available $795,000. That was the honour- able members statement on the second read ing, and he repeated it in Committee. anything, I think that the sum grew larger in Committee. The fact of the matter is that, when the honourable member com mences to deal with figures, they grow with him until he is surrounded by them. He has them from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet, more particularly if their enlargement will tend to depress honourable members, or to make his arguments conclusive. It seems to me he speaks for the sake of argu- ment, and cares little or nothing for the figures. Ho . ever, I can only repeat what I said at the commencement of the debate. Some members attempted to make capital against my colleague who is in charge of the Advances to Settlers Well, although he administers Department. I would point out that this is really a question of finance, and, this measure being truly a financial one, I am supposed, as Colonial Trea-  surer, to know the financial aspect of it. I stated on the second reading, and also in Com- mittee, that there was a sum of £760,000 of the last loan-money against which debentures had not been issued. I spoke the truth; it was absolutely so: but honourable member. either  cannot or will not realise that you can olxtain temporary advances against any advances you have the power to raise, and there have been temporary advances obtained against this 1 amount. An Hon. MEMBER .- What amount ? Mr. SEDDON .- To the amount of £140,000. I told the House there was a sum of $560,000 available. An Hon. MEMBER .- That will not add up. 1 Mr. SEDDON .- I will show you in a few 1 minutes how it will add up. The member for Riccarton also said that a sum of $200,000 had gone missing. "If they have that £200,000," he said, "it means they have more money available. They have taken that £200,000 and used it for other purposes." Well, I have \-- - already told the House, and I now repeat it, that £140,000, and subsequently amounts up 1 to $90,000, were advanced to the Advances to Settlers Department for the purposes of the department. I have said so repeatedly, and I cannot understand how it is that members will not understand that. It was not money advanced by the Advances to Settlers Depart- ment to any Government department or to the Treasury, but it was money advanced by the  Bank of New Zealand against temporary ad- vances, and in anticipation of our raising the #160,000. Some members said they wanted to know about that. I assured the House on the second reading of the Bill that there had been no advance to a department. I said that the money had been used for no other purpose than i the Advances to Settlers Department, and this money has been advanced to the settlers. That is where the money went to; and there is the complete answer to what was stated by honour- able members opposite and by the member for Riccarton. There was a further advance of $90,000, another temporary advance of $40.000. Now, you see, I put it against myself. There If was an advance of £140,000, then amounts up ! to $90,000-that is $230,000 -- temporary ad- vances made by the Bank of New Zealand to the Advances to Settlers Department, because we did not think it wise or prudent to issue the loan for the full amount available-$760,000 debentures - permanent loan. The honour- able member will see that, with all his astute- ness, he lost the run of $30,000. At all events, I have now brought it down to $530,001, instead of $560,000, as I stated. So I was ¥30,000 against myself. There was $760.000 of the unraised loan available that we could have raised; but against that we had s temporary advance amounting to $140.0001. and this was made on the authority of short- dated debentures. That reduced the amount 
<page:595>
vance totalling $90.000, advanced by the reduced it to a million," and my answer is Bank of New Zealand, and it reduced the . "Yes." And why ? amount to #530,000. Then, I stated further that I thought the total amount available on the 31st March next would be $49,000. So as to make sure of that, since the House was in Committee I have asked the Super- intendent of the Advances to Settlers Office to confirm or otherwise the statement made, and his statement is that there will not be $100,000 of loan money available, unless further authority is given on the 31st March next. I suppose we shall have honourable members telling us that the head of that important department does not know any- thing about it. It is a question whether you are to take the Treasury and the head of the departinent, or the member for Ric- carton or the member for the Bay of Plenty and others, who know all about it. Members have the statement submitted to the House up to the 31st March, and it is impossible to know what has been done since ; there is no official record. You cannot alter the facts, which are as I have told you. Then, I was told I might rely on the receipts from repayments, and this amount was put down by the honourable member for Ha ke's Bay and others at #175,000. What are the facts ? " It is idle to place any reliance on repay- ments which may be made by mortgagors, as the amount fluctuates in any given month from nil to $10,000."  " A very nice cup of tea," for a big lending department to be dependent on refunds that may never take place, and which the Superin- tendent of the department tells me vary from nothing to $10,000. An Hon. MEMBER .- Will you lay it on the table ? Mr. SEDDON .- I do not want to keep any- thing back from the House. Anything I give the House you may take as being absolutely correct. I have been speaking from the book all along. I cannot understand why there has been any doubt. I am prepared to lay on the table a statement showing that there was loan authorities for only $760,000 not drawn against on the 31st March last, that there was #140,000 advanced by the Bank of New Zealand on short-dated debentures, that there was £90,000 advanced on short- dated debentures, and from this it will be seen there was $530,000 available. Having now given the House this information, it will remove, I think, the doubts there were in the minds of honourable members, raised prac- tically by some honourable gentlemen who were trying to make out that we were trying to raise this money to aid the Public Works Fund. the first place, it is almost impossible ; secondly, it was not done ; and, thirdly, it was not con- templated. The whole reason why two millions was asked for was to give a strong finance -- a strong capital account -to the Advances to Settlers Department, showing intending bor- rowers and the settlers of the country that it was intended to continue this great boon to Captain RUSSELL. - Because you could not get the two millions. Mr. SEDDON .- Well, there is nothing im- possible, and had it been that the circum- stances at Home would have facilitated my being able to obtain two millions at the end of next year I should, had I so desired, have succeeded in getting it though the House. I know the House, when it is shown to them there is an advantage to finance and to the good of the country that it should be done, would not have been appealed to in vain. But I wish to be straightforward, and in the face of information I received that I was not called upon to disclose-that it was not likely there would be an opportunity for raising the money at an early date, and it would not be to our advantage to have a borrowing-power we could not use-1 voluntarily asked to reduce the amount. Instead of being received as it was, it ought to have been received with pleasure by those who objected to the larger amount, instead of wishing to make out that it was done because of their objections. It does not encourage one to meet members, and I say the treatment I received from some honourable members does not encourage me to repeat the operation. I have done what I believe to be in the best interests of the Advances to Settlers Department. I will conclude by saying that the amount I am asking for is, in my opinion, barely sufficient to meet requirements. Honour- able members will appreciate my difficulties- namely, that I do not wish to borrow money to a large extent at the present high rate of in- terest ; and, not wishing to pay a high rate of interest for our money, we are keeping down the amounts that we are lending. That is what I call business; but when I can get my money at a low rate the amount that we will be lending will be much more than half a million. The Superintendent of the department has been almost like a gigantic steamer lashed to a wharf for some time past. An Hon. MEMBER .- With you straining at the hawser. Mr. SEDDON .- Yes : but the hawser has been manufactured outside this colony, and under circumstances which we could in no way control. The difficulty of obtaining money at a cheap rate of interest in the Mother-country has stopped us from advancing as readily as we otherwise would have done. I was surprised to find myself reported to have said that we could not obtain the money, and that but for th it there would be no restriction. Sir I have had no difficulty in obtaining money, but I had In a sufficient knowledge of business to know that it would not pay to borrow money at 4 per cent. for the purposes of the Advances to Settlers Department. and that to do so would be to pull back the benefits ; for all the calculations had been based upon getting money at not more than 8} per cent. If we depart from that prin- ciple by lending largely at the higher rate the department would be pulled back to the 
<page:596>
extent of the difference, and then all our calculations would be upset. So, while the money was there, it was not considered prudent for us to borrow and lend at high rates. We have therefore refrained from doing so. I repeat that, if securities were going at high rates, people who otherwise would not look at the department would rush it for large amounts ; but the department was not intended for rendering assistance under those circum- stances. There must be a certain amount of large loans, but the masses of the people must be considered. If the money went in large loans, and it was borrowed at 4 per cent., it would be bad business. I have had to bear the brunt of the adverse criticism in connection with this matter, but now that honourable members have had my explanation I am sure they will be sorry. We have kept within our limits, and yet we have helped settlers as far as possible. Owing to the abnormal conditions larger demands have been made upon us. With the high interest we should have had to pay for our money, to have given the advances to this increased amount would have crippled to some extent the department, and we had to refuse-and, I think, properly so-a class of in- vestors. It must not be said a slip was made : but, if it was said, it was only a slip of the tongue, and not by me, and that slip was taken hold of by members opposite. The member for Hawke's Bay tried to father it on to me : that the reason we had not advanced on these applications was that we could not get the money. I never said so, and it was not so. We would have had no difficulty in getting the money. It was not on account of that. It was because we would have to pay a high rate of in- terest, and the applications increased because a    high rate was being demanded by the outside money-lending institutions. The position now of the department is this : So soon as there is an opportunity of obtaining the money at a lower rate of interest, we have a number of appli- cations held over, and if the money market was easy the amount lent will be more than half a million for this or for the next year. I think that was the sum calculated. If we increased the amount, and we have less than $100.000 of loan-money in March next. I say the department would have been crippled if the amendment of the honourable member for Hawke's Bay had been carried. I have put these figures now before the Committee. I have pointed out how erroneous it would have been if members had been misled, and had voted as they were asked to vote by the honour- al le member. In conclusion. I will say this : that the member for Hawke's Bay, and those who opposed this measure persistently and consistently, have come to this conclusion now, as stated by the honourable member for Hawke's Bay himself in Committee. He said he had opposed the Bill ; that it was now la \\ ; and as it was law, although it was there against his wishes, and he does not believe in it to-day, yet he would not be a party to repeal it. I think that is what he said. Very well, he is not friendly disposed ; and, not being friendly dis- Mr. Seddon posed, the less we have where there is a risk, as the honourable member thinks there is a risk - he has that reservation still - the less risk it will feel to me-the less amount I give you the less risk there will be. So he was quite consistent in refusing the amount asked for. I can say nothing more than this : I do believe that, of all the experiments we have tried, this lending to the settlers of the country has been the greatest success. There has been, I may say, no loss whatever. There is at the present time a slight risk. I tell that to honourable members, and I have had to speak plainly some- times. I think the risk is owing to the fact that the values of land at the present time in this colony are very high. An Hon. MEMBER .- Too high. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- The valuations are. Mr. SEDDON .- I tell you the prices that people are paying for the land at the present time, unless our staple products increase in price- Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER. - Your time is up. Mr. SEDDON .- Just as I was about to give you an illustration of this my time is up. Captain RUSSELL (Hawke's Bay) .- I will take up a very few minutes ; nor should I have spoken on this occasion had it not been that, having moved an amendment in Committee. it is right that I should place on record why I did so. The Right Hon. the Premier professes to make a moan in that he cannot pass the original Bill which he introduced. I can under- stand that the honourable gentleman, if he ever indulges in that schoolboy trick of putting his tongue in his check, does so now, and laughs at the House, inasmuch as he has "jockeyed " it once more. He knows well enough that practi cally he has got his original Bill. It is the same Bill that he introduced, slightly meditied. It is perfectly true that in the 2nd clause we have struck out the word "two" and inserted 1 "one," and thereby the House has been led- I will not say the House, but the world -- has been led to suppose that the Right Hon. the Premier has only got half of what he wanted. If honourable members will read the provivo ! in the Bill as introduced they will see that he has got almost exactly what he wanted be- fore. In the Bill originally introduced there is a proviso that only one million of money should be raised in one year. That proviso is now struck out, but the Premier gets the one million this year, and that is all he originally proposed. The Premier is one of those " artful dodgers " who knows exactly what he wants. and generally manages to get it. It has bron very interesting to me to endeavour to follow the Right Hon. the Premier's figures to-night. I am no expert in figures, I admit : but I con- fess I was more puzzled as to what the position of the funds in the Advances to Settlers Account really is when he finished than when he began his speech. We have heard one Minister put i at $760,000 ; from another that it is £620.001; from the honourable member who ought to be in charge of the Bill, but is not .- the Minister in charge of that department, but who, according, 
<page:597>
that it is $590,000 ; the Premier told us that it is $560,000, and the other night he said there were 500,000 liquid pounds available for this Which is right, and which is department. wrong ? Who can tell ? Mr. SEDDON .- All right. Captain RUSSELL .- It may be all right, but certainly I am all wrong when I attempt to understand what it all means. Mr. SEDDON .- Different dates. Captain RUSSELL .- They are all supposed to be balances on the 31st March. That is what made me ask the right honourable gentle- man just now if there were any of these figures antecedent to the 31st March. He replied that they were all available on the Alst March. The Premier charged the honourable member for Patea with change of front on this Bill. do not think there was any occasion to accuse him of change of front. The honourable gentle- man may, in all probability, have said what the right honourable gentleman alleges he did say ; but, like all men when they hear the arguments, they learn what the state of the finance is ; and, having learned that there was a large amount available, and that the House was prepared to allow the Government to borrow a further half a million of money, they are led to suppose that it was all the money necessary to acquire for the whole remainder of the year. Then, I was astonished, too, when the Right Hon. the Premier told us that it was "' a nice cup of tea' for a lending depart- ment to have to depend upon repayments which came in under the Advances to Settlers Act," and that they varied, I think he said, from nothing up to £10,000 a month. Well, all I can say is this : that if the money is lent upon such precarious security that the department cannot make sure that they will get interest repayments at a definite time, the investments must be very bad indeed, which I am glad to say I do not think is the case. The papers in our possession show-I speak from memory that the year before last there was $104,473 ; in 1900, £136,533 ; and in 1901, £155,000, all paid in to the department. Surely that goes to prove that, if the ratio of repayments is to continue in proportion to the new loans, the amount of £175,000 per annum for the next two years is a very moderate computa- tion of the amount which will be repaid, and will be available during the year. 11.30. Whether it is paid in the month of January or February, or whether it even comes in so late as the 31st March, the money which has accrued during the previous year will, if we are to judge by experience, be paid within that year, and therefore that money will be available. Well, then, the reason which caused me to move that amendment was .my firm conviction that there was sufficient money without borrowing a large sum -that there is no necessity for borrowing one million-and that the sum of $500,000 is ample to meet all the demands that can possibly come upon the department during the course of the next year, and after that ; and I arrive at that con- by the Minister in charge of the department, but upon the returns and papers which are laid before Parliament. Here I would say that I was rather astonished to hear the Premier say that he, being Premier, knows the finances of the Advances to Settlers Bill better than his colleague who is in charge of the depart- ment. Mr. SEDDON .- This is a loan Bill, and as Colonial Treasurer I have to raise the money. Captain RUSSELL. - If the honourable gentleman who is in charge of the depart- ment does not understand the finances of the department. I would say that he has no right to hold the portfolio ; and if the department is to be successfully administered the honourable gentleman in charge of it must know the finances of it better than the Premier does now, or it I will inevitably come to grief. However, I take the parliamentary papers which are put into our hands : whether the figures are the same as those quoted by the Minister I do not know, and I do not care ; but it seems to me that any person who wishes to study the finance of the colony ought not to take the spoken words of any Minister, which can easily be wrong, but he ought to examine the authorised returns and tables sent out by the department, and they show that on the 31st March there was ±620,000 available. It is perfectly clear that, as far as we can read the returns, that was so. The re- pay ments for 1902 I estimate at £175,000; and, seeing the increase for previous years has been at that rate, upon the extra amount of money which has been advanced during the past year, and will be advanced during this coming year, it stands to reason that £175,000 is a very mode- rate computation. Then, again, following that up with a loan of £500,000, and a repayment of £175,000 on the following 31st March, 1903- - Mr. SEDDON. - Mr. McGowan says those figures are wrong. Captain RUSSELL. - I disagree with Mr. McGowan, and, as I tate my figures from the papers, I think Mr. McGowan is wrong. The figures he himself puts on the table I take to be his deliberately expressed opinion, and those figures show that there have been repayments from year to year in increasing ratio on the amount of the capital invested under this Act ; and therefore I have every reason to believe that that ratio will continue this year-always supposing, as I do suppose, that the invest- ments have been sound. These figures added together give £1,470,000 which would be avail- able up to the 31st March, 1903 ; and I main- tain that all the money which is likely to be lent during that period will not exceed £600,000 a year, and so will be sufficient until the 31st March, 1903, and leave at that date at least $200,000 in hand to carry on until Parliament meets. Under these circumstances I maintain that it is perfectly right that we should en- deavour to limit the amount. The Premier has tried to explain away the statement he made the other night, in what was unmis- takable language, that magnificent securities have been offered to the department which have 
<page:598>
money which have been at the disposal of the department, and I notice that the Right Hon. the Premier was careful in his words. He said no money had been taken from the Advances to Settlers Department and lent to the Public Works Department, that no such thing was ever contemplated, and no such thing was ever done. But the right honour- able gentleman did not say money had not been lent to any other departments ; and, unless he will specifically and categorically deny that money has been lent from this department and made use of in any other branch of the public service, I shall stick to the opinion I do hold now most strongly-that the money was not available to be lent on those magnificent- that was the word used-securities, because the Government had loaned the money to some other department, and it was not avail- able for the department to which it belonged. I do not know what other inference can be come to. It is absurd to tell me there was $500,000 liquid, as the Premier said in his second - reading speech, and they could not advance money on the magnificent securities offered. Sir, I think that is all I need say on this Bill. Having debated the matter so long in Committee, I feel it is unnecessary now to debate it at any length ; but I feel sure a loan for a million is unnecessary. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton) .- I take it as a compliment that, while the Right Hon. the Premier professed to throw discredit on my ability to discuss financial matters, he devoted  32106019788246 about three-quarters of his entire speech to criti- cism upon the position I have taken up, and the figures I have placed before the House in con- nection with this matter. Sir, we have had a     good many versions of the financial position of this department. The Hon. Captain Russell made one statement with which I disagree. He says that the Premier has obtained his wish, so far as his original proposal was concerned. Now, the original proposal of the Premier was that two millions should be borrowed, and only one million should be raised in the year. That amount is limited to one million, and con- sequently the Premier is only in a position to raise one million. But had the Premier's original proposal been given effect to, as I pointed out on a previous occasion, the Govern- ment could have raised two millions before the House met next year. They could have raised the first million during the currency of the present financial year, and they could have raised the second million directly the present financial year closed ; and therefore, when the House was called together, we might have found that the Government had raised the two millions. Now, Sir, I cannot under- stand how it can be that these gentlemen who occupy the Treasury benches appear to know so little of the finances of the depart- ments they administer. To me it is astonish- ing that, with the Premier as Treasurer, dandling on his knee his political infant-the honourable gentleman who is in charge of this Captain Russell tell the same story for two days in succession. Why, Fir, what was the statement that was made-like the Premier, I am quoting from my notes . by those honourable gentlemen when the Bill was first introduced in the second reading ? The Minister in charge of the Bill said, "The present position is this : There is a balance to be raised under the last statute of $760,000; but there is a sum of $200,000 already pledged against that amount, and the annual working of the office represents in round numbers about $500,000." That was the that honourable gentleman's statement : there were £560,000 available, plus £200.000 that had been already pledged, and that the work of the department required $500,000. In the same debate the Premier said, In reply to an interjection of the member for Bay of Plenty, "Not 'to be raised,' but 9760,000 yet to be raised under the authority of the principal Act, and of this only $560,000 now remains available for investment on mort- gage." Again, the Hon. Mr. Mills interjected, in reply to an honourable member. " I said there were temporary advances against it"; and finally the Premier said, "The amount that was not raised was $760,000. The honourable member will not find that in the accounts at all. The amount, as I say, not raised was 760,000. The amount available on the 31-t March was only $560,000." To-night the Premier comes down with yet another state- ment, and says that the amount unraised was not $560,000, but was $530,000. Am I correct in that ? Mr. SEDDON .- Yes. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- And the honouralie gentleman said that was the position on the 31st March. Mr. SEDDON. - No, I did not. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- That was the state- ment the honourable gentleman made, and the whole argument of the honourable gentleman was on the position as at the 31st March : and vet what do we find? That in the Giaseite published on Tuesday we get £30,000 which bad not been raised on the 31st March at all, but which has been raised since the beginning of the present financial year, and has been bor- rowed, the Premier says, from the Bank of New Zealand on short-dated debentures, and, quite possibly, only a week ago. At any rate, I only mention these facts for the purpose of showing. as I have stated, that the figures of the se honourable gentlemen cannot be depended opon from one day to the following. The Premier now tells us a different statement from what he told us when the Bill was up for its second reading on the 2nd August, and also different from what he said the other night in Commit- tee. I expect he did not even know then about the £30,000; he has ascertained it since. Now. the great argument in favour of the two-million loan was that this department required a strong finance, and the Premier charges me with inconsistency in having said that I should not vote for the two- million loan, but for 
<page:599>
remark I made was, "I shall therefore sup- port any motion that may be framed for the purpose of reducing the amount borrowable under this Bill to the sum of one million." But, if the honourable gentleman has come forward and reduced his proposal by 50 per cent., will he not give me a right to the same privilege? The honourable gentleman came down first with a proposal to borrow two millions, and he cuts that down by 50 per cent. Then, when I looked more carefully into the figures than I had been able to do on the 2nd August, when the proposal was first made, and when I have ascertained, as I have done since, what a critical position the colony is in in the way of borrowing that has been going on, I say that I am not prepared to place in the hands of the Ministry the power to raise so much more money than is absolutely necessary for the purpose of carrying on this department. And now I shall show exactly what the posi- tion at the present time is, and, taking the Premier's own figures, I shall prove that the half-million I voted for would have been ample to carry on the department for the next two years. I say hat, according to the statements both of the Premier and of the Minister in charge of the Bill, there was in hand on the 31st March unraised moneys to the amount of $560,000. Now, in connection with that I assert further that during the current year there will be available for reinvestment no less a sum than $175,000. I arrive at that state- ment in this way : 1 hold in my hand H .- 12, the report of the Public 'Trust Office, and on page 4 of that report I find that the Public Trustee gives a return showing the amounts withdrawn for reinvestment by the Super- intendent under "The Government Advances to Settlers Act. 1894." Now, in the year 1899 there was #171,000 withdrawn by the Superin- tendent from the hands of the Public Trustee for reinvestment. In 1900 there was a sum of $118,000, and in 1901 a sum of #134,000. These sums have been withdrawn by the Su- perintendent of the Advances to Settlers Office from the Public Trustee, and are the moneys paid over under the 1-per-cent. payment, piu. the interest that is received by him ; and, having no object in leaving those moneys in the hands of the Public Trustee, they are withdrawn for reinvestment in mortgages. Now, since that return was prepared large sums have been lent. For instance, during last year the department lent out $539,000 ; and I venture to say, there- fore, that my estimate of £175,000 being avail- able from this fund for reinvestment will prove to be correct. If that is the case, and one adds the #175,000 to the ±560,000, there will be during the current year the sum of £735,000 available for the purposes of the department. Now, if the House had granted to the depart- ment the sum of half a million, that would have given the department during the year ending the 31st March, 1902, the sum of £1,235,000. Let us assume that the proposal of the Treasurer is correct, ard that during the current year he is assume that going to lend a larger sum. Sir, would leave them, at the 1st April of next year, with £635,000 to start that year. During that year they will undoubtedly draw for reinvestment from the Public Trustee at least the same amount as they are likely to draw this year-say, £175,000 again. That would make their total during the year avail- able for purposes of investment as £810,000. If, therefore, they lend during the year ending the 31st March, 1903, the sum of $600,000 on the basis of a half-million loan, they will have on hand on that date #210,000 to carry them on. This short table will set the matter out clearly :- € Available on 1st April, 1901 560,000 To be withdrawn for reinvestment during year 175,000 ... Half-million loan proposed 500,000 £1,235,000 To be lent during year ending 31st 600,000 March, 1902 .. · Available on 1st April, 1902 635,000 To be withdrawn for reinvestment 175,000 during year .. . $810,000 To be lent during year ending 31st 600,000 March, 1903 .. To credit, 1st April, 1903 .. $210,000 Those are my figures, and it will be interest- ing to see how they "pan out" during the year. Mr. SEDDON. - You admit yourself you would have to borrow next session. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- I have not admitted that you will have to borrow, because 1 am of opinion that even during the following year you will have your moneys coming in for reinvestment, and that therefore you could, if necessary, have enough money to carry you on. Of course, this money is to be borrowed under the original Act, and therefore the Go- vernment cannot pay more than 4 per cent. for it ; but, in view of the fact that the Government have already lent $50,000 under the Advances to Settlers Act, which they have borrowed at 4 per cent., it is not desirable that borrowing- powers should be given to the very large extent that the Government proposed in the original Bill. The Premier said that my proposal to raise only half a million in the course of one financial year was intended to harass the Go- vernment. I deny that statement, and say that it is incorrect ; but I also say this : that if the Premier is correct in reducing his original proposal from two millions to one million, surely it was not unreasonable to pro- pose that the borrowing-power in one year should be also lowered to the same extent. Of course, the Premier naturally says he wishes to go on the London market for as large a sum as is possible, at the time most suitable to himself. Well, there may be some- thing in that argument. But what will be the 
<page:600>
obtains a million of money? If he raises a million during this financial year he will have $500,000 more than I have stated ; and what is he to do for an investment of that large sur- plus over the actual necessities of the depart- ment ? Are we to assume that the Treasurer can see his way to find a profitable investment for the surplus money-that he can at a flash find some other profitable investment for it ? If so, that fact indicates that there is some- thing in the contention of the member for Hawke's Bay, myself, and other members, that what the Premier wants this larger amount for is to be able to use it in case the necessities of the colonial finance render easily raised accom- modation necessary. And, when you come to think of the enormous amounts of money that are being spent by the Public Works Department, no doubt the Premier, if he intends to keep up this vast expenditure, is wise from his point of view in getting all the borrowing.powers he possibly can, for I can assure him they will be wanted. When we come to think that during the last week or two the Government of this country, with all the national wealth and credit behind it, has had to borrow money in small sums to keep the pot boiling ; when we know that during the quarter ended the 30th June the public works expendi- ture was £417,000; when we know, as we do know, that there are persons who state that they have unpaid accounts which they are ask- ing to be paid, and that those accounts are being held back from payment for an unreason- able period, then I say that the Treasurer must be, and must have been for some time past, in a position to cause a good many anxious thoughts, even to so courageous a man as the Premier un- doubtedly is. The honourable member possesses     to a remarkable degree the spirit of buoyancy ; he is not depressed for very long. During the last month or so we have seen members of the Government looking very solemn and white both before and after Cabinet meetings, and then we have seen them suddenly assume an airy jaunti- ness and joviality, and we have known that the snag has been got over. But that there have been some snags to be got over there is no doubt, and every one who has come in contact with those honourable gentlemen must have seen that that has been the case. It has been said by the Premier that, unless you had a large sum in hand, public confidence would be shaken in the department. What is the position at the pre- sent time ? On the 31st March the department had less than $30,000 in hand. It is quite true they had unused borrowing-powers. I like to prove my statements as I go along, and I am quoting now from page 4, B .- 13, in which the Superintendent of the Advances to Settlers Department states the liabilities on the 31st March. He there says that the cash in hand in the bank is $29,872; and since then the honourable gentlemen have been able to carry on this department with a small loan of £30,000 ; and yet it is said that the bottom of the whole scheme will fall out unless they have one million at the back of the department. Mr. G. W. Russell £50,000 from the 31st March ? Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- I express no opinion as to what you have lent : I am not in a position to judge that. But when we have got the parliamentary papers before us I am able to estimate their value just as well as the honour- able gentleman. Of course, one unfair position in which a member of the House is placed who criticizes the Government and the administra- tion is this : that, after he makes his remarks, based upon the only possible data we have in the shape of Government returns, then the Government produce some private memoran- dum from the department which they say upsets the position we take up, but as to the accuracy and value of which we cannot judge. To come back to what I was saying when the Premier interrupted me : the figures show the depart- ment had less than $30,000 cash in hand on the 31st March. Since then they borrowed $30,000 from the Bank of New Zealand, as stated by the Premier, and no doubt the bor- rowing process is still going on, and debentures being floated for providing money. These figures bring us up to the 30th June. What is unstated I cannot judge. But I was going to say I differ entirely from the honourable member for Hawke's Bay. He has, as the Premier stated, been on principle opposed to the Bill. I have never been opposed to it ; I always supported the Bill. I have supported it right through, and I support it still. I say the cheapening of the rate of interest has been a great work, and reflects greater credit on the Hon. Sir Joseph Ward, who introduced it, than some other measures, perhaps, that his name is identified with. I believe the operation of the Act has been good, and that it has been properly administered. I am not like the honourabie member for Masterton, who denounced and attacked the Government in connection with their administration of the Act. Let any- body read the Speech he made the other night, and they will find he denounced the department time and again. I have not done that, because I believe they have acted pru- dently, and are, I think, wise in not lending out a very large amount when they have to pay 4 per cent. ; because it must undoubtedly be the case that, if they pay 4 per cent. and are only charging 4}, they cannot keep the finance of the institution in a sound condition. In the course of his address the Premier referred to a statement made the other night by the Minister in charge of the department, that -- I think the statement was this : that the lending had been restricted because the Government did not con- sider the time opportune to raise the capital for the purpose of lending it out, although magnit .- cent securities had been offered them. Mr. SEDDON .- I never said anything ap- proaching that, because it was not so. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- I did not say the honourable gentleman did. My recollection is that the statement was made by the Minister it. charge of the department, and the Right H n. the Treasurer corrected him. I was not attri- buting it to the honourable gentleman. I sup-

ences between the leader of the Ministry and his colleagues. Mr. SEDDON .- I should like to say that I corrected my colleague, who purported to be using my own words. He said I said so; I corrected him, and said I did not. He was under the impression I had said so. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- I was going to say that the Premier possesses a talent that the Minister in charge of the department does not possess. He possesses the art of the Delphic oracle, whose answer could be read both ways : and he is very facile in finding out the second way to read it when trouble is likely to happen. His juniors have not been long enough in the Ministry to have learned that art, but it leads to friction from time to time when the Premier has to put the brake on, as happened in the case of his colleague asking the House to deal charitably in its criticisms of the measure. I think, Sir, that I have clearly stated 12.0. the position that I am taking up. say that there is no necessity for the raising of the one-million loan. I say, had I known as much when the second reading of this Bill was taken as I knew when it was in Committee, I would not have made the statement that I would even be satisfied with reducing the Go- vernment proposal to one million. I believe that the Government require a very tight rein to be kept upon them in connection with their borrowing proposals. I am of the opinion that the colony views with great alarm that this session proposals for borrowing several mil- lions are being brought down by the Govern- ment, and I believe that if we are to maintain our credit upon the London market we should restrict borrowing in every possible way to pre- sent necessities. The danger to this colony is that, while the former Premier, John Ballance, set up a policy of independence of the London market, under the present gigantic policy of borrowing we are forced to go to the London market. The floating of half a million in the colony is not sufficient for us to be able to realise what Mr. Ballance called structural independence in borrowing, and, if these large sums are to be borrowed, the Government will be compelled to go to the English money- lender. If they are compelled to do that, the result will certainly be that we shall become the slaves of the foreign bondholders, and, instead of working for ourselves and our country, we shall be in the position of the rack- rented tenants of Ireland, who, being in their own country, do not own it, and who, by their energy and labour, provide wealth that is being spent by absentee landlords. We have taxes against absentee landlords; but what is the difference between the absentee landlord and the absentee bondholder. Are they not drain ing the very life's blood out of the colony ? I say that, if the Government are going to em- bark upon this large borrowing policy to the extent that they propose, the outcome of it must be that they will not be able to get these vast sums in the colony. Far better to restrict your borrowing to the smallest amount con- and, having done that, consent to float your loans as far as possible in New Zealand. If I thought there was any question as to the stability of the Advances to Settlers Depart- \- ment, I would stand shoulder to shoulder with the Government in their efforts to borrow any amount required. But I am sure that a half-milllion will be enough to carry on during this financial year and the next. Having that opinion, I was justified in voting for a half- million loan only, instead of the million asked for by the Government. Mr. HASELDEN (Patea). - Sir, it is not necessary for me to say much after what has fallen from the honourable member for Riccar- ton. The Premier led us to understand, in moving the second reading of this Bill, that the amount asked for was really required, and I be- lieved, in consequence, that there was very little money left in the Advances to Settlers Office. As a matter of fact, the right honourable gentle- man told a deputation from the West Coast that I there was very little money in the Treasury of the colony at all, and that statement was pub- lished in the newspapers. That being so, I thought that a great hardship would be inflicted on the settlers of the country if the Advances to Settlers Office stopped lending the money. Instead of the office having no money, how- ever, I now find that there is sufficient not only for the purposes of the next twelve months, but for at least a year and a half -that there is a sum of $500,000 or $760,000 available to lend to the settlers. When I found that was so I began to change my opinion I will admit ; and not only that, but when the Premier asked in the first instance for two millions, and subsequently came down and said he would reduce it to one million. I began to doubt what he would have done with the two millions if he had borrowed it. I concluded that it would not have been lent to the settlers, but that it would have been used for some other purposes. Therefore I opposed the one-million proposal, and supported the amendment to have it cut down to $500,000. Now, Sir, I am not much in love with this Advances to Settlers Office. The Premier has stated to-night that the price of land is too high. That I perfectly agree with ; but it is not made high by the rates ob- tained for its produce. What has put up the price of land ? It is the low rate of interest at which money can be borrowed. I do not say for one moment that we should not pay a low rate of interest ; but the people who under ordinary circumstances would not give more than #10 an acre for land rush in for land at $20 an acre, because they can get the money at half the rate of interest. That is the reason why land has gone up. And that is the trouble, and will be the trouble for many years to come, I fear. Now, not only did I find that although two millions were asked for only one million was required ; but, what is more, there is a large sum of $200,000 that nobody can give an account of. The Premier himself only laughed and chaffed members when he was asked to explain it. He would give us 
<page:602>
should be fair, square, and above-board, it is the accounts of the Advances to Settlers Office. But we have got no information what became of this #200,000, and, just the same, I believe we would get no information about the two millions if it was borrowed. There- fore I think I was perfectly justified in voting against the larger sum being borrowed. I think the sooner this particular office is removed alto- gether from political control the better, because at the present time the feeling all over the country is that if a man is of the right " colour " he gets an advance, and if he happens to be of the wrong " colour " he gets nothing at all. Mr. MILLS (Minister in charge of the Ad- vances to Settlers Office). - Sir 1 am rather surprised to hear my young political friend re- iterate the foolish charge that he made the other night in reference to right "colour" being mixed up in this department. I was very much astonished when, to verify his state- ment, he produced a letter and read it to this House, and although he promised to hand it over to me, and furnish the name of the writer, I have never seen it yet. Evidently the honourable member thought better of it, and considered perhaps it would be wiser not to pass that letter on to me. However, I took down some of the particulars given to me, and, knowing it was casting a reflection on the office itself, I have taken the trouble to look into them, and find out how much truth there is in the statement made by my honourable friend. Now. let me tell him that it is quite true that a certain party-I will not mention his name -applied for a loan ; and after he had made his application the loan was granted. The mortgage was actually executed, but, would you believe it, when they came to search the Deeds Ofhce they actually found that this friend of the honourable member for Patea, who had sent in his application to the office to borrow this money, had never disclosed that he had a second mortgage over this property. He never even showed it in the application he made. He made a statement which was false, and, if under the Justices of the Peace Act, would have run him quickly in to a certain place I will not name. And, I suppose, this is the man who the honourable member says was refused a loan because he was not of the right "colour." Well, we must all acknowledge that he was not of the right "colour " in another sense, for his " colour was very bad, there can be no doubt about that, and I do not wonder that the Board looked very askance, and will do for a long time to come, at any other ap- plication coming from that particular appli- cant. When they discovered this fact, which had been concealed, he was immediately told that he could not get this advance unless he released his second mortgage. This he was unable to do, and. the property not being worth sufficient to advance enough to release both mortgages, the consequence was that the Board suffered a lot of gratuitous humbugging, to use no stronger term, from this particular applicant. Mr. Haselden aspiring politician, can be forgiven for accept- ing a letter from anybody or nobody, and coming to this House and making the statement he did the other evening, and which he reiterated this evening, because he lacks exi erience. Mr. HASELDEN .- There was nothing about the mortgage in the letter : but I am quite pre- pared to accept the Hon. the Minister's statement. . Mr. MILLS .- All I would say is this: that it would be advisable for my honourable friend to look more carefully into matters of a similar kind, and be very sure of his evidence before he makes such a charge against any department of the Government in this House. I am quite satisfied that before he has been in Parliament two sessions he will begin to realise what the re- sponsibility of his position means far better than he does at present. Well, Sir, he says also that he has been in a financial fog about $200,000. I do not wonder at my honoural le friend being in a mist, because the honourable member for Riccarton, who prides himself on being a finan- cial authority, has been in a thicker fog and mist over the balance-sheet all the time, and he has evidently conveyed some of the misty feel- ing to the honourable member for Patea. I am sorry that the honourable member for Riccarton is not in his place; but in the meantime, and until he puts in an appearance, I will say a few words with regard to a statement made by Captain Russell, the member for Hawke's Bay. His was very mild criticism, but in his speech on the second reading he said that this money was being raised for " ulterior purposes." Now, an expression of that kind against the Government is not a pleasant one, especially when there is no truth in it. From that he went on to assume that there would be no more money required for making advances by this office beyond the $500,000 in one year. A much larger which is quite erroneous. sum will be required, as the Premier has ex- plained to-night, for no one can say what will be the amount advanced during the current year if you have the money to advance. It is simply a question of ways and means ; but if the House limits the department to $500.000 per annum it would simply be impossible for them to lend out more than they had at their disposal. Every good business-man know that. Therefore, when the honourable member for Hawke's Bay made that statement he was working on the assumption that no larger sum would be required. He also said be had a conviction there was sufficient with- out any further loan to carry on with until next year. Well, I do not find fault with the honouralle member for that, because every one is entitled to have an opinion and hold convictions, and we can agree to differ. But I would point out to the honouratle member that he has not got the responsibility of working the department, and I have : so. naturally, I prefer to abide by the advice of the Superintendent, who has the charge of the office and the departmental work, and knows what he is talking about. Now I come to 
<page:603>
other night with a very high jump in financial matters ; but he did not clear the hurdle, and ; marks by saying that if what the member for came down like a load of bricks,-what they call "a cropper." He stated that he had discovered a flaw in the last balance-sheet, and that the £200,000 was actually required for another purpose for which the Premier had taken it. Now, has the honourable gentleman supported that bald statement in any way in this House? No. He makes these rash asser- tions without reflection, and spreads them broadcast throughout the colony without caring a rap what evil they may do. And then he stands up in this House and tells us he is in favour of assisting and maintaining the Advances to Settlers Office. Well may the settlers exclaim, "Save me from my friends." I have kno n the honourable gentleman some years no ., but I have never known him since the first time he came into the House stick to his professions or to one straight path very long. First he gains entrance into the House professing one line of policy and support to the Liberal party ; then he is in veiled rebellion the next session ; and he is in open rebellion the third, but doing no good by his criticism, and is left out in the cold at the next election Mr. SEDDON. And then he gets a spell. Mr. MILLS .- Yes, and that may come again very soon ; but, at any rate, that is the position. And yet the honourable gentleman assumes to lecture men who have been in the House so long, and borne the heat and burden of the day for so many years consecutively, and ought to  know something of what they are talking about. An Hon. MEMBER .- You ought to. Mr MILLS .-- Exactly, and I profess to do so. At any rate, I am quite satisfied that the member for Riccarton cannot teach me any- thing in respect to these or any other figures. Mr. HERRIES. - The Premier does not think so. Mr. MILLS .- Yes, the Premier does. The only difference was as I explained the other night. I was informed by the head of the department that $760,000 was the balance of the loan we were empowered to raise, and the Premier has given the same figures to-night ; but the head of the department said there was about $200,000 advanced against it. I tell the House to-night, as I told members the other dav, that the $200,000 was not all a liability as at the 31st March. I was addressing the House in August, nearly five months later, and speak- ing generally when the matter was brought up on the second reading. The same figures that were quoted by the Right Hon. the Premier to- night were quoted by me then, with regard to the sum that was actually the true balance, but not on the 31st March. Then, I took down the figures the member for Riccarton gave, and I | honourable gentleman should study and learn was referring to them when I was speaking. He has given the same figures again to-night, and I was rather astonished that the senior member for Christchurch City (Mr. Collins) should twit the Premier and myself with not having the correct figures, when I was simply | he came to this House. I will not quote the ¡ the member for Riccarton. I prefaced my re- Riccarton said was correct, and we did not borrow any more money, there could then be only about $235,000 at the end of March, 1902, and that calculation only left the bare sum of $500,000 to advance on mort- gages -- nothing for expenses in raising the loan, nothing for the Assurance Fund, and nothing for departmental expenses. I did not give my own figures at all at that time; but the member for Christchurch City seems to have thought it was so. However, he fairly acknowledged to me he was wrong on my show- ing him the figures as I took them down ; and therefore I sav now, and I say it emphati- cally, that the figures given by the member for Riccarton are simply misleading- he misled himself and tried to mislead this House; and if the honourable member makes such egregious miscalculation for only one year, where will he get to over a longer period, and I must certainly decline to pay any attention to them. We must make provision for a twelve- month in advance. Never once in his speech did the honourable gentleman allude to the cost of raising this money, or the Assurance Fund which has to be provided, and the departmental expenses ; he said nothing about them, as if they meant nothing. The honourable gentle- man left all these important items out, and then asks Parliament to accept his statement of accounts in preference to the audited balance- sheet as certified to by the Auditor-General. Can anything be more absurd ! An Hon. MEMBER .- How much ; is it not under $30,000 ? Mr. MILLS .- No : the amount for each of these items is considerable, and will mean a large sum in the aggregate, thus reducing the balance considerably at the 31st March, 1902 ; and we must allow a reasonable time for raising the new loan ; therefore I think those members who profess to know all about these financial matters should, at any rate, have given the figures to the House and shown they were dealing with a fair balance-sheet and quoting from both sides properly. Well, Sir, the honourable member for Riccarton then twitted us with being inconsistent. Well, I think it comes with very bad grace from the honourable member for Riccarton to rise in this House and charge any other honourable member with inconsistency. Why, the very name of the electorate that he represents has somehow got converted into a new term. simply because those who know him best think he would represent " Rickety " much better than Riccarton. And to hear him speak about consistency : why, we might as well expect to hear something about loyalty from him very soon ! I think the his lesson better, and not come here and lecture this House about consistency or anything of that kind until he has proved himself capable of faithfully representing and carrying out the professions he made to his constituents before 
<page:604>
church, because honourable gentlemen are as familiar with it as I am ; but if the honourable gentleman will throw harsh terms across the floor of this House it is simply a matter of necessity to contradict him. Then, Sir, he went on to say that the Government had met with some snags lately which were difficult to get over, and he said that, watching the faces of the members of the Government, he noticed them go pale and red by turns. Well, I am sorry to say I think the honourable gentleman has got past that stage : I do not think he could blush ; but at the same time I believe there are a few political snags in this House, and the honour- able gentleman represents them very well. These are the only snags which trouble us, and it will not be for very long. The honour- able gentleman finally concluded by saying he supported the Bill. Well, if any one reading the speech of the honourable gentleman can say that it conveys consistent support of the advances - to- settlers policy I shall be more than astounded, because everything the honourable gentleman said has been practically against the measure and the office, or other- wise trying to kill the Bill with kindness. The honourable gentleman could do nothing but try and pull the Bill and balance-sheet to pieces, but without success. Then, to crown all, he wound up by saying he was always in favour of giving these advances to settlers. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL. - Sir, I wish to make a personal explanation. The honourable gentle- man is misquoting me. Mr. MILLS .- I he honourable gentleman can explain when I have finished. If that is the kind of assistance the honourable gentleman gives to policy measures of the Government he was elected to support, I am quite satisfied those who are true members of the Liberal party are far better without him. That is unquestion- able ; and therefore he and I will agree to differ in opinion ; but I should like to see in future a little more consistency on the part of the honourable member, and I hope that his future actions will confirm us in the belief that he has seen the error of his ways and intends after this to be more " consistent." Mr. LAURENSON (Lyttelton). - I have heard it said that if a man has got nothing to say he will take his full half-hour to say it ; that if he had perhaps something worth saying he will say it in twenty minutes ; but that if he has something that he has thought over and boiled down, so that it is really worth listening to, he can say it in five minutes. Well, I intend to endeavour to be one of the latter. We have heard a great deal of argument against sup- porting this Bill, and have had masses of figures put before us. We have been told of $500,000, and of $760,000, and of accrued interest and sinking fund $175,000 for two years, and of $500,000 borrowed, and so on-all to prove that there is no need for more than half a million of money to be granted to the Government to carry on the Advances to Settlers Office. Now, putting all these things on one side, what are the facts of the case? Some seven years ago Mr. Mills determined to advance money to settlers under a special Act passed for that purpose, and to take power to borrow $3,000,000 to enable them to carry on the functions of that office. That Act has now been in force something over six years, and during the last year the sum advanced amounted to between $500,000 and £600,000, and the applications are steadily increasing. and the Government now come to us and say, " We want power to borrow another million pounds." It is admitted, according to the Government's own statement, that on the 31st March they had $760,000 in hand, and now they ask power to borrow one million ; and they assure us that they will not put the loan on the London market until an opportune time arises. Now, if they are not to be trusted with that discre- tionary power they are not fit to sit on those benches, and so I can understand the attitude taken up by our friends of the Opposition, who say they will not allow more than half a mil- lion ; but, honestly, I do not understand the attitude taken up by so-called Government sup- porters such as the honourable member for Riccarton, who say they will not give power to borrow more than half a million. The Premier was very severe upon the honourable member for Riccarton, and the honourable member, in reply, called the Premier a "buoyant " man. Now, I do not know what he means by a "buoyant " man, but I think the honourable member for Riccarton might be best described by saying that he is an ambidextrous poli It is tician. We know what that means. a man who can use his right and his left hand with equal facility, and sometimes we really do not know which hand the honour- able member for Riccarton is using. Now. as far as the present question is concerned. I am going to support the Government's appli- cation to get another million pounds. The honourable member for Riccarton delivered a speech on the second reading of this Bill, and I could not help being struck with the emphatic force with which he said that the Government should get an assured finance, that an assured finance required a million ; and now, though he has seen no fresh figures, he comes and says that he will only grant them half a million. I cannot see the reason for such a lightning change. As far as I am concerned, I am going to vote for the whole million, because I believe the Government require it at this time. I can, however, hardly help saying that I think it is time we began to realise that the time has come when we should borrow money not outside but within our own borders. The honourable mem- ber for Hawke's Bay made a remark the other night that made me look up some facts and figures. He said it would be almost worth while to find out how much we have spent in the way of paying interest during the past quarter of a cen- tury. I have looked up the blue books for 12.30. the last twenty-six years, and I find we have paid in that time $40,238,701 : or, in other words, if we add to that sum interest and com- pound interest, we would have an amount equal to the whole of our national debt, with some 
<page:605>
fact stares us in the face, and when we also have the encouraging fact that the banks of the colony have now lying at credit and at fixed deposit a sum of seventeen millions sterling, and that the Post-Office Savings-Bank has deposits of over six millions sterling, many of the sums bringing in not more than 2 per cent., I think we might with reason expect to raise money within our own borders in a very simple way indeed. The Government could easily take on themselves the duty and the re- sponsibility of issuing State notes. I know with what a howl of derision this proposal will be received by the average Conservative. The old story of the printing-press and the bale of paper will be thrown at us again ; but, Sir, this will not do away with the fact that the proposal would be a success, by which money would be saved to the country. We would on future moneys raised save the interest we have now to pay annually - interest that is increasing from year to year. Sir, at present there are notes to the value of $1,400,000 cir- culating throughout New Zealand, and I believe the Government could easily have at least two million notes in circulation. We could have behind that circulation a gold reserve equal to one-sixth of that note issue ; and if we did this we would have our loans issued on a gold reserve, which some people insist so strongly on. But, Sir, I think we would not require the gold reserve. All we would require would be to have the State behind our note issue. These notes  would be legal tender for paying our taxes, Customs duty, and for paying all the Government charges we are paying every week ; and with such prospects I ask if it is not time the Government     cast about them and realised that. instead of going to the London market. hat in hand, to borrow money, we should raise it within our own borders in a more rational manner than we have hitherto been doing. At one time New Zealand was a country that was undeveloped and struggling, but every year the wealth of the population is increasing in an extraordinary degree, and, that being the position, it is surely not unreasonable that we should begin to press on the Government the necessity of facing the advisability of raising our loans by note issue, and also by raising them, with the Government State security behind them. from our own people. I do not wish to say any more on the subject. Members have already listened to a number of speeches of half-an-hour's duration- speeches the thought in which could have been easily expressed in five minutes ; and, that being so. I will not at this late, or, rather, early hour further detain the House. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) .- Sir, the last speaker commenced his remarks by saying he intended to support the Bill : but I think nearly the whole of his arguments were against it. He said he was opposed to borrowing ; at all events, that he was opposed to going on the London market for money, and that is exactly what is proposed in this Bill. The measure we are now considering gives the Colonial Treasurer authority to go on the London market for a loan of | The Treasurer has made it known that he will a million. In one respect I propose to imitate the honourable member. I know that honour- able members are tired, and I do not wish to keep the House long. We have had a great many sets of figures submitted to the House in connection with the Bill. One set was sub- mitted by the Colonial Treasurer, another by the Minister in charge of the department, an- other by the department itself, and still an- other by the Minister for Railways, who spoke the other night in Committee. At any rate, I think we got the right set of figures to night from the Colonial Treasurer. He commenced his speech by admitting that on the 31st March last the Advances to Settlers Department had $760,000 in the way of unraised capital ; but against that there were issued by way of short-dated debentures £140,000, thus leaving £620,000. Then, again, on short-dated de- bentures there was issued $90,000 against the ¥620,000, leaving £530,000 on the 31st March. That was the position as stated by the Trea- surer. We have been lending money at the rate of something like $500,000 per annumn. Last year the amount advanced was $539 .: 30. Supposing that next year we require for lending purposes $550,000, which is more than we have ever required in one year -we had in repayments last year $155,000. Suppose that next year we have in repayments #150,000 : we deduct that $150,000 from the $550,000, and the net amount required for the current year will be $400,000. The Treasurer admitted that the amount on the 31st March last was £530,000, so that, according to my estimate-and I believe I am correct, because I followed the Treasurer's figures care- fully -- there will be in the possession of the department on the 31st March. 1962. $130,000. That will be the position. Yet the Premier comes down to the House and tells us that he wants a million of money. It seems to me that the Treasurer is a sort of political Oliver Twist - the more we give him the more he wants. Now, I will leave figures. I do not believe in the system under which advances are at present made to settlers, but under the circumstances I am willing to sup- port a Bill to borrow half a million of money for the purpose of the Advances to Settlers Department. In saying that, I may repeat what I said in Committee on the bill : I think that, instead of going to London to borrow money to re-lend to settlers, we should make available the money we have in the lending departments of the Government -- that is to say, that arrangements should be made by which the moneys of the Post-Office Savings-Bank, the Public Trust Department, and the Govern- mont Insurance Department should be advanced to settlers directly or indirectly at a fair rate of interest, instead of going outside the colony to borrow. I am sure that would be better both for depositors in the Post-Office Savings-Bank, and also for those who require borrowed capital. It is quite evident to me that if the Government continue to pursue the present system the effect will be to make money dearer, because they are mopping up all the money available.

Vernment ; so that the Treasurer is already : allow themselves to be in the position of having coming into competition with those who want to borrow as well as with those who want to lend money; and the latter most unfairly, because the money that comes from England does not pay the mortgage-tax, whereas such money belonging to the people in the colony does pay that tax. Just one other point. I have been given to understand that a division is going to be called for by the Premier through his Whips. Of course, he is within his rights in doing so, but I consider such tactics are most contemptible; and I want to take this opportunity of telling Ministers, as I have told their Whips, that when the Government Whips are put up to call for a division the " pairs" of Opposition members will be considered off. I do not intend to allow Opposition members who happen to be absent, and have given " pairs " in good faith, to be placed in a false position by such tactics as I refer to. Personally, my posi- tion is this : As I said before, I am quite willing to support a Bill to enable the Government to borrow half a million for the purposes of this department, but in taking authority to borrow a million I think they are taxing too much. They are exhausting the credit of the colony, and serving no good purpose. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) .- I think one of the last remarks made by the  honourable member should be noted. I have never heard since I have been a member of this House a gentleman occupying the position of a Whip make a statement to the effect that because of a division being called for on an im- portant measure he has the right to cancel the "pairs " of members who have made them. Those for whom he professes to speak form only one side of the contract. He has no more right to say he is going to cancel " pairs," without consulting the members on this side of the House who have given their " pairs," than he would have the right to make a " pair" between honourable members whom he had never consulted. The honourable member knows this measure has been determinedly op- posed, so far as the amount to be borrowed is concerned, in Committee, and opposed very strongly by himself and other members ; and, under these circumstances, members who enter- tain strong feelings on the matter in the other direction surely have a right to call for a divi sion, if they think proper, so that they and their friends should place their votes on record. Yet. in the face of that, the honourable gentle- man states he is in a position to cancel the "pairs " of those who had given them without anticipating any such autocratic action. Mr. MASSEY .-- I gave notice weeks ago. Sir J. G. WARD .- Even if the honourable gentleman gave notice, as he says, it is surely a very undesirable thing nay, indeed, an unpre- cedented o 10-to attempt to introduce into the matter of " pairs " such a course - a representa- Mr. Massey ment of that kind without those on this side who are away being consulted. If this sort of House should not give "pairs " at all. but their votes put on record or not as they think fit. I rose more especially for the purpose of placing on record my dissent from one or two observations not only of the last speaker, but of some honourable members who preceded him. They have mostly been exercised about the proposal to raise a million, and all have put a hypothetical case that at a certain date the amount to be lent by the Office of the Advances to Settlers will be so-much. The last speaker made the amount $400,000. On what does he base his calculation by which he arrives at that amount ? It is, of course, mere assumption. If we turn to the report of the department we shall find that the loans applied for in excess of those issued by the office amount to no less a sum than $1,300,000 ; that is, the amount of loans applied for in excess of the amount lent by the office. Does this not clearly show that the demands of borrowers made on the Why, then, do they ask office are very great ? for the amount to be limited to $500,000? The only reason can be to cripple the office, and thus they would injure the settlers. Now, if such a proposal as that of the last speaker, and one or two others, were given effect to- namely, for the transference of money from Government institutions such as the Government Insurance, the Public Trust Office, and the Post-Office Savings-Bank to the Advances to Settlers Department-what would it do? It would withdraw from competition in the country very large sums, which the farmers and others require to enable them to get the money necessary for them to carry on their business. It must be very well known that both the Government Insurance and Public Trust Departments lend large sums beyond the limit of the Advances to Settlers Office. The honourable gentleman would, if he had his way, come down with a proposal that the Government should abstain from borrowing - I understood him to say - any money in the London market at all for the Department of the Advances to Settlers, and to utilise the money of the Public Trust Office and the Go- vernment Insurance. The honourable member must know, if he has any knowledge of what is going on in this colony, that hundreds - ave. thousands-have been dependent on the Govern- mont Insurance Othce and the Public Trust Office for money to enable them to obtain mort- gages, and so carry on their ordinary affairs. The Post Office invests its money very largely with the Treasury in Government debentures. and the honourable gentleman knows perfectly well that indirectly it is a means of assisting the people of this country, by advances from the Treasury to local government bodies, for in- stance. The Post Office does not lend on mort- gage, but I say that indirectly it greatly assists to have a sufficiency of money for local uses available. Notwithstanding this, he would have us give up what has been a practice for the 
<page:607>
ments have been utilising their funds in lend- ing to borrowers, but the honourable member for Franklin would now have us stop the prac- tice, and do a deal of injury, and allow private institutions to have the whole field of mort- gaging large sums of money in their own hands. And, indirectly, he would also cripple the Advances to Settlers Department by giving it too little money. Sir, it is all very well for the honourable member and others to advocate borrowing large sums of money in the colony. To a certain extent I agree with him that it would be quite right to obtain some of the money required for the colony's requirements ; but if you go for the whole of the loans in this way what would be the result? You would bring about a financial crisis before you knew where you were, by creating a shortage in money for the ordinary industrial, agricultural, and commercial purposes. It appears to me that that is what some honourable members would like to see happen. One honourable member said that during the last twenty-six years this colony had paid away £40,000,000 in interest ; but if we take the ordinary revenue of the country for the last twenty-six years at an average of, say, two and a half millions per annum-I have not had time to look the matter up since he made the statement, but I do not think it is an overestimate-it would amount to a sum of $65,000,000 during the period mentioned, to say nothing of the enormous values that the expenditure of the money  borrowed has given to both private and public properties. Sir, I would ask what would this colony be now, if during that time outside money had not been obtained - if money had not been got to make railways, roads, telegraphs, and other public works ? Honourable members would have found the colony now in the posi- tion of a sheep-walk-probably one or two in the North and South Islands-with a few people dotted here and there, and sheep and cattle taking the place of human beings. It seems to me that by their actions, even at this en- lightened period, some honourable members would desire this. Such are the deductions from the arguments placed before us in this the twentieth century. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- It was the honour- able member for Lyttelton who made the statement. Sir J. G. WARD .- I do not care who it was. I am dealing with principles, not with indi- viduals. Take the case of Great Britain itself. Where would that great Power have been if it had not borrowed its hundreds of millions of money for the internal and external develop- ment of the Empire? Where would the British navy be-our first line of defence? Where would her colonising policy be? Where would the additions to her immense territory, which have added such enormous strength to her dominions, be? Without borrowing, I say, much of this greatness and prestige would not be hers? I do not believe, myself, that we should borrow more money than is absolutely necessary. I am convinced that | this course, have an excess of money in the powerful nation. Notwithstanding the fact that at the present time it has, comparatively speaking, only a handful of people, yet it has the capacity for carrying a population not far below that of Great Britain itself, and as time goes on and our population necessarily in- creases we shall find that the rate per head of taxation will fall. Mr. MASSEY .- It is going up at present. Sir J. G. WARD .- But the colony is not going to retrogress. I say, Sir, if the whole of our moneys for public requirements were bor- rowed in the colony itself ruin would be brought upon many of its industries. We should borrow locally what we can, and gradually, as money increases, we can doubtless do so more and more, but in this matter we have to be careful. If you ask why it is that the Advances to Settlers Department is going for a million of money at the moment, you have the explanation of the Colonial Treasurer. He has told you that it would not be worth while going on the London market for less than a million of money. Mr. MASSEY .- What about the half-million already floated ? Sir J. G. WARD .- That was at 4 per cent. for a short-dated loan ; but honourable members know perfectly well that we are not going to borrow this at 4 per cent. Our settlers require cheap money, and the advances-to-settlers loans should be obtained at 3 per cent. Owing to the prevailing circumstances in South Africa the price of money has temporarily been increased, but that will not last, and I say that the credit of our colony is so good that we are not going to allow the financial institutions of England, or of the colony itself, to extract from us over 1 per cent. more than we are entitled to pay. An Hon. MEMBER. - Why did you not say so ? Sir J. G. WARD .- Because I assumed that the honourable member's intelligence should have made apparent to him, what has been evident to nearly every one else-namely, that there are exceptional circumstances which have caused the rise in the value of money, and which have entailed the greatest difficulty, not only in our colony but all the colonies, of borrowing at low rates in England, and that difficulty is intensified by the fact that no one is able to foresee how much money may still be required for the South African war. When money was required to the extent of $150,000,000 alone by the English Exchequer in connection with the prosecution of the war in South Africa, and to sustain and consolidate the Empire of which we are all very proud to know that we are one of the great component parts; and when I say that members know these extraordinary circumstances exist now, and which were responsible for the rate of interest being 4 per cent., yet they would, according to their statements, have us go on borrowing millions of money at 4 per cent. in the colony, and this too in spite of the fact that hen the normal condition of affairs arrives money will be procurable at 3 per cent. on the London market, and you would, by adopting 
<page:608>
of industry in New Zealand. Now, the last speaker, in the carefully prepared statement which he built up, has practically told us that because it was the intention of the Govern- ment and the members who supported them in obtaining sufficient money to carry on the affairs of the Advances to Settlers Department in a way the responsible people believe to be essential, and because of the intention to go to a division on this question, the honourable member has declared publicly in this House that he was going to take the responsibility of cancelling the whole of the "pairs" entered into by members on both sides of the House who are now absent. He has no right to do that, so far as the members on this side are con. cerned. That clearly shows this: that, having built up on his own assumption that $400,000 is sufficient, he is evidently afraid to put his friends' votes on record as supporting such an outrageous proposal, and he therefore elects to cancel their " pairs." He has made the unreli- able assertion that only $400,000 will be re- quired. He would divert hundreds of thousands of pounds of the two other lending depart- ments of the State- the Government Insurance and Public Trust Departments - from the purposes for which they have always been used, and prevent thousands of people in this country from obtaining the money they re- quired by way of mortgage. He desires to play into the hands of the large private lending insti- tutions as against the State institutions, which they do not like ; and these State institutions  must tend to keep down the rate of interest in this country, and thus add very materially to the welfare of the people of New Zealand. particularly those who require to use borrowed money, and this will in a progressive country always be the case. The Advances to Settlers Department was originally decried, and it was freely stated that it was bound to lead to dis- aster. What has been the experience ? Not one pound has been lost by the Advances to Settlers Office of the millions that have been advanced during the last six years. Now, if that department had lost $50,000, or $100,000, or $500,000, one could have understood those honourable members who are so anxious to restrict the Government in procuring sums of money to enable that institution to carry on its good work. But it has not lost one pound, and yet these honourable members are fully prepared, according to the last speaker, to cut the whole of the money of the Advances to Settlers Department down to $400,000; and, in the statement the honourable member has just made, he said that if it goes to a division, and the votes are put on record, he is prepared to go to the extreme, on his own accord, of cancelling the "pairs " that have been entered into by members who are anxious to vote with the Government on this Bill. The ob- ject of " pairs " is to have the votes on both sides on any measure put on record. Some honour- able members, apparently, if they were here, would, judging by the member for Franklin's attitude, vote with that honourable member. Sir J. G. Ward must be afraid to put them in the position which he takes up himself. But I will not allow him to place absent members who favour the proposals in a false position without direct- ing attention to it. If honourable members pair on a particular measure, their "pairs " ought to be recorded as they paired. No member of the House has the right to put mem- bers in the position of not having their " pairs " recorded. It appears to me that this is a new and most dangerous development in this re- spect. It will create a complete want of confi- dence as between members. Mr. MASSEY. - There will be no more " pairs," then, this session. Sir J. G. WARD .- Very well ; members on this side of the House can do as well without "pairs " as honourable members on that side of the House can. The time has long since gone by for the holding-out of these threats that if one will not do a certain thing, then the other will not do something else. We want to main- tain our positions as sensible men dealing with practical affairs, and we do not want to indulge in conduct that will carry us back to the happy days of boyhood, when perhaps occasionally we were in the habit of telling one another, " If you do not do a particular thing I will not do something else." The time has gone by for such exhibitions of childishness, and especially in such a Chamber as this. I only wish to say this : that all through its existence, for some reason a very strong position has been taken up against this advances-to-settlers system by some members of this House. When it was originally introduced by me into the House it was most bitterly opposed, and fought against for weeks and weeks, and, everything else failing, there was then a determined attempt made to restrict the amount of money. There was also an effort made to reduce the maximum amount of each loan to settlers to such an extent as would, had they succeeded, have brought about disaster to the department. They were not, I am happy to say, successful. And now history is repeating itself : you find that there is still that desire to cripple the institution by trying to keep down the wherewithal for the settlers of New Zealand who require the money. They would thus destroy the power, and prestige, and influence of the office to keep down the excessive rate that other individuals and corporations in com- petition with the office would gladly put on. They know the Advances to Settlers Office is the greatest check upon the increasing of in- terest rates that exists in the colony. In face of the advice of the Government, upon whom the responsibility rests in this matter, who say that it would be ruinous, if not disastrous, to the department during the next twelve months if less than a certain sum was granted. von will get some honourable members to say that? $400,000 is enough, another that we ought to. use the #155,000 accretions, another that you may expect to receive repayments next vear of $176,000. One says you have already got $700,000, another says you have got £835.000 
<page:609>
and another a million of money ; but they all want to tie the Government to not more than £500,000. What does it all come to ? An Hon. MEMBER .- What do you say ? Sir J. G. WARD .- I say that the responsi- bility is with the Government, and, if the Government make a mistake in asking for a lower sum than a million of money for this office, in the course of time it will be judged by what they are doing, and those who have no re- sponsibility, and urge that we should get too little money, would be the very first to condemn us. If this money is to be obtained at 3 per cent., we will only be able to do it by placing the money on the London market when the proper time arrives. There seems to be an attempt to make the Government give more than 4 per cent. for the money, and this is another way of crippling the office, and to do this they would do a serious injury to the settlers of the country. I rose only in consequence of some observations I heard in the course of this debate from the last speaker. I felt grieved to find that there were members willing to do in- jury to the settlers of the country by crippling an institution which has added materially to their prospects, welfare, and happiness, and which will continue to do so, despite the op- position of those honourable members who have done their best to destroy or cripple this most valuable institution. Mr. STEVENS (Manawatu) .-- I rise 1.0. to make a personal explanation. The  member for Franklin has stated here that he intended to cancel the "pairs " recorded with respect to this question. I wish to say that during the time I have occupied the position of Whip I have worked most amicably with that honourable gentleman, and have found him courteous and considerate in every respect, but I deny emphatically that any suggestion or proposition of any kind was made by him for the cancellation of any "pairs." I have re- ceived no such intimation, nor has my co- Whip. Mr. MASSEY .- Yes; the other Whip, Mr. Carncross. Mr. STEVENS .- I think that when a " pair " has been recorded it should be retained, and not cancelled without the express consent of both parties concerned. I would not undertake to break the "pairs " of any members, and it has been a surprise to me, this statement of the honourable member for Franklin that he in- tended to cancel the "pairs." I regret it very much, and hope that he may reconsider bis determination. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) .- On this question of "pairs " you, Sir, will remember that on the occasion of the Address in Reply the Premier did something that nobody expected and that had probably never been done in this House since the foundation of the colony. He called for a division on the Address in Reply on the question that a respectful Address be presented to His Excellency. I said at the time that it was a most unusual thing to do, and I objected to any "pairs " being recorded. I told Mr. Carncross, who was the Acting-Whip at the VOL. CXVII .- 38. time, that on any future occasion when a division was called for by the Government Whips I would refuse to take the responsibility of signing the "pairs," because it was putting those members who had gone home, and who did not know what was coming on, in a false position ; and I say again that when a division which can serve no useful purpose except to flatter the vanity of the Premier is called for by the Government Whips I shall refuse to sign the "pair" sheet. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) .- With re- gard to this question of "pairs," it is not that any one objects to taking a division when necessary, but we do object when there is no need for a division. Mr. O'MEARA (Pahiatua) .- I fail to see why this question has been introduced by the honourable gentleman, as his name has never been referred to in connection with the "pairs." I ask you to rule, Sir, if the honourable gentle- man is in order. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- I cannot see that the question of "pairs " has anything to do with the debate on the Advances to Settlers Bill. Mr. HERRIES .- The Minister for Railways was not affected personally by the question of "pairs," but he was allowed to refer to it at con- siderable length. Mr. DEPUTY - SPEAKER .- My attention had not been drawn to the fact. Mr. HERRIES .- It seems to me, Sir, that you allowed the Minister for Railways to go very fully into the question of "pairs." I, ap- parently, am not to be allowed. Sir J. G. WARD .- I replied to the member for Franklin. Mr. HERRIES .- Why should I not reply to the Minister for Railways ? Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER. - My attention having been called to the matter, I must rule it is out of order. Mr. HERRIES .- Very well. With regard to the Bill, I suppose I may speak on the question of the Bill in reply to the Minister for Railways. Sir, the Minister for Railways called attention to the different figures given by different mem- bers of the House. These different figures are entirely due to the different figures given by the Ministers in charge of the Bill. I say "Ministers," because apparently there are two Ministers in charge. An Hon. MENBER .- Three. Mr. HERRIES. - Well, the Minister for Railways was too wise to put the figures down in this debate, nor did he do so in the second reading, though he did in Committee, where he was not reported. But the Premier, on the second reading, gave us the sum of £760,000 as being left out of the original loan, against which there was £200,000 pledged, which left £560,000. The Premier said also, in his speech on the second reading, there was £560,000 of liquid assets on the 31st March. The Minister who was in charge of the Bill gave us also on the second reading the sum of £760,000, and said a certain sum had to be placed against it, but he did not state the exact sum. Now, in 
<page:610>
Committee the Hon. the Minister in charge of | for the half-million. It seemed to us that there the department gave us the sum of £590,000 as being the amount available, and which he made up as follows : namely, £620,000 not raised on 31st March, from which he deducts £30,000 for expenses, and that leaves $590,000. Now, the Premier on this motion on the report gave us the sum of #620,000, from which he sub- tracts £90,000 so far as I understood him, making $530,000 at the 31st March. He said afterwards, in connection with a remark made by the honourable member for Riccarton, that he did not mean on the 31st March ; but he induced the House to believe there was only £530,000 available on the 31st March. That was the intention. Well, now, Sir, which of these statements are we to believe is correct ? Besides, Sir, nothing has been said about the $200,000 which the Premier admitted was miss- ing. Mr. SEDDON .- I never mentioned it, or said it was missing. Mr. HERRIES .- The Premier on the second reading did mention it. Mr. SEDDON .- No. Mr. HERRIES. - I have got a note of the Premier's own words. He said, as an interjec- tion in the course of the member for Bruce's speech, " Not to be raised, but $760,000 yet to be raised under the authority of the principal Act. Of this, only £560,000 now remains avail. able for investment on mortgage." The Minis- ter in charge of the department said on second reading, " There is a balance to be raised under the last statute of #760,000, but there is a sum of $200,000 already pledged against that amount." Mr. SEDDON .- I did not say that ; you put     that into my mouth. Mr. HERRIES .- Sir, the right honourable gentleman said £760,000 was yet to be raised, of which only $560,000 was available ; and I sub- tract the one from the other, and get £200,000, which bears out the contention of the Minister in charge of the department. Therefore we may safely assume that £200,000 has been pledged. I believe the Minister in charge of the department, because he gets his figures from the officers in charge of the department, and I believe there was $200,000 pledged, because he says there was. Well, that was one of the reasons why we considered there was not suffi- cient reason shown for advancing more than $500,000. If the department could go and pledge £200,000, apparently, they were not very much in want of funds, and what still further impresses me in that view is the Premier's own statement this evening, that the Superinten- dent of the Advances to Settlers Department had told him that there would be $100,000 available at the 31st March next. That is to say, after paying out all the moneys likely to be lent. Well, Sir, if there is $100,000 available on the 31st March next, if we had voted half a million this year there would be $600,000 left for the next year, and therefore it seems to me that half a million would have been quite sufficient for the purpose of advances to settlers. And that is why I and others voted Mr. Herries was not suthcient explanation of what hap- pened to the $200,000 which the honourable member in charge of the department said « as pledged somewhere or other, and it seemed to us also that there was not sufficient reason given why more than $500,000 should be ad- vanced. That is the reason why we voted against it. Sir, the Premier is going to call for a division on the third reading, and I very strongly object to this practice of calling for divisions which are not called for by this side of the House. Mr. MILLS .- You do not like them. Mr. HERRIES .- No, Sir, it does not affect me as, I am going to vote for the third reading, and I think a great many of those on this side of the House, if they were present, would also vote for the third reading. We have done our best to reduce the sum of money to be hor- rowed, but having failed in that, I intend to vote for the third reading of the Bill, because I believe in the principle of advances to settlers. I always have done so, and shall continue to do so. I believe the advances to settlers legis- lation has done a great deal of good to the country. I admit that, and that the measure has come to stay. I have always believed in it, and shall continue to vote upon it, but I do not believe in raising money when it is not wanted, or in trying to raise more than is also- lutely necessary. And in regard to the practice of calling for divisions when they are not called for by the other side, that only makes me feel the utmost contempt for those who call for them. Mr. ELL (Christchurch City) .- Sir, I have not taken up much time this evening. We listened a short time ago to a twenty-minutes speech from the Minister for Railways, which was mainly repetition, for nearly every state- ment he made had been affirmed by the Pre- mier and by the Minister in charge of the department, and, in addition to that. rive minutes was thrown in with regard to "pairs." Sir, I do not propose to touch any of those ques- tions. I think they have been dealt with over and over again, till every one almost is sick of hearing the arguments for and against. The Minister for Railways mentioned, referring. I understand, to my friend the honourable memu- her for Lyttelton, that the honourable memir had opposed and was against State borrowing altogether. The Minister for Railways stat. d that without this credit the colony would not have had the many advantages it now enjoyed. But my honourable friend, Mr. Lauren- c. said nothing of the sort. What he called attention to was, and, I think, properly, this: that we had paid away in interest no less a sum than forty millions sterling in the last twenty-six years. It was a valuable statement to make. and it was one the honourable member mad. only after a deal of research for the necessary figures. We had piled up a debt of forty-nutie millions, with an annual charge of intensi of over two millions, on the shoulders of the people of the colony, and it was about time we tried if some other means could not be adopted 
<page:611>
that would lesson the amount of interest and | the English bondholders and pledging our the consequent burdens on the people. I agree with the Minister for Railways that we must have credit to carry on the works of the State. We must have railways-the people are crying out for them - we must have roads and bridges, and we must have public institutions, and works of this kind cannot be carried on without credit. But the method adopted in the past of going to the foreign bondholders and getting his credit, which is simply created by the banking in- stitutions, should not be any longer pursued. Let me say here that I care not a snap of the fingers as to what people may say about my being brought up on "State bank pap " or any such twaddle. I do not mind the whole of their ridicule, whether it comes from news- papers or individuals, because I believe this: When we are landing our people in for heavy interest-charges, and are paying over one-third of our total revenue every year in interest, it is time we considered whether we cannot take some steps to check it. As an instance of the interest we pay, let me mention that in 1898 a return was furnished to the House in connection with the million loan for the North Island Main Trunk line. That return showed that over $420,000 had been paid in interest, and that the whole of the million is still owing. Sir, a statement was made by the Right Hon. the Treasurer that it was not only #140,000 that the Bank of New Zealand had advanced to the Government, but that the Bank had created another credit of $90,000 in favour of the Government ; in all, #230,000. Now, where did the Bank get that credit from ? As I have said before, and I repeat it now, it did not print any more notes or create any more gold, or silver, or copper coinage ; it simply created that credit and charged the Government in- terest on it ; and I say if the Manager of the Bank of New Zealand can create a credit in favour of the Government by a mere scratch of the pen to the extent of £230,000 at 4 per cent., the State can do it just as well as the Bank of New Zealand, and I challenge any member of the House to say that that could not be done. If a bank that is bolstered up can create that credit in favour of the Government, a State bank could do it ; and the interest would be saved to the taxpayers, and when we are load- ing our people with interest every year that is a question we might very well consider. Now, the Post - Office Savings- Bank has a large deposit - nearly six millions sterling. It is now collecting the interest and the prin- cipal, and is acting as a great help to the Advances to Settlers Office. What is that office? Practically, it is a State loan office. Why cannot we have our own State bank of issue, and assume control of the issue of the currency of this country, and act as a bank of deposit, and manage our bank in the same common-sense way in which private banks are managed-creating credit and charging interest upon it? If it can be done successfully in the case of a private bank it can also be done successfully in the case of a State bank. I do not see why we should be constantly going to credit, and paying interest on our bonds simply on credit, for there is actually no coin behind it. When the member for Lyttelton was speak- ing on the currency question some member made some disparaging remark upon Pennsyl- vania bonds. If the honourable member will take the trouble to look up the records he will find this in connection with those bonds : that the State paper money in connection with New Jersey, New York, et cetera., did not depreciate until the English Government took away the legal tender quality from that paper money ; so long as that paper money was good for the pay- ment of debts it was good. While I believe we could carry on a State institution- Mr. SEDDON .- I do not see what connec- tion that has with this Bill. Mr. ELL .- I say any means that can be devised for checking the loss to the community sustained under the present system would be a good thing for the country ; and this, I say, is the time for discussing that-when we are proposing to put on the shoulders of the com- munity, perhaps for forty years, another loan and interest on it for the whole of that time. Mr. . DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- I must really ask the honourable member to come back to the question before the House. The honour- able member is getting a little bit wide of the Bill-he is going too much into detail with respect to establishing a State bank. Mr. ELL .- I was answering the objections which have been stated, that we could not create our own credit, and I am contending this: that we could create our own credit and could save the interest we are now paying to the money-lender at Home. There is a direct connection between those two things. If the Premier wants any examples, let him go to Russia, where they have a State bank - Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- I must rule this discussion out of order. It would be more ap- propriate on the financial debate than at the present time. I think the honourable member is going beyond the four corners of the Bill now under discussion. Mr. ELL .- Then, I must satisfy myself with this : that the rate of interest could be reduced for the relief of settlers by the State establish- ing a State bank of issue and for the purpose of creating credit. Instead of the settlers having to pay the English bondholder 4 per cent. and a margin to defray the cost of working the department, their interest could be reduced by the State creating its own credit. The Premier has admitted in the House more than once that such a scheme could be brought into operation so that we could create our own credit, and I trust that will be done in the near future. I ask the honourable gentleman to take a note of this. If he will turn to the deposits in the five banks and in the Post-Office Savings-Bank he will find that in these six institutions there are over $22,000,000 of de- posits, and yet there is only two millions of gold, and if there was a run they could never meet the demand, and the State would have to come in. This shows clearly that to carry on 
<page:612>
successfully and with the fullest safeguards the | from the time I made the announcement as to State must take over the currency. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER. - I must again interpose; the honourable gentleman is again going outside the subject. Mr. ELL. - I have concluded. Mr. BARCLAY (Dunedin City) .- I am not going to detain the House. I merely wish to say that I regret the question raised by the honourable member for Christchurch City has been ruled outside the four corners of the debate, because his speech 'was of a very interesting and important character, and I myself am largely in accord with what he says. Sir, it seems to me a monstrous thing that we should have to pile up our debt in the way we do, until it has reached over forty-nine millions. It seems to me extraordinary that we should hardly be able to build a mile of rail- way in this colony without the permission of a number of gentlemen in London. regard this question of the issue by the State of its own notes as one of very great moment, and I trust that on another more opportune occasion the whole subject will be fully dis- cussed during the session. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- I must say this Bill has had a very chequered career. There are only about four members in the House who would have the courage of their opinions and vote openly against it. I can name them : the honourable member for Hawke's Bay, the honourable member for Waitemata, the honourable member for Patea, and the honour- able member for the Bay of Plenty. Mr. HERRIES .- No; I am going to vote for it. Mr. SEDDON. - I thought you were object- ing to voting at all. I can only now mention three. Yet the business of the country has been delayed for four days over a Bill there are not four members against. It proves most conclusively that, whilst the pressure from the people forces members to support the measure, if they dared or acted according to their own selfish convictions they would do their best to prevent its going on the statute-book. Now, I would much prefer that members 1.30. opposed to the measure, like the new member for Patea, told me so, as he did. That honourable member said he was not in love with it, and that he would certainly vote against it. I would rather have that than that members should delude their constituents. They get elected by telling their constituents that they will vote for measures like this, and when they come here they do their best to prevent the necessary moneys being raised. Amongst those I allude to is the honourable member for Riccarton. I do not wish to be drawn into a false position, and as I do not desire to keep the House very long I will briefly refer to some of the arguments against the Bill in its present stage. The member for Hawke's Bay (Captain Russell), when speaking after me, said the only reason why moneys had not been advanced was that the moneys had been lent to other departmen's. I say, Sir, that not a single shilling of the moneys raised under this Act Mr. Ell the £76,000 has gone anywhere except to the settlers of this country ; and all this fuss, and all this pretended stir, over the £200,000 was made for one or two things: those responsible for it are either dull of intellect, or are so incapable of grasping finance that, in my opinion, they are absolutely incapable of being intelligent representatives of the people. I say the matter was put as plainly as tongue could put it, that there was £760,000 of the old loan untouched ; that there was advanced sums of £140,000, £60,000, and £30,000 on short- dated debentures, but at different periods. As I said before, I now repeat, that on the 31st March last there was #760,000 of the old loan un- touched; but short-dated debentures are always issued against moneys that cannot be raised by way of loan. It was not advisable to raise £760.000, and, to get the moneys for settlers short-dated debentures were issued, and the I bank advanced the amount. Therefore, an advance was made to the department so that it could lend it to the settlers. If I were to speak on this subject until to - morrow 1 could not alter the situation. As to the suggestion that the money was to help other de partments, I would like honourable members to examine their Statement. Could they show where that had been done ? As they could not do so, they could only come to one conclusion, and that was that the statement certified to as being correct by the Controller and Auditor- General was in reality false. If it is false, then that gentleman was not fit to be in his position. On the other hand, the Superintendent of the department had no right to be in his position if he places before us statements that are certified to as correct but which are incorrect. Consequently, this nonsensical talk about the moneys being raised to advance to other de- partments simply emanated from the brain of those who would like that to be really the case. so that they might have an opportunity of injuring the Advances to Settlers Office. It has been said that there has been a discre- pancy. The amount of loan unraised and at the command of the administration of the department stood at £760.000. He de- liberately told the House that about £140.000 and £90,000 had been the amount tem- porarily advanced. Advanced from what ? From the Bank of New Zealand, on short- dated debentures, to the department. Then, I come to the member for Riccarton. He says that if half a million was granted we should have sufficient money to carry on with for over two years. How the honourable member can for a moment keep on repeating that statement I cannot understand. I have said-and I give it to him again and to the House -that, on the average lending, we should have of loan-moneys less than $100,000 on 31st March last. If. therefore, as he says, we had been lending it &t the rate of £600,000 a year, and we have only the half-million that is granted, according to his showing, then you would have only £100.000: then what is to fill up the interregnum between that and the meeting of Parliament ? 
<page:613>
Mr. MASSEY .- Repayments. Mr. SEDDON .- " Repayments ! " Honour- able members will keep hanging on to that miserable fallacy. You cannot with safety depend on moneys coming in as refunds. It may not be convenient for the people to send in the whole of the money ; and if we are to depend alone on the money coming in for the purposes of the Advances to Settlers De- partment, I say, where should we be in less than three months? If the finances of that department were to depend upon that, I say there would soon be an end of it. You might just as well put up the shutters at once. And the member for Riccarton, while profes- sing to be a supporter of this measure, and while professing to be a supporter of the advances to settlers-if he advocates their wait- ing until the money comes in for it to carry on with, I simply say it would be better for him to openly denounce the advances to settlers, and better for him, because it would be a more dignified and proper course to say, "I am en- tirely opposed to it." But to say, " I have always been a supporter of it" and yet to cripple it in the way in which the honourable member sug- gests is to me incomprehensible. We shall find when the voting is taken on the third reading that the honourable member for Riccarton who voted to reduce the amount to £500,000 will be voting to give me the whole million ; either that, or he will be out of the House and amongst the missing altogether or will be found voting for the Bill. Now, let members watch. Then, Sir, if he thinks this half-million is suffi- cient and the million would be a wrong thing for the colony, his proper position is to vote against the third reading of the Bill. But I have my doubts whether he will do that. The general public may understand when they see the voting on the second reading that you may alter your ground between the second and the third reading; but when they read that you supported the second reading, and afterwards voted to keep the measure off the statute-book no explanation on the platform will get over the fact that you voted in that way. That is why there is a little uneasiness in the minds of some members at the present moment. The honourable member for Riccarton, with the view of creating alarm again-I do not know whether he is responsible-made the state- ment that the finances of the colony were in a serious position. He says, "I find the public works expenditure for the last quarter was $400,000." Sir, four fours are sixteen- £1,600,000 a year. That would be the case, would it not? Now, Sir, the honourable member takes the total of £400,000 for this particular three months. He is not the only one who has been led astray in respect to this matter. He is not the only one who has had grave anxiety. He says that Ministers have been looking pale as they came out of the Cabinet room. I undertake to say that he has not seen my honourable colleague the Minister for Railways looking pale. I undertake to say that not even the illness he had lately made him look pale. With respect to this £400,000 for the quarter, I hope the Press will take the opportunity I give them, and that it will relieve them of some little anxiety, and that it will relieve the people of the colony of some little anxiety, when I say that during the last three months shipments of locomotives, railway- wagons, and rails have been teeming in. These, of course, have to be paid for immedi- ately they are put on board, and this is what has caused the abnormal drain during the last three months. It is not $400,000 on the ordinary railway construction ; it is not the ordinary expenditure out of the Public Works Fund for the construction of roads and tracks, but it has been these shipments and demands during the last three months, and which can- not possibly continue during the next nine months. It is morally impossible it should be so. And that is why it looks from the Statement as though our expenditure on public works was a million and three-quarters in the year. I say it will be nothing of the sort. I have now told the honourable member. He raised the question of the £400,000. I have given him the reasons why there is this abnormal expenditure. We gave last year half a million for additions to open lines, but if you look at the papers you will find that only £325,000 was expended before the 31st March ; and, consequently, these amounts are coming in now which are out of that par- ticular vote. And it is not the public works vote which has made this abnormal increase. I hope, now, that the honourable member and those honourable members who say there was this grave anxiety, and that the Public Works Fund had got into this terrible condition, and that the Treasurer appears asleep, and that the Ministers are not watching carefully what was going on, I hope, now they have got this explanation, that these honourable members will sleep sound, for we will not have this £400,000 again coming to charge for the next three months, and we will not have the ex- penditure going on at the rate of the last three months. That is the explanation, and I make it now, for before the financial debate is over I know the question will come up again, and I will thus forestall it. I see that the honourable member for Riccarton already feels relieved, and that he is beginning to draw closer. Then, the honourable member said we had the temerity-I might almost say the audacity-to hold back payments in Dunedin. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- I never said that. Mr. SEDDON .- Well, one member, at all events, mentioned the holding back of the pay- ment of the expenses in connection with the visit of the Imperial troops at Dunedin. I think it was on the second reading, and I thought it was the honourable member ; and if my memory is defective, well and good. An honourable member said that we are hold- ing back payments from Dunedin in connec- tion with the Imperial troops. What was the fact? Some gentlemen in Dunedin sent out invitations, and invited officers and others to a smoke concert. They enjoyed it, and sent the bill in to the Government. Well, natu- rally, the Government did not pay it; and 
<page:614>
then, because we did not pay it, we are accused of having held back payments, which shows the frightful condition of our Trea- sury ! I simply say this : the total amount, I believe, incurred in the City of Dunedin, be- cause that city did its duty in a manner which reflected the greatest credit on it -- the hospi- tality it showed to the Imperial forces-the great patriotism they showed in Dunedin and Otago is worthy of all praise, and, as far as the Government is concerned, it is in favour- able contrast with what was done in other parts of the colony. Sir, the total amount chargeable for entertaining the Indian and Im- perial troops in Dunedin would not amount to more than about £300; so that we cannot have the whole £300, and what a frightful state our finances must be in! Yet some members say, with some sense of responsibility, that we were holding back payments. The whole thing is so absurd and ridiculous that I am surprised at any member who aspires to come on the Trea- sury benches making such a statement- An Hon. MEMBER .- Oh, no. Mr. SEDDON .- But they do aspire to come here, and yet they are absolutely ignorant of the very first principle of finance, and that they are demonstrating all the time. I say that a member who stands up and makes careful ad- dresses to the House and his fellow-members, if he is careful and makes good his contentions, and shows that he is absolutely fair, he is bound to work his way up. He is bound to have the confidence of his fellow-members ; but a member who always makes a hotchpotch of figures, and not a single statement of whom can be relied on, and who coolly tells you that he does so in order to get that statement contradicted-that mem- ber, Sir, will never see the Treasury benches, because he will never have the confidence of his fellow-members. Then, in order to show his knowledge of financial lobscouse -- the Scotch word hotchpotch is about the same thing-we were told by the member for Ric- carton that the department had only £29,000 cash in hand, and he quoted from the State- ment that this was correct. Sir, the honour- able member is quite correct in that amount. It was £29,000. Then, he said we only raised £30,000 since, and therefore, he said, all that we had had for three months' advances under the Advances to Settlers Act was ±59,000. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- I never said that. Mr. SEDDON .- The honourable gentleman said that is all we had. An Hon. MEMBER. - £59,000. Mr. SEDDON .- That is $59,000 ; and the honourable gentleman wished to infer that as we had only £29,000 cash, and had only received $30,000 since, we did not require any more ; and he wanted to show that, taking the €59,000, there was no necessity for raising any more money. He did not say this, it is quite true, but the inference was to be deduced that going on at this rate we only wanted $59,000 for three months. I say the honourable member, when he is told by the department that we must have half a million, and they are lending at the rate of half a million-his own common-sense Mr. Seddon ought to tell him that £59,000 would not be looked at for advances during the three months. Then, Sir, I must ask honourable members to contrast the next statement made. He said the Government have acted prudently in respect to the administration of this department. Am I correct in that statement ? Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- Yes, with regard to the lending of money. Mr. SEDDON .- The terms used were that "the Government have acted prudently in respect to the administration of this depart- ment." Now, the honourable gentleman quali- fies that by saying "lending of the money." Well, what greater proof do you want if the Government is capable and prudent in lending out the money ? Why should you hesitate to give them more money to lend out ? An Hon. MEMBER .- Why bother about it ? Mr. SEDDON .- The only reason is this : Why show a want of confidence in the Govern- ment, whose administration is prudent or per- fect ? I say the whole position is so illogical and untenable that no other member of the House would take it up. The honourable member for Franklin, the honourable member for Hawke's Bay, and members on that side of the House would never admit that. Mr. MASSEY .- We know better. "Mr. SEDDON. - Of course ; they are con- sistent. They say, " We do not trust your ad- ministration. If we thought you were prudent and careful administrators we would give you two millions; but because we do not think you are prudent we do not give you money." But the member for Riccarton-their new supporter. the forerunner of the "left wing" party. be- cause he generally starts " a left wing " wherever he goes-does not hold these views. I hope honourable members opposite will bear that in mind. I know why we have had this attack made upon the Advances to Settlers Office. I am not unmindful of what has occurred in the past. I do not wish on this occasion to obtrude the black list ; but have honourable members not read this? "The Government wanted strengthening ; they wanted some one who had a thorough knowledge of finance upon these benches." And, Sir, what has been the cause. in my opinion, of this criticism, adverse and other- wise, by one or two honourable members is this : they want to demonstrate to my worthy friends and supporters here that if they were on these benches they would be a tower of strength to us. As it has been proved that every statement made has been incorrect, I hope my honouraice friends will take warning and keep them out in the cold shades of Opposition. I warn mem- bers to have nothing to do with those whose figures and statements are so fallacious. Then. Sir, I will deal gently with the member for Patea-the young man Absalom. The honour- able member said I made a statement to West Coast members that there was no money ava !!- able for any purpose. That statement, I see. appeared in the papers, and I want at once to give it an emphatic contradiction. I never made any such statement at all. At the deputation 
<page:615>
in question there were no reporters present, and whatever was given out was given out by some member of the deputation. An Hon. MEMBER .- By yourself ? Mr. SEDDON .- No, not by myself. I saw something in the paper that that was inspired, but, I repeat, it was never inspired or seen by me, and no one was more astonished than I was when I saw it in print, because I never made the statement at all. What the deputa- tion came to see me about was an increased public works expenditure-in fact, they wanted another railway ; and I could not possibly, see- ing the heavy public works expenditure, and the importance of some of the other works, give them any encouragement, and I told them so very plainly. I at the same time said that in respect to this money, amounting to two millions, at the present time that would leave a burden of £70,000 by way of interest on the consolidated revenue, and that the con- solidated revenue had enough to bear at pre- sent, and that the estimates of receipts and expenditure as submitted, and as then be- fore me, gave me some anxiety. I might have gone further. But it was simply the first blush, and when the matter was considered it proved-and you have had the result-that there was no cause whatever for anxiety. As to sayi. g that there was no money available for public works, that is absolutely incorrect, and I take this opportunity now of stating so, and I thank the honourable member for mention- ing it, as this gives me the opportunity of re- futing it at once, and, I hope, for all time. The honourable member has also learned another lesson. He has learned the lesson that when he receives letters from his constituents, com- plaining of hardship and injustice at the hands of a department of the State, he should always make inquiry before he uses them. Probably a settler whom he may know sends a letter of this kind that seems very hard at the first blush, but time after time things are kept back and public departments and the heads of depart- ments are misjudged. I stand here in defence of the departments, and I say that, as many members know, communications are received which would bear a very different complexion if members had before them the information which is before the department and before the Minister. From these letters you must always subtract a good deal. In the case the honour- able member referred to, and which has got into liunsard, what were the facts? An ap- plication was made, an advance was asked for, and there was a second mortgage on the pro- perty that was never disclosed at all. The department could not with safety have lent the money ; and the declaration made might, if extreme steps had been taken, have landed the applicant into trouble. However, the depart- ment, as is the case with all lending depart- ments, is of a somewhat secret character, and the Government do not intend to take further action, therefore, in respect to the matter, although we have been called upon to clear ourselves and to vindicate the depart- ment. I hope the honourable member for Patea will take a lesson from this, and will be very careful before he again quotes a communica- tion of this character, or suggests that the lending department does not lend except to parties of the "right" colour. I take my stand here, Sir, and I say, without the least hesitation, if a return were produced of those who have received the greatest benefit from the advances to settlers it would be found that those have most benefited who have voted against the Government and have opposed the passing of this legislation. That, Sir, would be the undoubted result. I now come to the ques- tion raised regarding voting upon the third reading. I am told that unless the people who object to a measure call for a division on the third reading the question should be allowed to be taken on the voices. I say it is the inherent right of any 2.0. honourable member, if he wishes & division on any question, to get that division. Our Standing Orders provide for it, and those who are afraid to go into the lobbies and have their votes recorded are afraid to meet the people, and are afraid of their own actions. The time-honoured custom was a vote on the second reading ; the time-honoured custom was a vote on the third reading, and you could then always trace the members and their works, and their works went before the people. And to say now that they are afraid of the third reading of the Bill proves that they are not sincere. They fought the Government in Committee ; they endeavoured to prevent the measure going on the statute-book ; but let me tell them it is here to stay. There is a million of money to be borrowed, and we shall prove to New Zealand and to the world that, with prudence and care- ful administration, the result will be that the private lenders, the lending institutions, and the capitalists must admit that the Legislature of this country fixes what the interest shall be on borrowed moneys.

Colonel BAILLIE .- Sir, I rise to a point of order. An occurrence took place last night in Committee, and I wish to bring up a report on the subject, as follows :- "While the Council was in Committee of the Whole on the Shops and Offices Bill, on Thursday, the Hon. Mr. Jones used language to which an honourable gentleman took objec- tion, and I thought fit to request that the remark should be withdrawn. The Hon. Mr. Jones claimed the right to use the language objected to, and declined to withdraw it. A motion was therefore carried that I should report to the Council the refusal of the Hon. Mr. Jones to obey the Chair." I think that is about what took place, as well as I can put it on paper. I asked the Hon. Mr. Jones to withdraw the remarks which he had made, and he declined to do so, and the Committee then passed a resolution that I should bring it up under the notice of the Council and of yourself. The Hon. Mr. ORMOND .- Sir, ought not the Council to know what was the offence com- mitted before we deal with the matter ? What were the terms complained of for which that honourable gentleman was called to account ? The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- I think the question simply was this : that last night the Hon. Mr. Jones, unfortunately, to my mind, did not see fit to obey the ruling of the Chair. I have always been bound to believe that dis- cussions in a Chamber of this kind are only possible when the Chair is obeyed in matters of order. The Chair may be right, the Chair may be wrong ; but, still, if the Chair rules that a certain course should be followed, I think it is the duty of everybody in a Chamber like this to obey the ruling of the Chair. I do not give any expression of opinion as to the language used ; I do not think that enters into the question at all ; but, if the Chair rules a certain matter to be out of order, I think every one of us ought to be able to see his way to obey the ruling, quite apart from the merits of the language used. I trust, therefore, that the honourable gentleman who unfortunately came into con- flict with the Chair in Committee last night will see his way to withdraw from the position he took up. I am not expressing any opinion as to the language used ; but, still, I take it that one of the first rules we have got for the conduct of our business is that in this matter the direction of the Chair should be followed. The Hon. the SPEAKER .- The only point I have to consider is the refusal of the honour- able gentleman to obey the Chair. It is no part of my duty, nor have I anything to do with the decision as to whether the words used were parliamentary or not. There can be no possible doubt that it is my duty to support the Chair- man of the Committee, and I therefore call upon the honourable gentleman who used the words -that I understand were offensive to another honourable member-to withdraw those words : and I am quite sure that he will see that by so doing he will best consult not only his own dignity, but the dignity of the Council. The Hon. Mr. JONES. - Sir, I am willing to accept the position. I am, of course, conscious that, whatever may be the ruling of the Chair in this Council, it is the duty of every honourable member to obey that ruling, for the sake of his own dignity and self-respect and in order to facilitate the proper conduct of the public busi- ness of this Chamber. I therefore submit to the ruling of the Chairman in regard to my conduct last night. But, while I cannot but express regret at the occurrence, I feel it is due to myself to explain that my refusal last night to submit was consequent upon my impression at the outset that the Chairman did not definitely decree that I had committed a breach of the rules which are designed to guide this Council in the conduct of its business ; and also to my conviction that such a decision could not possibly have been intended by the Chair. I was justified in taking this view by the doubts repeatedly expressed and the questions persistently put to the Chair by other When I realised the honourable gentlemen. truth, I had committed myself to a certain line of conduct from which I naturally enough was reluctant to retire. I understand that this explanation and submission to the ruling of the Chair do not necessarily imply any acknow- ledgment on my part that the language I used on the occasion was unparliamentary, and such as I had no right to use in this Council. At the same time I wish to add that I had no in- 
<page:617>
tention whatever of reflecting on the personal character of any honourable gentleman of this Council, or of any other person whose misfor- tune it is to be engaged in the liquor traffic. This explanation will, I trust, settle the diffi- culty which developed as a result of the protest against the language which I used, for it is ever made easy for an erring honourable gentle- man to rehabilitate himself in the good graces of this Council. But, as it is very desirable from every point of view that the question as to whether the language I used was unparlia- mentary or not should be definitely settled, as the Council last night desired to have your opinion, Sir, on that point, and as it will not be decided by you if the matter be left as it now stands, I repeat my allegation by declaring that the trathe which is pronounced by the highest ecclesiastical, medical, and judicial authorities to be the most fertile cause of crime, misery, insanity, pauperism, disease, and death may be fittingly described as "detestable." The Hon. the SPEAKER .- The honourable gentleman has explained at full length his view of the position, but, as I pointed out in the few words I felt it my duty to address to the Coun- cil, it is not a question of whether the words were unparliamentary or not. The honourable gentleman is well aware the ruling of the Chairman must be sustained, even if the Chairman is wrong. I understand the honour- able gentleman withdraws his words in obedi- ence to the ruling of the Chair. The Hon. Mr. JONES .- I do. VICTORIA COLLEGE. The Hon. Mr. REEVES asked the Minis- ter of Education, If the Government and Go-   vernors of Victoria College have come to any decision as to a site whereon the College build- ings shall be erected ? Honourable members would remember that the Victoria College Act was passed in 1898, so that it was nearly four years ago now since the measure came into force. From that time to the present there had been a considerable amount of discussion between the College Governors and the Govern. ment as to where the College should be housed. It was time now some decision was come to on the question. It was not a mere local matter, but a matter of general policy, and one that affected the good of all the provinces bordering on Cook Strait. He believed he was right in saying that the Government and the Governors of the College could get a place that was far more suitable than Wellington for the erection of the College. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER said, in reply to the honourable gentleman, he could only state that no decision had been come to on the matter between the Government and the Governors of the College.

IMPREST SUPPLY BILL (No. 3). A message was received from His Excellency the Governor recommending the House to make provision for salaries. On the question, That the message be re- ferred to the Committee of Supply, Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) said,-Sir, I think before we go into Committee on this Im- prest Supply Bill it is only right to ask the Government whether they are going, before we pay any salaries, or before we go into the finan- cial debate, to lay on the table of the House two very important statements, without which we can hardly go on with the Imprest Supply Lands Report and the Railways Report. Since 
<page:620>
to the financial debate without having both of these reports on the table of the House. The Lands Report especially is a most important report, and without that we can hardly vote on the Imprest Supply Bill, or on the Financial Statement and estimates. There is no reason why these reports should not have been down before, and I think it is trifling with the House that we should be expected to enter on the financial debate without having the informa- tion that every member of the House is en- titled to have. The Railways Report is also a most important report, and, considering that we have got to deal with the voting of moneys for the railways, I think on coming to the estimates, and considering the Railway accounts are kept in a different manner from the other Treasury accounts, and considering the Railway accounts are not subject to the Auditor-General, but have a separate audit, I think we are entitled to have the fullest information. Besides these reports, there is a most important parliamen- tary paper that the Premier has put off from time to time-that is, the paper known as B .- 1 and no one can understand the position of the finances of the colony without it. I am not sure that we ought to vote for this Imprest Supply Bill until we have the full account given us about the finances of the country, and that no one can get unless they have the B .- 1. return before them. I had hoped that these reports would have been laid on the table of the House, but I regret that neither the Minister for Railways nor the Minister of  Lands has thought fit to do so. The Mining Report ought also to have been laid on the table of the House before now, and it seems to me that the House will be lacking in wisdom if the debate is entered on before these three reports and the return B .- 1 is laid on the table of the House. There is another matter I wish to draw the attention of the House to-I think I am entitled to speak on any matter of grievance- and that is the question of petitions. These are sent to this House day after day, and are recom- mended by the Petitions Committee and various other Committees to which they are referred to the consideration of the Government, but then everything seems to be lost sight of. Now, I consider a grievous wrong is being done to the people of this country, and especially to those who petitioned this House. Year after year petitions are sent in. They are considered by various Committees and are recommended for favourable consideration, and yet the Govern- ment calmly ignore them, and nothing is done. I think on the present estimates there are only one or two recommendations that have been given effect to, and one of those is on a petition that was sent to the Upper House. It seems to me that is a matter this House should endeavour to attend to and to correct. I think it is the duty of the Government, on receiving the recommendations of the Committee, to try to give effect to those recommendations. Many of these recommendations require legislation, and year after year we see at the latter end of the session-probably in the last week of the sess- Mr. Herries ing down a Bill that is generally known as the "Washing-up Bill." But that Bill is seldom persevered with ; and, so far as I can see, the petitioners whose claims are recommended by Committees are in a manner laughed at by the Government. I do not say this Government particularly, because all Governments seem to have a disregard for the feelings of petitioners ; but, so far as I can see, during the last two or three sessions this has been particularly bad, and hardly any of the petitions that have been recommended have been given effect to. I trust that by calling public attention to this the Government may see fit, and I trust they will see fit, to give more consideration to the petitions that have been recommended by the various Committees that have sat on them than up to the present they have done. Mr. LANG (Waikato) .- I should like to say one or two words in reference to what has been mentioned by the honourable member for the Bay of Plenty respecting the petitions that come before this House. When first I had the honour of a seat in this House I sat for many years as a member of the Public Peti- tions M to Z Committee. On that Committee we took an enormous amount of time carefully considering petitions. We had the evidence of both sides, and when the Committee thought a petition was a desirable one, and that the petitioner had a just claim, it was referred to the Government for their favourable con- sideration. I am speaking of petitions gene- rally now, but I could give particular cases if necessary. I say that out of a large number of the petitions referred to the Government for favourable consideration it was quite the exception for any one of them to receive con- sideration. So much was that so, that, for my part, I asked that my name should be taken off the Committee, as I looked upon service upon that Committee as being more or less 3 waste of time, as the Government took no notice whatever of the recommendations of the Committee. Since then there have been many petitions presented to the House in respect of which Committees have made re- commendations to the Government for favour- able consideration, but those recommendations were altogether ignored. I think it is time that petitioners knew that it is almost useless to petition the House, and to have their peti- tions considered by a Committee, for in peti- tioning their time is almost always wasted. They had better petition the Government. When Committees consider a petition they hear all sides, but the Government, when they consider the report on a petition, simply go by what the department has to say, and ignore the other side altogether. I think it is time the public knew how little use it is to petition, as the Government do not seem to be guided in any way by the report of the Com- mittee when brought down. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways). - I think the question raised by the honouralde member for the Bay of Plenty is one that should be fairly answered. The honourable 
<page:621>
member has asked when the Railways and the Lands Reports will be laid on the table. In doing that the honourable member is doing what any member has a right to do, particularly in view of the fact that the financial debate is about to commence. I can assure the honour- able gentleman that neither the Railways Report nor the Lands Report has been detained through any want of attention on the part of the Go- vernment. On the contrary, both reports are being prepared as rapidly as possible, and we hope within the next week to have the reports ready, and as soon as they are ready they will be laid upon the table of the House. It is not possible for the Government to do impossibili- I am ties in connection with these reports. anxious that the Railways Report should be placed on the table of the House. I should like it to have been there before now, but it has been found impossible to get it ready sooner. The same is the case with regard to the Lands Report. An Hon. MEMBER .- Why ? Sir J. G. WARD .- The pressure of work has been very great, and, as I have said, the depart- ments cannot do impossibilities. As far as the Railways Report is concerned, it is nearly ready, and as soon as it is available to be placed on the table of the House that will be done, for we wish honourable members to have the fullest information regarding the working railways for their guidance during the course of the debate. I rose chiefly for the purpose of saying that these reports are not being kept back, and that anything the Government can do to hurry them on will be done ; more than that I cannot promise. I would like to point out to the House that, for fully a month before Parlia-   ment met here, many of the responsible railway officials were away from Wellington in connec- tion with the visit of the Duke and Duchess of York. Honourable members may not think so, but I can assure them that it was the case : they had to be all over the colony, and away from the seat of Government. An Hon. MEMBER .- What were they doing ? Sir J. G. WARD .- They were doing their duty, as the honourable member knows per- fectly well. Take the Railways Department, for instance. The honourable member knows per- fectly well that the head of the Railways De- partment had to accompany the whole of the Royal trains, and that the permanent officer in charge of the construction branch of the de- dartment had to specially devote himself to this important branch. Then, the head of the Locomotive Department was also upon all the trains in the colony, and I say that those ser- vices took these officials out of Wellington for quite a month before the meeting of Parlia- ment. An Hon. MEMBER .- Fourteen days. Sir J. G. WARD .- Surely the honourable member will see that these officials had to make arrangements before the arrival of the Royal party. Many of the arrangements had to be made previously, and the responsibility devolved upon them to be ahead of the tour, looking to different things that were required ; and all this took them away from Wellington, and so a certain amount of delay occurred, and was quite unavoidable. That was responsible to some extent for the initial delays in connec- tion with the reports asked for by the honour- able member. An Hon. MEMBER .- Does that apply to the Lands Report ? Sir J. G. WARD .- No; it applies specially to the Railways Report ; but the Lands Report, I understand, is about ready, and both reports will be laid upon the table of the House during the course of the financial debate, if we can get them. An Hon. MEMBER .-- If ? Sir J. G. WARD .- We will do our best to get them, and cannot do more, and the honour- able member could not do more either. Then, with regard to the other matter raised by the honourable member for the Waikato, and also the honourable member for the Bay of Plenty -- the non-dealing with petitions that are re- commended by the Petitions Committee-I should have thought the experience of those honourable members would have led them to realise that these petitions never are dealt with by any Government until preparations for the supplementary estimates are being made. Well, the desire of the Government is to do what is right and just both to petitioners and to the colony in the matter of petitions ; and there is undeniably a great deal of careful analysis and care required in dealing with petitions, which care the Government has to exercise in the interests of the country. With respect to some of the petitions sent by Committees, I am sorry to say the desire is apparently to do what they consider very generous actions, and in some cases the Government has to be a buffer for the purpose of standing between the petitioner and the country. It is the Govern- ment that is held responsible. With Commit- tees there is a disposition occasionally, when a pathetic case comes before them, to pass the claims to the Government with a strong recom- mendation, suggesting that many hundreds or thousands of pounds should be given. Then the duty devolves upon the Government of going through the claim in a colder and a calmer way for the purpose of ascertaining what is the actual position, and to see whether the claim is a legitimate one for which the colony is justly responsible, and, if so, to decide upon the amount that should be placed upon the supplementary estimates. I have now before my mind one or two cases where, I am sure, if the members who formed the Committees had had the responsibility of the Administra- tion of the day, and if such recommendations came to them, they could not conscientiously, in accordance with what they deem to be right, give effect to them, and ask the country to provide the money in order to make what in reality would be a present of the taxpayers' money to people who have been unfortunate. Where the line has to be drawn is between what one may term the responsibility of the country in some cases to pay large sums to people who have been unfortunate ; and if one 
<page:622>
only we should give immediate and favourable replies in every case. One's sympathies are always with those who have or are suffering ; but we are here to do our duty, and that is what we try to do. Take the instance of the fire petitions ; it would mean placing large sums of money not upon the particular department honourable members imagine ought to make provision, but it would mean placing a very large sum on the consolidated estimates and providing it out of the consolidated revenue, and asking the people of the colony to make provision for the unfortunate position of the petitioners, even though no want of proper care or safeguarding on the part of the Railway Department has been shown to have existed. Yet the Government are asked to provide many hundreds and thousands of pounds, and, I say, if the honourable members who form these Committees had the responsibility thrown on them as the Ministers have-to carefully review the recommendations-they would have to do what the Government endeavours to do to the best of their ability-to go through them, dis- carding ordinary motives of sympathy, and do what they believe to be just and right. And because the honourable member has not been able to get his way in relation to some petition, he makes the intimation to the House that he proposes to resign his seat on a Committee. Mr. LANG .- No; that I have done so. Sir J. G. WARD .- Well, that is not the way to effect reforms. If the recommendation of a Petitions Committee is being improperly set  aside, the right way would be for the honour- able member to stick to his position on the Committee, and keep on making representa. tions, and pointing out the want of proper    attention on the part of the Administration ; and I can assure the honourable member no member of this House would have more cour- tesy extended to his recommendations or views than the honourable member for Waikato. am sorry to see he is running away from what it is right for him to do, and I would recom- mend him to reconsider his position, and if any case is not rightly attended to, by representa- tions -- by correspondence with the Minister in charge of the particular department that the petition should come before-he should ask that it should come up before Cabinet for consideration at the right time, before the supplementary estimates are being framed. Honourable members will agree with me when I say that it is the duty of every member of the House, apart from members of the Ministry, to sift with care the many petitions that are sent up to the House for consideration. Some people even believe that if anything untoward happens to them by misfortune or accident they have only to make an appeal by petition to a Committee of the House, and they will get redress, and every consideration will be given to their claim. There has been a great deal tco much of it. There is one case where a spark flew into a man's eye, a considerable distance away from the railway-line, and he petitioned the House for compensation, on the ground Sir J. G. Ward and damaged his eye. An Hon. MEMBER .- He got $50. Sir J. G. WARD .- Yes; he got $50 upon the strong representation of a Petitions Com- mittee, who recommended that he get $:00. I do not remember the man's name, but I remember the case. Then, I think after that, some honourable members, prompted by a humane desire to see that this unfortunate man- who had in his affliction the entire sympathy of every one, no matter whether the spark came from an engine or not . re- ceived justice, made further strong representa- tions, and urged that the sum be increased by $100. The Petitions Committee made a strong recommendation about it. The evidence did not justify anything at all being paid. And so it goes on. If a person is riding or driving near a train, if his horse bolts, and anything happens, he immediately petitions the House and expects to receive consideration for him- self, his horse, and his dray. You necessarily sympathise with them; but why the Govern- ment should be asked to pay for unfortunate accidents-with which State departments have no more to do than if the man were travel- ling on horseback past a six - storied brick building, and by a convulsion of nature it happened to tumble over and cause his horse to bolt-why they should ask the people of the colony to provide them with monetary con- sideration for their misfortune I am unable to understand. The petitions with which every year I have had anything to do I know myself are carefully reviewed by more than one Minis- ter, in order that they may be properly deait with : they are thoroughly sifted, and then brought before the Ministry for the considera- tion of the whole Cabinet. Time and again, where necessary, they are gone through care- fully in this way. When the Government is doing in this what they believe to be in the interests of the colony, fault is found by the I member for the Bay of Plenty and the member for Waikato. Instead of having their criticism in a thankless and difficult task, we ought to have their sympathy, support, and co-opera- tion- Mr. HERRIES .- We give you our sympathy. Sir J. G. WARD .- We get that pretty well all round ; except in some cases, where we get the reverse. An Hon. MEMBER. - How about B .- 1 ? Sir J. G. WARD .- B .- 1 will be laid on the table as soon as it is ready, which I have no doubt will be particularly gratifying to my honourable friend. He has already had the assurance of the Government that every effort is being made to have it ready to be laid on the table. I can assure honourable gentlemen that nothing has been left undone by the Govern ment to have the returns from the different departments ready to be laid on the table. It is the easiest thing in the world-I have done it myself often, and I am likely, I suppose, to do it again - to find fault and criticize, and sav that particular work should be available at a particular time. Ministers cannot-nor are 
<page:623>
they going to-unnecessarily drive the officials of the departments, who are doing their best to carry out their duty in this matter. The Go- vernment instructions are that the returns are to be ready at the earliest moment in order that they may be presented; and they will be laid upon the table of the House as soon as ever the Government receive them. Mr. R. MCKENZIE (Motueka) .- Sir, I hope the House appreciated the "jobation " which it has just received from the Hon. the Minister for Railways, and I especially hope that honour- able members who render such arduous and faithful services on Select Committees enjoyed the castigation administered to them. In the case of the man who got a spark in his eye-he came from Christchurch-the position was that the Railway Department admitted it was their carelessness, and before he petitioned at all they paid him the $50 referred to by the Minister. This, however, was one in which there was rea- sonable room for doubting the colony's moral liability, and in which a majority of the mem- bers present at the hearing of the petition gave the petitioner the benefit of the doubt. Another case occurred in Napier, where the Railway Department seem to have a special license for slaughtering people ; they killed four men on a railway-crossing, and maimed two others for life on the same crossing there, and still persist in not appointing a crossing-keeper. The widow of the last man who was killed on the Sale Street crossing, Napier, and who is left with two children in very delicate health, petitioned this session for a compassionate allowance. The Railways Committee recommended this petition to the favourable consideration of the Govern- ment. Members of the Committee considered this unfortunate widow and the orphans equi- tably and morally entitled to have two or three years of the husband's wages. The Minister thought the department should main- tain its legal position. They killed three other people there before this happened, but they happened to be people who were well off, and their relatives made no claim on the colony. Now, Sir, while the department continues its short-sighted policy of saving a crossing-keeper's wages, the private people whom they injure have to suffer. Surely the widow and orphans of the last man killed there should be allowed some- thing from what was saved from a crossing- keeper's wages not having been paid there. Suppose an employé of a private individual was killed, would not his relatives come under the Compensation for Accidents Act? That is another case in point, which I will give the Minister time to digest. Sir, that petition has been reported on. I hope the Government will do justice to this family. Sir J. G. WARD .- We will do what is right. Mr. R. MCKENZIE .- I have no doubt ; but I have my doubts about Cabinet. I do not agree with the honourable member for the Bay of Plenty, because he is to blame to some extent for not getting attention paid to the case of his petitioners. When a petitioner who has a grievance comes to me, and I present the petition for him, I never lose sight of that petition, and I take care to chase after the people who are dealing with it until I obtain redress or proper consideration for it. Until the honourable member adopts the same principle the chances are that his petitioners will never get any redress at all. The members who sit on the Committees, of course, hear the evidence that is tendered in connection with these petitions, and the officers of the departments make reports on the cases ; but, as a matter of fact, I do not think that Ministers ever go through the evidence for themselves at all. They are not present at the Committees to hear the evidence, which is seldom printed, consequently they cannot know anything at all about the merits of the proceedings or the petitions. Now, Sir, coming to the reports, I agree with the honourable member for the Bay of Plenty that in this case it is abso- lutely impossible for the House to intelligently discuss the Financial Statement until those reports are laid on the table of the House. Take the railways, for instance, about which, I am sorry to say, a considerable amount of money has been spent in importing a lot of material. At any rate, we are not able to form an opinion satisfactory to ourselves how the money placed at the disposal of that de- partment is being used until we are placed in possession of the annual report. Then, take the Mines Report. There is a proposal in the Financial Statement to bring in legislation- this session, I suppose-to raise money to esta- blish a State coal-mine, and as soon as we get the Mines Report, and see what the require- ments of the colony are, we can deal with that question intelligently. Then, again, there is the Lands Report. That is a very important report indeed. We are borrowing money for advances to settlers and for land for settle- ments every year, and we certainly require to know what is being done with all that money, but until we get this report we cannot obtain that information. I say the House ought to insist on the financial debate being adjourned for another week or a fortnight until the Go- vernment can place these reports on the table. The excuse made by the Government that the heads of departments were busy during the Royal visit is no excuse at all ; or, if it is an excuse, it is a very lame one indeed, because there has been a lapse of actually two months since the Duke and Duchess left the City of Wellington. Now, surely during those two months there has been sufficient time to pre- pare these reports. Then, again, there is that important paper B .- 1. Is there a single mem- ber of the House who can satisfactorily deal with the finances of the colony until he gets B .- 1? I undertake to say there is not one ; and we are not likely to get B .- 1 this session. The Railways Report and B .- 1 are matters upon the preparation of which the clerks in the Govern- ment offices ought to have been employed long ago, so that they might be ready for the House at the proper time. Sir J. G. WARD .- The Printing Office has been blocked with the report of the Midland Railway Commission. 
<page:624>
Mr. R. MCKENZIE .- The Midland Railway Commission had to go round and examine a great many witnesses, and I venture to say, without egotism, they did their business to the satisfaction of the Government, the debenture- holders, and the country, as far as the scope of the inquiry permitted. Mr. GRAHAM .- They prepared their report in two days. Mr. R. MCKENZIE .- It did not take them very long. I will undertake to say that if the same question had been referred to the Cabinet it would take about six years-in fact, I doubt very much whether they would ever do it at all. Sir J. G. WARD .-- They had the services of a railway officer to prepare it for them. Mr. R. MCKENZIE .- I must give the Rail- way Department credit for having some very able men. If all the officers in the honourable gentleman's department were like the Gene- ral Manager, and the late Assistant General Manager, and the late Chief Commissioner of Railways, it would be better managed than it is, and the taxpayers would be getting better value for their money than they are getting at the present time. I do not wish to detain the House in connection with this matter, but at the same time I do not see my way clear to discuss the Financial Statement at all until we get the reports that I have mentioned. If any member brings forward a motion to postpone the debate, I shall certainly feel inclined to vote in favour of the debate being delayed until these reports are laid on the table. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) .- The Minister brushed away in a very light and airy manner the fact that these reports are not laid on the table of the House up to the present date. Now, Sir, I think it is about time the House did make up its mind as to whether the Public Accounts of the colony are to be prepared in time to be of value to members in discussing the finances of the colony. The fact is plain to everybody that the B .- 1 paper, which con- tains the Public Accounts of the colony, will be brought down so late that it will be practically useless for the purposes of the financial debate. Take, for instance, last year : the Public Ac- counts of the colony were laid on the table on the 3rd October. By that time Parliament was very nearly over ; and I take it that the Public Accounts this year will be brought down so late as to be useless. Now, with respect to these other papers, the Minister for Railways has referred to the Railways Report, and he states that the reason why that report is not down yet is that the railway officials were busily employed at the time of the visit of the Duke and Duchess. Well, the Duke of York was only here in New Zealand for a few days. The preparations for his visit may have taken a fortnight of the time of the railway officials ; I do not suppose they would take more; and the whole time of the railway officials could not have been longer than three weeks. Therefore there is no reason why the report itself should be very much later this year than it was last year. Last year the Railways Report was brought down on the 17th August, and I do not myself see that the excuse the Minister for Railways has urged is any real excuse at all, because the Duke of York did not come here until nearly the end of June. Now, why was not this report ready and in the hands of the Printer before the Duke of York came here at all? Our accounts for the year end on the 31st March, and that report could have been prepared, and along with the B .- 1 paper, placed in the hands of the Printer before the House met. Then, the honourable gentle- man urged that the Government Printing Office is blocked, and the reason why we cannot get these reports is because the Printing Office is so blocked. Now, Sir, why is it blocked ? If these papers and reports had been in the hands of the Printer before Parliament met that block would have been avoided. I have never known a session in which returnsordered by the House are so long in being placed on the table as is the case this year. I do not know the reason for that. and I cannot understand the reason for it. With respect to the printing of these reports of the Mines, Railways, and Lands Departments, I maintain they ought to have been prepared and placed in the hands of the Printer, and actually printed, before Parliament met, and I do not see why they should not have been ; and I again assert that the block at the Printing Office, which is assigned to-day as the excuse for these reports and papers not being ready, would have been avoided had the course I indicate been followed. With respect to the Lands Report and the Railways Report, and the Mines Report, I myself have been going through the Financial Statement, and I have come to this conclusion-and I wish, Sir, to make it public: that I take it to be absolutely impossible and unwise for any member to dis- cuss any question with respect to the railways or the lands in the financial debate without having had the opportunity of going through these reports. I shall myself refuse to discuss any questions dealing with lands or railways until we have got these two reports laid on the table. Other members may make an effort to discuss them without having these reports laid on the table. I do not see how they can, and especially how they can bring themselves up to date unless these two reports are on the table. Last year the Lands Report was laid on the table on the 7th August. Now, why is it not on the table on the 7th August this year? It cannot be the excuse in respect to the Lands Statement that the officials of the Lands Department looked after the Duke of York and his visit ; and I see no reason at all why the Lands Report has not been laid on the table even earlier this session than it was last. Then. Sir, with regard to the Mines Report, that report was laid on the table last year on the 31st July, and we have no statement of the Mines Department now on the 23rd August, twenty-three days later than last year-and last year the presentation was surely late enough. Nor is there any reason that the excuse should be urged in respect to the Mines Report that the officials were engaged 
<page:625>
any other visit. And, Sir, I take it that the Mines Report, and all these other reports, should have been in the hands of the Printer and printed before Parliament met at all, and we might have had them on the first day of ses- sion. Now, coming back to B .- 1, the Public Accounts of the colony, we have heard before that the reason why the Public Accounts of the colony are not laid on the table was because the Government had to await certain communica- tions from the Agent-General in respect to the finances from London. Now, these communi- cations, I think, on previous occasions never took Admitting that more than six or eight weeks. they require these six or eight weeks in which to complete the information they require from London, there is no reason why B .- 1, the Public Accounts of the colony, should not have been printed by the end of June : and I undertake to say that, if the Premier will form a Commission of inquiry-he is so fond of Commissions-to go down to the public offices and to see how long the B .- 1 Public Accounts of the colony in manuscript have been ready for the Printer, we will then see -- Mr. SEDDON .- Will you go on the Commis- sion ? Mr. J. ALLEN .- Yes ; I will go on the Com- mission if you will appoint me. Mr. SEDDON .- You are asking for a billet. Mr. J. ALLEN .- I do not want any pay for it, or even $40. Sir, I take it that if we could have a Commission of inquiry into the position of the B .- 1 paper we should find it had been ready for the Printer for some time, and that we might have had it for some time. I do not know whether it is done deliberately until the   financial debate is over, but it looks very like it. These were the four papers that have been referred to. There is one other which I think ought to have been laid on the table, and I refer to the Post and Telegraph Report. It was laid on the table last year on the 17th August. I suppose the same excuse will be made that the officials of the Post and Tele- graph Department were engaged in connec- tion with the visit of the Duke of York. It seems to me that the visit of the Duke of York is accountable for every ill that has happened to the colony this year ; and, if this is to be so, on any future occasion I trust we shall make some special preparations for the visit of any other Duke and Duchess, so that the proper business of Parliament may not be unnecessarily delayed. I see no reason why the report of the Post and Telegraph Department should not have been laid on the table on the first day of the session. All the details required are in the hands of the officials, and might have been in the hands of the Printer before Parliament met. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton) .- Sir, I am pleased to hear the remarks of honourable members protesting against the action of the Premier in forcing on the financial debate without these very important documents, es- pecially the Railways Statement, the Lands Statement, and Mines Statement. Now, Sir, VOL. CXVII .- 39. Minister for Railways just now stated that the Statement could not be prepared because the head officers of that department were engaged in connection with matters arising out of the visit of their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York. Sir, how much of the com- pilation of that statement-for, after all, it is only a compilation -- depends upon the personal services and labour of the head officers of the department ? Why, Sir, the only part that is written by the General Manager may almost invariably be stated to occupy not more than two folio pages of the report. It is the duty of the subordinate officers, of course, to pre- pare the returns, and it is these returns which members of this House ask for, in order that they may be able to estimate fairly the position of the railways. I agree with what is stated by the member for Bruce. I have been looking through the figures relat- ing to the railways in the Financial Statement. But the Railways Department audits its own accounts. It has supreme control of its own finance, and positively the only place where honourable members can obtain any informa- tion in connection with the railways expendi- ture is found in the half-page of the estimates at the end of the Working Railways Account. We are asked to accept blindly the whole of the railway figures without having any document whatever placed in our hands by which to test the accuracy of the Railway Department's figures. Now, Sir, there is another very im- portant point. Some weeks ago the Minister for Railways, in answer to a question by myself, stated that he intended to include in the Rail- ways Statement this year a return showing the amount that was provided by the different Go- vernment departments towards the Railways revenue. The honourable gentleman gave that assurance ; and I venture to say, Sir, that the revenue that has been received by the Railways Department from the other departments of the public service will constitute a very valuable side-light upon the increase in the revenue that the Railways Department claims to have obtained this year. And how can honourable members accurately gauge whether the railways are earning the sum claimed without having the complete figures? And there is another thing, and it is this: The Railways Department last year received a vote of some $600,000 for additions to open lines. How can we, without the Railways Statement, ascertain how much of that money is being spent in actual additions to open lines, and how much may have been -- I do not say is - charged to working-expenses for renewal and improve- ment of the rolling-stock of the railways ? I therefore say it is unfair to the House to ask us to go on with the financial debate without these returns being placed before honourable members. Now, with regard to B .- 1 : The other day, speaking in the House, the Right Hon. the Premier said that B .- 1 could not be provided- Mr. SEDDON .- I object to anything that has taken place in the House being brought up 
<page:626>
member must not transgress that rule. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- I will not refer to a previous debate, but I will say that honourable members have understood that the B .- 1 return could not be laid before this House because there is a block in the Treasury and in the Printing Office. Now, Sir, the prevention of this return being laid before the House must rest either in the one place or the other ; it can- not be in both. If the B .- 1 return has been prepared by the Treasury and is complete, then the delay must be the fault of the Printing Office. If, on the other hand, the return is not completed and has not by the Treasury been handed over to the Printing Office, then the blame must lie with the Treasury. The real fact is this: that if the Government Printing Office is not able- Sir J. G. WARD .- I did not say the Printing Office was to blame for either the Railway or Postal Reports being delayed. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- I know you did not. If I had been allowed to complete what I wished to say, I would have stated to the House that the Premier said so; but I was not allowed to state that. An Hon. MEMBER .- Why do you 3.30. state it now? Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- Because I want toget it into Hansard. However, what I was going to ask was this: Why is not the Government Printing Office brought up to date so far as appliances are concerned in connection with the getting out the work of the colony? Why are there no linotypes, or monolines, or any of the other modern type-setting machines placed there for the purpose of facilitating the work? I am sure that if the Minister for Railways were to conduct his department on the anti- quated methods that the Government Printing Office is conducted on at the present time, he would never get through the work that is placed on the department : and it is as absurd to say that the Government Printing Office should not be equipped with up-to-date machinery for the purpose of facilitating the work of the country as it would be to say that you are going to run the railways with the antiquated engines of ten or fifteen years ago. I think, myself, it is utterly useless in connection with the financial debate to refer to matters regarding the railways except in the most general and indirect manner. The same remark applies to the lands. Here is the great Department of Lands employing thousands of men in connection with roadwork. What opportunity have we of discussing its finances? None whatever. I consider the Government are acting most unfairly in pre- venting these returns being laid on the table while forcing on the financial debate. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) .- Sir, like other honourable members who have spoken, I re- gretted to hear the unsatisfactory nature of the replies from the Ministerial benches with re- gard to the parliamentary papers that have been asked for. Of course, so far as the Rail- ways and Lands Departments are concerned, we have had explanations, such as they were. We to the visit of the Duke of Cornwall and York. Well, it seems to me that the visit of the Duke is like charity : it covers a multitude of sins- on the part of Ministers. But we have had no explanation with regard to the placing of the most important document of them all-the B .- 1 parliamentary paper-on the table of the House. Sir, the Right Hon. the Treasurer must know it is quite impossible to do justice 1 to the Financial Statement, the discussion on  which commences to-night, without that paper. Mr. SEDDON .- It is an injustice that has happened not only this year. In all previous years it has not been possible to produce the return in time. Mr. MASSEY. - Well, two wrongs do not make one right, and I think if the House were i doing its duty it would adopt the suggestion of  the member for Motueka, and refuse to go on with the financial debate until the returns asked for are supplied.  Mr. SEDDON .- I will give you the estimates on Tuesday night, then. Mr. MASSEY .- Our opportunity comes on the first item, and the honourable gentleman knows it. Then, coming to the question of petitions, I thoroughly indorse what has al- ready been said about the treatment given by Ministers to the recommendations of session.l Committees. One honourable gentleman re- 1 ferred to the question of damage to the pro- ! perty of settlers caused through sparks from \---- railway - engines. Several recommendations were made last year by the Railways Com- mittee to recoup settlers for the loss they had suffered ; but I do not suppose that any one of those recommendations was given effee: to by the Ministry. Sir, there were not only the recommendations of the Railways Com- mittee, for I would remind the Minister that bis department appointed a Commissioner to in- quire into the question of damage to property Tha: through sparks from railway-engines. Commissioner travelled from one end of the colony to the other, putting the colony to a lot of expense. I am not blaming the Commis- sioner ; I believe he did his duty, and did it well. He inquired exhaustively into every case submitted to him. So far as my own distriet is concerned, I know that in the case of one settler, who had suffered damage through the railway-engines, the Commissioner went out to the farm and saw for himself the damage the fires had caused ; and in his report he says of one fire that he is of opinion it was caused by the railway-engine, and he recommended that a certain amount by way of compensation should be paid to the settler concerned. Has that 1 compensation been paid ? Not a single silling of it. I am given to understand that when the Minister for Railways was in Auckland on the last occasion he was interviewed by the settler, and he promised that the matter would be re- considered, and that in all probability a sum would be placed on the estimates to give effect to the recommendation of the Commissioner. I hope that is so. If he made a promise I think the amount that is claimed-it is not a large 
<page:627>
amount-will be paid to the gentleman re- | petition of Mr. Reynolds, who got the spark in ferred to. Sir J. G. WARD. - What case was that ? Mr. MASSEY .- I am referring to the case of Mr. James Wallace, of Papatoitoi. Mr. Wallace had twenty-eight fires on his farm in one season, all caused by the railway-engines. Last season being wet, there were no fires. This colony is not the only one in which farmers suffer through railway fires, and I was pleased to notice that last year the Imperial Parliament passed a law making the railway companies liable for damage caused by fires that were started by sparks from the railway-engines. In this colony the Railway Department is, unfor- tunately, not liable, and it is my opinion that until the liability is placed upon them these fires will continue, and that as soon as we make the department responsible the fires will cease. Sir J. G. WARD .- We have the best appli- ances on our engines in the world at the present time. Mr. MASSEY .- That may be, but the fact remains that fires are continually occurring in the dry weather of the summer months. Now I wish to refer to a petition that was considered the other day by the Railways Committee. believe it has been reported on, and therefore I am justitied in referring to it. It was a petition by Mrs. Laurie, of Newmarket, Auckland, who prayed for a compassionate allowance on account of the death of her husband, who a few months ago was killed by an accident. The Railways Department, I believe, have al- ready paid Mrs. Laurie $50. Now, what would have been the position if it had been the case of a private employer? The private employer would have been liable under the Workers' Compensation Act for the payment of $400 to the widow. But. unfortunately, the Railways Department is exempt from the operation of that Act, and consequently Mrs. Laurie had to go down on her knees and apply to Parliament for a reasonable compassionate allowance. I hope, Sir, she will not apply in vain. I come back now to the returns. I want to remind the Premier that a num- ber of returns have, on my motion, been ordered by Parliament this session, and so far not one of them has been laid on the table. I will also take this opportunity of reminding the Premier that when the last Imprest Supply Bill was before the House I referred to a return with reference to the travellin (-expenses of Ministers. That return has not yet been laid on the table of the House. I simply wish to remind the Premier of the fact, though I quite recognise that my reminding him of it will have no effect. Mr. SEDDON .- I will give it to you in ten minutes. Mr. MASSEY .- Well, I hope so. At any rate, the fact remains that less information has been supplied to Parliament this session than has ever been supplied to the House in any previous year. Mr. R. MCKENZIE (Motueka) .- Sir, I wish to explain to the House that, in relation to the his eye in Christchurch, the sum of $50 was granted on a petition, and not by the depart- ment. The Minister for Railways explained the position, and I recollect now that the amount Was recommended by the Railways Committee last session. I at that time had considerable doubt as to the moral obligation of the colony in this case. I thought he ought to have looked after his own eve. Mr. MILLAR (Dunedin City) .- Sir, I desire to say a word or two in connection with some of the returns that should have been presented to the House. Like previous speakers, I am of opinion that it is not fair to ask members to criticize the Financial Statement until the fullest information has been afforded them. Even with that information it is pretty hard to get at what you might call the true position of the finances; and members are now being placed in the position of having to go through that Statement without these very necessary returns to assist them. The result is that they will make certain assertions based on what they believe to be the true position, and Ministers, having at their disposal the information which is now denied to the House, are able toreply and I show where we have made mistakes. That is not fair. We have now been forced into this position : that the criticism of the Government policy, instead of taking place on the floor of the House will have to take place on the public platform, because it is only after the House adjourns that we shall be placed in possession of all the information that will enable us to come to a true conclusion. Sir J. G. WARD. - So will the Ministers use the platform wherever necessary. Mr. MILLAR .- As for the Ministers' criti- cism. I have heard Ministers say on the floor of this House, "Give a statement a twenty- four hours start and you cannot overtake it." No man who has a spark of principle in him would allow himself to be misrepresented or put in a false position by Ministers when such position has been created through Ministers withholding information which could and ought to be given to members, who are equally entitled with Ministers to know them. On the 10th July this House ordered that a return should be laid on the table in connec- tion with the San Francisco mail - service. Surely that is not a return that will affect the Government in any way; and, notwith- standing the fact that we have this large question involving a considerable amount of money coming up for discussion, the return has not yet been presented to the House. All that is asked for is information as to what about the cost is to the colony ; and. although the department has had from the 10th July to the 23rd August, the return is not yet available. One day should have been sufficient to obtain the information, for all that is required is a reference to the steamers' manifests. I would ask, Are we to discuss this service without having that return ? Sir J. G. WARD .- You will have a special opportunity of doing that. 
<page:628>
Mr. MILLAR .- The San Francisco service | port being late. It is only reasonable that the is mentioned in the Statement. Mr. SEDDON .- There is no proposal in the Statement ; we said that we would bring down separate proposais. Mr. MILLAR .- Will the return be presented before these proposals come down ? Mr. SEDDON .- Most decidedly. Mr. MILLAR .- If the service is for the good of the colony, by all means let us have the information. As for the return B .- 1, it enables us to ascertain whether the Government has been spending moneys in the way authorised, and, in the absence of it, I do not feel inclined myself to speak on the Financial Statement at ali. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- The proper time to debate this matter would have been when the next motion to go into Supply was on ; but, to prevent debate when Supply comes on, I would now like to say in reference to B .- 1, about which so much has been said, that the par- ticulars contained in that paper are already before honourable members, but not in the same concise form. It would save them a little trouble if B .- 1 were available- that is all. That being the case, I think a complete answer has been given to the statements made with regard to this return. We have been told that honourable members cannot debate the Financial Statement unless they have B .- 1. If that is so, then there has never been a Financial Statement, excepting one, properly debated in this colony, because it is on record that only on one occasion was B .- 1 on the table of the House before the Financial State- ment. Therefore all financial debates in the past have been failures and farces, because B .- 1 was not available to honourable members.     So much for the contention on that head. Then, as to the Railway returns, my worthy colleague has said that the visit of their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York was to some extent responsible for the delay in presenting it, and there was no doubt that the Midland Railway Commission was more respon- sible for the delay than anything else. The reason for that is that Mr. Hudson. the man who had more to do with the preparing that statement than any one else, was, up to within a few days of the session, with the Commission. After that he left the colony, and a new man had to take up his work. That is the cause of the delay, and I say that is a reasonable explanation, which no member can gainsay. After all, it is only a week later in being pre- sented than last year's. There is no wish on the part of the Government to withhold it, but we cannot do impossibilities ; the Railways Depart- ment is one of the best-managed departments that we have. The General Manager and the whole of the department are most desirous of giving the fullest information possible, but, owing to the circumstances of Mr. Hudson being with the Midland Railway Commission, some little delay had to take place. His services with that Commission will be ad- mitted to be of good value to the colony, which will more than compensate for that re- incoming Assistant Manager would require some little time to make himself acquainted with his new work before he could complete the return. As regards the Railways Report, it will be on the table of the House before the Railway estimates come up for discussion, and I think that is only fair; but it does not affect finance much, for railway expenditure is practically under classi- fication. The honourable member for Riccar- ton is always finding mares' nests. He now brings up " A.O.L. -. additions to open lines- $500,000," and wants information about it. Sir, I say that he will have that in the Public Works Statement. It has nothing whatever to do with the question of the general estimates. As regards the Mines return, I can only say, to show the ignorance of some honourable mem- bers again, that the report of the Rivers Com- mission has been lying on the table for weeks. They show great carelessness when they com- plain about not getting returns which are in their pigeon-holes all the time. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- It is the Mines Re- port we want. Mr. SEDDON .- The Mines Report itself has nothing whatever to do with finance, and the honourable member knows that. It contains reports from the Wardens, showing how the mines are being worked, the returns, and the mining prospects, but from a financial aspect that report is not worth a cup of cold water. Then, as regards the Lands return : As far as it is concerned, there is a very large vote connected with lands, but the principal one will be in the public works estimates, where provision is made for roading. The departmental expenditure in the Lands Department is cut down, because the critical items have gone to the Roads Account and to the Roads Department, so that all that this has got to do with the Financial Statement is to the extent of a few pounds for payments to officers in the Lands Department. That is all that can interest members as far as that is concerned. I was somewhat surprised to hear from the honourable member for R.c- carton-and here I would like to say that I am not going to pay much attention to his statements in the future-I say I was astomided to find a labour representative finding fanit with the Government because they have not got the linotype and other up-to-date labour- saving appliances. He argued that if we had these machines returns would be available much sooner than they are at present. I was very much surprised to hear a statement like that coming from a gentleman who profeses sympathy with the working-classes. He wants us to get these labour-saving appliances. and thus put many members of the Typographical Society out of work. Coming from that source. the statement has surprised me very much. It is quite true that the Government have not go: the linotype in the Government Printing Office. We get along there very well without them. and I prefer to go as we are going, and delay a few days the impatience of honourable mom- bers, and find work for men who deserve it. and who do their work well. I am not one of these 
<page:629>
who prefer to make every sacrifice for the sake of saving half a crown. Sir, I do not think there is anything further to reply to. The proper thing to do is to debate the Financial Statement, and not anticipate it by debates on Imprest Supply Bills. I want to say, from in- formation received and from indications that are before me, that I have come to the con- clusion that there was nothing that honourable members expected to get hold of in the Financial Statement, and, as honourable members have not been able to discover anything there out of which to make capital against the Government, they say, "Oh, well, in the absence of these papers we cannot debate it." I will take that excuse and accept that apology, and take it as a big compliment to the Government in respect to the Financial Statement. That being the case, I will accept the situation and facilitate busi- ness. If honourable members do not wish to debate the Statement let it be postponed, and we will go on with the estimates on Tuesday night. I do not care about the Financial State- ment being debated. I consider these set de- bates are a waste of time, because really we have to go back to the business of the estimates afterwards. Nothing can be effected by the debate, and there is change of policy. An Hon. MEMBER. - The Opposition have converted you. Mr. SEDDON .- No, I am not converted, because conversion is unnecessary ; but what we have done is to convert the Opposition until they are all Government supporters -- in fact,  there is no Opposition. However, I should not be a bit surprised, notwithstanding the position, if there is an attempt made to debate the State- ment. And I want to see it fully debated. have no objection myself. I say that criticism, if fairly directed and if fair in its incidence, is an assistance to any Administration, and it is an assistance to the Government, and it is an assistance to the people of the colony. There- fore I court the fullest investigation and the fullest criticism. I have never hidden any- thing, and never will endeavour to hide or keep back anything ; but if there is further informa- tion wanted I am prepared to give it. I thought to-day there would be an attempt made to make capital, and that some members would say they were not prepared to go on with the financial debate until the returns of Ministers' travelling expenses were given. I knew that point would come up, and I have got it here. Here are the papers, and I am only waiting and panting for an opportunity to place them on the table. Mr. MONK .- I wish you would give me mine. Mr. SEDDON. - The colony offered the honourable member £40, and he took it. Then he had conscientious scruples, and he handed it over to the local bodies. Mr. MONK .- Is the Premier in order in re- ferring to a past debate ? Mr. SEDDON .- I am not referring to a past debate, but am simply giving an answer to the interjection of the honourable member, who asked me to give him his expenses. Mr. MONK .- No ; I said " return." Mr. SEDDON. - The honourable member said, " Give me mine" ; and I said I gave him $40; and the honourable member would not stick to it, but gave it to the local bodies, and they in turn would, if the money was paid over to the Charitable Aid Board, get a subsidy of €1 for #1 for it, which was giving £80 instead of $40. I shall be very careful about giving him another $40. \\If it is returns he wants, of course, I will give them. What is the return the honourable member wanted ? Mr. MONK .- A return showing the number of petitions last session presented to Parliament. I might say that I have been asked to procure this return, and I think the Premier ought to recognise that whenever inquiries are made of him an answer is expected. We are asked to get certain information, and the people of the colony have no idea how difficult it is to get in- formation out of the Cabinet. Mr. SEDDON .- Then, Sir, I shall have great pleasure in facilitating, as far as I can, the return mentioned by the honourable member. I wish to relieve him of anxiety and from being worried by his constituents. But I want to point out to honourable members that a very large number of returns have been ordered, and work is being delayed because the various staffs in each department are now engaged on the returns, and if members say to the Government, " Very well ; you ought to put on twenty or thirty extra clerks and give us our returns," we will do so. But it means that we must wait until we get the returns done, or else em- ploy extra assistance, and that means extra money to be paid. That would be the case if I we really had to give the returns at once that are ordered by the House this session. We would have to put on twenty or thirty extra clerks. Well, if you want to pay $60 extra a week well and good, and I will put the matter in hand. A lot of work has been got out already, and the pigeon-holes are getting pretty full. Mr. MONK .- You will not allow me to have the return granted. Mr. SEDDON .- The honourable member has been asking me to give him a return that has never been asked for. That is quite a new light thrown on the matter. I understood the honour- able member was alluding to a return that had been ordered and had not been made. That is a different matter. I only carry out the orders of the House, and do not comply with the wishes of honourable members unless it is the proper thing to do. But my present busi- ness is to get the Supply Bill through, because there are a couple of Bills here that are of im- portance. At all events, the honourable mem- ber for the Bay of Plenty knows that they are of importance. The motion now is to go into Committee on the Bill; and the next motion is to go into Supply. When Supply comes up I hope we shall not have a long debate, and that we shall get on with the work. Motion agreed to. On the motion to go into Committee of Supply, 
<page:630>
Mr. FISHER ( Wellington City) said,-I beg to move, as an amendment, That, in the opinion of this House, the order given by the Minister in charge of the Government Printing Office, directing the Government Printer not to issue reports of members' speeches from Hansard, is an infringement of the rights and privileges of members of this House. The discussion of this amerdment need not take long, and need not impede the passing of the Imprest Supply Bill. It would not have been necessary to in- tercept Supply had the honourable gentleman gone on with the notices of motion from day to day in accordance with the Standing Orders. The question involved in the amend- 4.0. ment is of great importance to every member of this House, and I may say, without exaggeration, that it is of especial importance to me. The newspapers in this city behave very unfairly to certain members of the House in regard to the reports of public meetings and their comments upon public men. Mr. SEDDON (Premier). - Sir, I am sorry to interrupt the honourable member, but I am of opinion that this same question is upon the Order Paper. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .-- The honourable member cannot move the same motion on going into Supply that is on the Order Paper for a par- ticular dav. Mr. FISHER .- Well, it so happens that it is on the Order Paper for Tuesday next, but it has been on the Order Paper for a month past. What would the Premier recommend me to do ? Mr. HALL-JONES (Minister in Charge of the Printing Office). - The honourable gentle- man asks what he should be advised to do. Well, I have not the slightest desire to interfere with the privileges and rights of honourable members, but it seems to me the proper course would be to bring this matter up at the Re- porting Debates Committee, take the advice of the Committee on the question, and let the Committee bring down its recommendation to the House. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston) .- I should like to point out to the Minister that already this session the Government Printing Office has printed one member's speech, which has been circulated. Mr. HALL-JONES .- I am not aware of it. Mr. PIRANI .- I happen to be a printer, and, although there is an imprint not of the Govern- ment l'rinting Office but of some other printing- office, the type is the type of the Government Printing Office, and a comparison of the type with the Hansard report will show that it is exactly the same type as is used in Hansard. Mr. FISHER .- If I saw it I could tell in a minute. Mr. PIRANI .- Well, it is so; I have not been twenty-seven years in printing - offices without knowing that. It is an extraordinary thing that several members who wished to have their speeches on the Stoke School question printed last year were the first to be blocked by the Government Printing Office from having them printed. Now, there may be something in the argument that the Government Printer is not going to circulate libels, but if he is going to judge whether members' speeches are libellous or not, then let him judge, but not bar every member's speech because some are libellous. An Hon. MEMBER .- Who is to be the judge ? Mr. PIRANI .- I say the Government Printer ought to be the judge. An ordinary printer has to take the responsibility, and why should not the Government Printer do so? But it is ridi- culous to say that members' speeches are libel- lous as a rule. Nothing of the sort is the case; the libels are exceptional. We know, as a matter of fact, the excuse is that there was a threat of libel against a member of the House if his speech was published ; but it was only a threat. Surely, every time the Government Printer is threatened. that is not going to in- terfere with the whole course of work. That is ridiculous. Mr. HALL - JONES. -- What speech was circulated ? Mr. PIRANI .- I was nearly " had " verter- day, and I am not going to be caught again. I will tell the honourable member privately. if he wants to know. It has been urged as a reason why this should not be done that members can get their speeches printed privately and circu- lated. But the Minister must recognise that, by getting the speeches printed by the Govern- ment Printer as extracts from Hansard, there is a guarantee that they are extraets, and that nothing has been interpolated ; but. if you should get any particular speech printed pri- vately, it does not follow that it is an exact copy of the speech at all. Mr. FISHER .- I hope it is understood that I am in possession of the Chair. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER. - That is \~. Mr. HALL-JONES .- Would the honourable member allow me to say to the honourable member for Palmerston that I think there  must be some mistake in what he says ? If it is correct that a speech has been printed in the Government Printing Offee since the in tric- tions were given, then the officer who has dep that will not long remain connected with the Government Printing Ofhere. I shall be glad to have from the honourable member some fur- ther information on the matter. I quite re- cognise his position in not giving the name to the House, but having made that statement. which will be published in Hausand. I think he should go further and give me any informa- tion which will assist me in investigating the matter. I should like to say that I have no feeling on this subject of reprints of members' speeches, but that I recognise that a certain amount of responsibility is cast upon me. If the honourable member does not see his way to bring up the matter before the Reporting Debates Committee, then, if the House approve».  let Mr. Speaker say whether or not any par- ticular speeches are or are not to be printed-I will be satisfied ; but if there is to be an officer to act as censor it should not be the Govern- ment Printer : the Speaker is the guardian of the privileges of Parliament. Or let the Re- porting Debates Committee come to some re- commendation and I am prepared to accept it. \--- \- 
<page:631>
I have no feeling in the matter, but would go on in the ordinary way. With regard to the time when the printing of these reports was stopped, I suppose the debates referred to came on im- mediately after the matter had been first brought under my notice. Well, I think the honourable member will admit that I was right in stopping the printing of speeches when I had high legal authority, no less than that of . the late Solicitor-General, Mr. Reid, who ad- vised me as to what the position was. I should not have been justified without some distinct authority in allowing this eclony to drift into actions for damages, the cost of which would fall upon the taxpayers of the colony. Mr. PIRANI .- Whose speech was it ? Mr. HALL-JONES .- I shall not sav, but I say let the question be decided by the Reporting Debates Committee. Mr. FISHER .- I will answer the honourable member for Avon, who asks whose speech it It was my speech. The speech of the was. Minister for Public Works, who is the Minister in charge of the Printing Office, is what the Americans call "piffle," or "mush." The honourable gentleman has not given one solid reason why the right exercised by members of this House to my knowledge for thirty years past should be taken away from them. As to referring the matter to the Reporting Debates Committee, or to the Speaker, as the member for Palmerston says, why should the speech of a member who delivers a speech on, say, a Local Government Bill be referred to the  Speaker, or to the Reporting Debates Com- mittee? It is only in case of an exceptional speech. I suppose my speeches would be regarded as exceptional speeches which would have to be referred to the Speaker or the Committee. They are too strong in fibre -the pabulum is too strong-for members like the honourable member for Avon. They are not made for men of his physique. But why has the Government taken from the members of this House the right to have their speeches printed at the Government Printing Office from the Hansard type? Here is the ridiculous suggestion of the Minister for Public Works. It is his pet way out of the difficulty. According to the opinion of his lawyer, who he now tells us for the first time is the late Solici- tor-General, it is not libellous if you print, not your own speech, but the whole number of Hansard. Now. I hold in my hand one number of Hansard, containing 122 pages. I have, say, a speech which occupies eight pages in that number. I want ten thou- sand copies of those eight pages only, and I am to print the entire number, containing 122 pages, with the whole of the proceedings of the Legislative Council as well as those of the House, in order that my constituents may get those eight pages. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .-- I rise to a point of order. I have already risen to a point of order, and understood you to rule that this could not proceed ; but the honourable gentleman has achieved his object so far. I think, myself, that the House should declare that members' speeches should be printed, and the Govern- ment and the department should be absolved from the risk. If the House will do that, I will give the opportunity of carrying the reso- lution. Mr. T. MACKENZIE (Waihemo) .- Will you support that ? Mr. SEDDON .- Yes. Mr. FISHER .- I will accept that. Mr. SEDDON .- The honourable gentleman has achieved his object. Let the House pass a resolution to absolve the Government of all liability. I think the Government should be so absolved, and that members' speeches should be printed separately or otherwise as they may desire. Mr. FISHER .- That is all I ask. That is enough for me : I want the privilege of having my speeches printed at the Government Print- ing Office. It is the only chance I have of getting my speeches printed, and I want to preserve that right. The honourable gentle- man in charge of the Printing Department said he could not allow the Government Printer to print them because of the risk of libel. Mr. HALL-JONES. - In accordance with legal opinion. Mr. FISHER .- The honourable gentleman, I understand, received a letter from a lawyer threatening to institute an action for libel. Is that so ? Mr. HALL-JONES .- No. Mr. PIRANI. - It was only a newspaper para- graph. Mr. FISHER .- Is that all ? Well, let me tell the honourable gentleman and the House that I received a letter threatening me with an action for libel in consequence of the printing and publishing of a speech. I tore up the letter and threw it into the waste-paper basket, and I have heard nothing more of the matter since. Yet here is the representative of the Government frightened because he has received a lawyer's letter ; and because he holds a legal opinion on the law of libel every member of the House is to be denied the right to speak to his constituents through the printing of his speeches at the Government Printing Office. Mr. SEDDON .- Oh, it is all right. Mr. FISHER. -- If the Premier, before the session is over, will give the House an oppor- tunity to pass a resolution saying we should have the right to print our speeches, but absolving the Government Printer from respon- sibility or risk so long as the person who makes the speech accepts the responsibility, that is all I wish. I will take all the responsibility, and as many lawyer's letters as they choose to send along. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- I will solve the difficulty at once. I ask my colleague to move a resolution that this House authorises the printing of members' speeches as usual. There is a motion which can be put in two minutes, and the whole thing is done. Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) .- 1 will move, That, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable that members' speeches should be reprinted as heretofore. 
<page:632>
In doing so I say that I have no feeling in the matter, or no desire to prevent any member's speech from being printed. It is certainly a great convenience, and the only reason for the position I took up was that I was advised on a. legal authority of high standing that in certain cases the Government Printer was liable to an action for damages. With a resolution of this House approving of the issue of speeches, I am quite prepared, immediately the House passes the resolution, to give instructions to the Government Printer to print them as before. Mr. BARCLAY (Dunedin City) .- I shall not detain the House more than a minute. I wish to say that, so far as I can judge, the resolution proposed would have no effect on the law ; no resolution of the House can effect the law : any alteration must be by statute. If the Minister chooses to authorise the printing of speeches after the resolution is passed, the liability still remains with the Government and the depart- ment. That is not desirable. What ought to be done is that a short Act should be intro- duced, absolving the Printing Office from liability in the matter, but leaving the respon- sibility with the author of the speech. Mr. TANNER (Avon). - I entirely dissent from the views of the last speaker. The honour- able gentleman-the Minister for Public Works -who introduced the resolution, said something to the effect that it should be accompanied by a declaration absolving the parties from blame : but I was glad to hear when the motion was read that speeches were to be printed as before, leaving matters exactly as they were up to last year. I believe that during thirty years which have passed no real offence has been created by the publication of these speeches. I am not aware of a single action that has ever been brought either against the Minister in charge of the department or the Government Printer, or against any member of the House, in con- sequence of the printing and circulation of speeches through the medium of the Govern- ment Printing Office, nor do I think it likely that anything of the kind may be anticipated. Therefore I shall support the motion as read from the Chair. But I dissent from the pro- posal to introduce any legislation on the sub- ject which should absolve any one from the blame which might rightly attach to the pub- lication of any such speech. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton) .- Sir, I entirely agree with the Government in the action they propose to take in permitting the reprinting of the speeches of members in con- nection with the proceedings in the House. Honourable members will remember that this privilege was always granted until last year, and that that privilege was suddenly withdrawn when a discussion was taking place in the House relating to a particular institution at Nelson. Now, it is no use to beat about the bush. It suited the Premier on that occasion, for some purpose of his own, to try and prevent the dis- semination of the speeches of members in re- gard to that particular institution. Mr. SEDDON .- I had nothing to do with it. Mr. Hall-Jones Mr. G. W. RUSSELL. - The honourable gentleman states he had nothing to do with it. Well, a statement of that kind must be ac- cepted; but, as the honourable gentleman him- self said the other night, we should take it cum grano salis, and with a very large grano indeed. Now, I think that these speeches should be set by the linotypes. What possible ground can there be for the Government of this country, in one of its institutions, employing only the mechanical means that have been employed for the last hundred or hundred and fifty years, while there are machines in existence in every office of the country-that is, of any standing -where this class of work can be done for about one-fourth of the cost that the Government are paying ? Mr. HALL-JONES .- They will be wiped out soon by better machines. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- That is not the excuse the Premier gives. The Premier's excuse is that the Government Printing Office should be treated as an institution for the pur- pose of maintaining in employment men who would be thrown on the labour-market but for that circumstance. What is the fact ? Why, that with the linotype type can be set at 4d. per thousand. The Government are paying at the present time Is. 4d. for exactly the same work. That is the position. Then when a member, representing the general interests of the colony, and desiring to see economy practised, advocates reform and economy in a matter of this kind, the Premier will get up directly and make another characteristic speech denouncing him for wanting to throw thex men out of employment. Sir, I venture to say that it was an unconstitutional act on the part of the Government to withdraw the privilege from members of the House a year ago of having their speeches reprinted, and now they com. down and say they are going to give us that privilege again. If they took it away a year or so back for sound and valid reasons. why are they going to give it back to us now ? And if they can give it back to members now, why did they withdraw that right twelve months ago? Has the law of libel been altered? I know of no alteration. Has there been any alteration in connection with the responsibility of the Government and the responsibility of the Government Printer now as compared with what it was a year ago ? Certainly not. The Government have simply performed the usual "jump Jim Crow" business, taking away this right last year, and, without any change in the conditions, giving it back again. As for the re- marks of the honourable member for Dunedin City (Mr. Barclay), who has dwelt on the aspect of the libel law, they are to be taken as the re- marks of a person who has very little practical knowledge of the subject on which he presumed to lecture the House. He insists on every pos- sible occasion on airing opinions on law which have no force whatever, and, in fact, they are the subject of absolute ridicule in this House. That is the position the honourable gentleman occupies, and therefore any statements he may make have simply to be disregarded, even ou \- 
<page:633>
the question with respect to which he is sup- posed to be an expert-namely, law. Mr. HOGG (Masterton) .- I think the ques- tion that has been raised this afternoon is a somewhat important one. Notwithstanding the abuse which has just been levelled by the honourable member for Riccarton at my col- league Mr. Barclay, the honourable member for Dunedin City, the fact remains that he is always ready to give the House. the benefit of his opinion as an expert on constitutional law and practice. The sug- gestion he has made will be of value if it en- ables us to avoid bringing Parliament into disrepute, and perhaps involving the country in a considerable amount of expense. I assume that it is the duty of this House to protect the country against running the risk of actions of law for heavy damages. What has the member for Riccarton just been doing ? For the second time this afternoon he is figuring conspicu- ously as the advocate of cheap labour. What compassion has he for the workers in the Government Printing Office, some of whom for many years have done valuable service for the colony-men who are probably his equal in intelligence and in every other re- spect ? His advice is that these men, most of them with families depending on them, should be turned out of their employment at once, simply because certain machinery has been invented by means of which their labour may be superseded. Is that protecting the labouring-classes of this country? I have no  doubt, Sir, when he appears on the platform he is addicted to telling the working-men that he admires them, and that he has their interests and prosperity at heart. Now, Sir, what are the Government doing by maintaining these men in their positions and refusing to introduce the linotype? Simply what considerate em- ployers would do under similar circumstances. We have, I believe, men in the printing trade now that have the means and the opportunity of introducing the linotype, but who decline to do so out of consideration for the men who have so long been employed under them. You cannot blame any employer for taking advantage of improved machinery, and endea- vouring to get his work done as cheaply as possible ; but I admire the employer who, before he introduces labour - saving machinery into his office, endeavours to minimise suffering by finding employment for the hands who are to be displaced, or allows them by a natural and inevitable process to disappear. But the honourable gentleman wants to clear them out at very short notice. He suggests that work- ing men should be suddenly and arbitrarily deprived of their employment because ma- chinery has been discovered by which their labour can be superseded. I trust there are few gentlemen in this House who have not a little more ordinary consideration for their fellows. Travelling from this subject to per- haps an equally important aspect of the matter we are debating, we know very well how members are privileged in this House. Under cover of this privilege do we not occa- sionally find certain members making state- ments regarding their fellow-men that they would hardly venture to make on the plat- form or outside this House? We have not carried that freedom of privilege so far or abused it to such an extent as they have in other colonies, where most objectionable lan- guage is sometimes used. Still, utterances of a most libellous and defamatory kind can be used in this House, and the member who takes that course is protected from the consequences. Now, are such statements to be circulated through the medium of the Government Print- ing Office throughout the colony? If they are to be circulated in this way, and the Go- vernment Printer is no longer a free agent, in what position will the colony be placed ? With the involuntary assistance of the Govern- ment Printer, any person may be libelled and traduced by any member of this House. Now and again an unscrupulous individual may manage to find his way to this Chamber, and if the Government Printer is compelled to cir- culate his utterances what is likely to happen ? If the persons libelled seek their remedy at law we know what almost invariably happens. When the party prosecuted is the Government Printer, or the Government of the country, or any corporation that is supposed to represent wealth, they generally come off second best. If damages are awarded they are made to suffer heavily. Will the transgressor be made to suffer? No ; it is the country and the general body of taxpayers. Before we deal finally with this question we must remember that it is not the Government Printer whose interests are chiefly at stake, but the interests of the country, and of the people who have to find the money. The honourable member for Dun- edin City was perfectly right in submitting that, before seeking a privilege of the kind, and throwing on the Government Printer the re- sponsibility of printing the libellous statements that may be made in the House, we ought to provide that the Government Printer shall not be responsible for the utterances he may have to print. We ought to see that the country is protected in this matter, and that the taxpayers are not compelled to pay heavy damages. Mr. T. MACKENZIE (Waihemo) .- 4.30. The honourable gentleman has. I think, taken a rather personal view of the matter. He enjoys a privilege which the honourable mem- ber for Wellington City does not enjoy. He has a newspaper of his own, in which he can circu- lato all his speeches. Mr. HOGG .- No. Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- There is a newspaper to which the honourable gentleman can send all his speeches, and so is able to reach his constitu- ents, and I say that is a very important matter. That is why he can pose in the House as a man who does not require this convenience. But there are members in this House who have not such means of reaching their constituents ; and it is not to be expected that newspapers have the space to grant members, and give them that full information regarding their public actions 
<page:634>
that members desire and that the constituents would like to see. I therefore think it is of the first importance that members should enjoy, by paying for it, the privilege of obtaining copies of their speeches and circulating them throughout the districts. I think the more their constituents know of the work of a member the better they are able to gauge him, whether he is doing right or whether he is doing wrong, and the report then is not liable to party newspaper colourings. A peculiar attempt is now being made in this country to create a feeling that Parliament is not the proper piace to air abuses -- that.a man must be prepared to go outside Parliament, and state outside Parliament what he considers necessary, when he exposes matters in the interests of the public. Now, that is contrary to all established precedent. 1 maintain that Parliament is the platform from which the grievances of the country should be made known, and unless we enjoy and preserve that privilege and fully exercise it, then, I say, good- bye to the liberty and freedom and advance- ment of the privileges of the people of the country. The honourable member for Welling. ton City states that he has threats of libel. Why, since I was returned to this House last year I have had threats of no less than six libel actions. But, Sir. the singular thing in con- nection with these is that there have been publications outside the House made by me precisely similar to what I made inside : but the people content themselves with threats. They want, by threatening, to give people the impression they are right, and thus they hope to  satisfy the public in a measure : but they have no case to go on with, and they know it. But even assuming they had a case to go on with, because " the greater the truth the greater the libel," does it follow that if a member of this House, in his conscientious endeavours to serve the best interests of his country, makes a statement which may bring him within the scope of some moneyed institution, he should expose himself and his family and his means to an attack in this manner ? Is the object of his statement the injury of individuals or the benefit of the wider interests of the whole colony ? If it is for the benefit of the whole colony, and not for the injury of individuals- although individuals may be an incident in the situation, and may suffer, the latter is not his object -I say if his object is the welfare of the community. then the House of Parliament is the place to state the grievance. Sir, I wish now to refer to the trouble in connection with the Dunedin Hospital. We have the Trustees of that institution declaring that it is unbecoming of a member of Parliament, from his position in Parliament, to make a statement regarding the management of the Dunedin Hospital. Sir, I have just this moment received a letter from Dunedin thanking me for having had the courage to make the statement detailing the neglect. It is all very well for honourable members always to try and run smoothly with the tide, but, if an honourable member knows within his own experience that certain ill-treat- ment has occurred towards a poor patient in one Mr. T. Mackenzie of our hospitals, it is his duty to fearlessly make that statement on the floor of this House, in order that that institution may rectify the errors It does not necessarily that may have arisen. follow that the institution is badly managed. but these ills must be pointed out. And in con- nection with this, Sir, we have the Chairman and authorities of that Hospital declaring that he and they can give to the whole statement what he calls a circumstantial and direct denial. Why, how can the Chairman of that institu- tion give a direct denial to an incident he did not witness ? And, if he does give a direct denial, does he think that his word will be taken before mine by the people of Otago and the people of New Zealand ? He will find my public record is too well known for that. Can he show that I had any personal interest in making known the sufferings of my friend John Mackenzie, who was injured there through not being afforded on a certain occasion the conveniences which he ought to have had? The mere statement of denial will never alter the fact, and never delete from the public mind the statement that I say that man suffered there, and he had not that which he ought to have had within his reach. That is the point. And let me say too, I have been told that this is a matter which should have been brought before the Trustees themselves. I explained to this House that I promised this dying man that until after his death the matter would not be brought out. And. Sir, before he died I was on the Teachers' Commission. But let me say in this connection that there was under the same department in the North Island something very serious going on, and I did appeal to the department, and the department denied the existence of it ; and it was not until I brought this matter before this House that the depart- ment then acknowledged what I said was abo lutely true. And if matters are brought on the floor of this House as they ought to be they have got a marvellous effect. A deliverance from the Parliament of New Zealand matis Bumbledom sit up. It makes these men recognise that there is a voice which can te heard, and it reaches to every section of the community, and which cannot be resisted, and hence the fever of the Dunedin Hospital Tras- tees. They now demand what they call a Magisterial inquiry ; and then, as if fearing i: will not be granted, they at once say, if this Magisterial inquiry is refused by the Govern- ment. they shall themselves apply for a Com- mission to be set up, with men selected by themselves. I say, let them get a Magisterial inquiry, and I shall be only too glad to go and state what I said in connection with it. Suffi- cient has already been made clear that the staff nurses and Trustees will stand shoulder to shoulder for the institution against Thomas Mackenzie, but they will get exactly the same plain story told to them before the investigation that I told upon the floor of this House. I have no number of witnesses ; the circumstances are quite plain. I went there and I saw this man suffering, and certain things which ought to have been there were not there. The nurse came along 
<page:635>
and said I should not take notice of what the man said. I pointed out what was required. She said, " The absence arose because the doctor did not like certain things there." I then had to go to an important meeting, and went out of Dunedin next morning, but I wired to a friend of mine to see the doctor in attendance. The doctor in attendance was indignant that he should have been interfered with, and resented the interference. Now, can a continuous cir- cumstantial story like that be upset by the mere denial of the Chairman of the institution, who never was present, and never witnessed it. Mr. ARNOLD .- What about the food ? Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- I did not say any thing about the food in my speech in the House, but I did point out to my friend that I thought this patient ought to get a few more delicacies, and asked him to represent that also to Dr. Macpherson. And let me say too, on behalf of the institution, that after Mr. Roderick Mckenzie saw Dr. Macpherson the conditions very materially improved, and I should say that the fear which the patient expressed to me that he would be worse treated if made known was a fear I do not think he was justified in making. One great reason why I have brought this matter up is because of the conduct of the doctor to that dying man. After he was told he was suffering, the doctor went to him and bullied him, and declared he had no right to mention to any man the conditions under which he was placed. Sir, I remember visiting the late Sir John MeKenzie, who suffered from a bladder complaint like my friend, and I remember telling him and Lady Mckenzie the circumstances, and they said they could feel, and feel deeply, for that unfortunate man,   placed in those unfortunate circumstances, and Sir John expressed the hope that I would not let it pass. I say, therefore, that those men who consider first of all that Parliament is not the place to ventilate grievances are endea- vouring to infringe upon the rights of Parlia- ment. And it is the duty of members of this House to fearlessly state these things, even if it is unpopular to attack some of these strong institutions. I have shown my friend the member for Dunedin City the notes which I took of the events as they occurred, so that he is perfectly familiar with the case, and I think he will confess that they are ar- ranged in a manner to indicate that something must have occurred which justified me in writing the notes on that subject and occasion. I say, then, we have a right to come here and explain any abuses. Some people are always threatening libel actions, and I think it is a pity they do not bring them on. They would find they would be frustrated. I have myself been threatened with libel actions for what I have stated in this House with regard to the dis- honest practices that are going on in connection with the meat trade. Last year Mr. Weymouth, manager of the Belfast Meat-freezing Works, in Canterbury, said my remarks could not remain unanswered. I stated that his grade for large parcels and the prices of his best brand were not so high as those of another factory, and that was the answer he made. In his letter he states :- " As your statements are being freely can- vassed and discussed in Canterbury, you will see that in justice to ourselves we cannot allow them to remain long unanswered, and I trust, therefore, that you will endeavour to supply data as soon as possible." Sir, I have made much more serious charges in this House since; and what reply has he made? After waiting for three or four weeks he puts in the feeblest possible reply. He does not deny one single allegation, but merely states that they are going on grading their meat, and are able to sell the meat on the c.i.f. certifi- cate. Then my friend the member for Ashley attacks the reply that was made by the freezing company, and says in a plain way, " Let us get from you a plain statement of fact. Did Mr. Mackenzie tell the truth regarding the frozen- meat industry, or did he not ? That is what the farmers of the country want to know. We do not want to know whether you are continuing to freeze so many hundreds of thousands of sheep, or whether Mr. Mackenzie has some particular grievance against you. We want to know whether the truth has been told or not." Now, I will tell the House what I have done. I have attacked four or five of the most powerful interests. I have attacked the asses- sors ; I have attacked the insurance companies, because of their neglect in connection with the trade ; and I have attacked the meat salesmen, the shipping companies, and the grading of the country ; and what the manager of the Belfast Company is no doubt waiting to do is to get a combination of those interests to work up a combined case, and when he gets them dove- tailed into one he will try and make a case of it. But I challenge him now to deny the state- ment I have made when I said that he slumped as many as a thousand sheep together, ranging from 45 1b. to 80 1b., and I challenge him to show that the highest class of his grading will command, regularly, c.i.f. on the London market, as high a price as the highest Eclipse class of grading of the other meat company in Christchurch. These, Sir. are the main facts. I did not expect to talk at any length when I rose. I simply stood up to say that members have a right to have their speeches printed and circulated. Their remarks ought to be circulated throughout their electorates and throughout the colony, in order that the people may know what their representatives are doing. Mr. MEREDITH (Ashley) .- Sir, I desire for a short time to refer to the question of reprint- ing members' speeches-a question that was brought up by the member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher). On two previous occasions I brought this matter under the notice of the Government, and did not receive a satisfactory reply. Some of the newspapers of the colony took up the matter and wanted to browbeat me for what I had said. Sir, I consider the action I have taken was in the interests not only of the House, but of the country. Sir, I consider it was an unwarrantable interference with the 
<page:636>
rights of members of the House for the Minis- ter in charge of the Government Printing Office to give instructions to the Government Printer to refuse to reprint members' speeches. I have no controversy with the Government Printer. I am not in conflict in any shape or form with that gentleman ; but it seems strange, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Riccarton this afternoon - indeed, it is a very striking circumstance that, simultaneous with the delivery of speeches of members of this House last session of Parliament on the question of the Private Industrial Schools Bill, and im- mediately those speeches were printed, instruc- tions should be given to the Government Printer by the Minister for Public Works that the reprinting of members' speeches was to be dis- continued. I had given an order for two or three hundred copies of my own speech. The proprietor of a newspaper in the Pahiatua district called on me and asked me if he could obtain three or four hundred copies of my speech. I said he could-that as long as he paid for them he could have as many as he pleased. Two days later the Government Printer called on me and informed me that he had received instructions from the Minister in charge that he was to no longer reprint members' speeches. The information came on me as a surprise. When the Minister in charge of the Printing Office replied to my question on the subject during the present ses- sion he said the privilege had been extended by courtesy to members, and had not been granted for many years. Now we have the state- ment of the member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) that for the past thirty years and more that right had been enjoyed by mem- bers of the House. Sir, I am pleased to find that the Minister has acted on the sug- gestion of the Premier. The Hon. the Premier has grasped the situation. He sees the temper of the House, and knows the House will assert itself in regard to its rights, and I think it is time the House did so. I well recollect that, during the session of 1892, when a very im- portant debate was going on in connection with the second reading of the Land Bill, the speeches of Mr. Ballance, then Premier of the colony, the late Sir John Mckenzie, then Minister of Lands, and the Right Hon. Mr. Seddon, then Minister for Public Works, were compiled, and something like eight or ten thousand copies were issued and circulated from the North Cape to the Bluff. For what purpose, Sir? To educate the public. The newspapers could not find space, even if they were willing, to publish the speeches at length, and, consequently, the only way to educate the public was to reprint the speeches and circulate them. Then, again, honourable members will recollect that only a few years ago a speech was delivered in this House by the late Sir John Mckenzie on the land-for-settlements policy, on which occasion the historic map of the Hororata Estate was embodied in Hansard. Thousands of copies of that speech were printed at the Government printing-works and circulated throughout the Mr. Meredith | length and breadth of the colony. I do not sce any reason why the Minister in charge of the printing-works should attempt to prevent the printing of members' speeches. Last session the honourable gentleman did wrong, and now he has endeavoured to make reparation for that wrong by moving the resolution that I feel sure will be carried by the House. Mr. ATKINSON (Wellington City) .- Sir, I wish to say a word with regard to this motion. I do not think the passing of the motion will in any way solve the difficulty. I can speak quite dispassionately on the subject. although I was one of the first to be aggrieved by the order of the Minister in charge of the Printing Office last session, that the privilege should te withdrawn from members of having reprints si their speeches from that office. The member for Dunedin City (Mr. Barclay) has pointed out. in an argument that has been attacked but in no way impeached, that legally the position will not be altered by the passing of this resolu- tion. The legal position will still remain as it is now if this resolution is carried. The Go- vernment Printer, and, of course, that is the country-the taxpayer-will still remain liable in any action for damages that may be success. fully brought for publishing reprints of aux member's speech. That legal liability will not be altered one iota by passing the resolution. Then, is it a fair thing that the Government Printer-that is to say, the country-should undertake any such liabilitya: all? I am not urging for one moment the cur- tailment of this privilege. I resented it very much that the Minister should suddenly have curtailed it last session, and I still think that the manner in which it was done was highly undesirable, and not at all complimentary to the freedom of this House. I think if he bid taken the House into his confidence then, as & has done this afternoon, he could have throw. the responsibility on the House. I resented it then, and I still think the proper course was not taken. The publication of the particular speech referred to this afternoon called atten- tion to a danger and a liability which were not thought of before, for the simple reason that no circumstances had previously arisen to suggest the danger and the liability. To put the matter in the most striking way I can think of, sup- posing that on account of some private grudge I may have against somebody, whether cn- gaged in the liquor traffic or any other busi- ness that might tend to excite my resentment. I for five or ten minutes indulged in a grossly hibellous speech, and supposing I limited my- self for the five or ten minutes to an attack on that particular individual, I presume according to the privileges that honourable members of this House enjoy I should be entitled to get a reprint of that speech from the Government Printer. Mr. FISHER .- The same as I did with Henry Wright. Mr. ATKINSON .- I do not desire to make the honourable gentleman a model in this respect. nor was I aware that he gloried in tactics thi: no self-respecting member of this House would 
<page:637>
of that kind, is it right that I should be able by republication to make the country liable for damages ? It may be in the public interest that the general privilege of having speeches reprinted should not be curtailed merely be- cause members may now and again abuse it. On the other hand, would it not be a very simple matter to allow the privileges to con- tinue, and at the same time to relieve the (Government Printer and the taxpayer of any liability ? It is a perfectly simple matter, but it cannot be done by a simple resolution. It could, however, be done by a Bill of a couple of clauses; and. although I will not vote against this resolution, because I would prefer to see the privilege continued than to see it taken away altogether ; yet after passing this resolution, removing the responsibility from a member's shoulder and putting it on to the House, I would suggest that it be followed up by a Bill relieving the Government Printer from any responsibility in any action for libel in connection with these reprints. The Printer would then be in the same position with regard to them as in the case of Hansard ; but members, while their remarks in Hansard would be privi- leged, would not be so protected if extracts were made and circulated. The junior member for Wellington City has stated that he was not anxious to avoid any responsibility in this con- nection, and it would follow that he has not the slightest wish to mulet the Government Printer or the taxpayer in the case of any action being brought against the Government Printer and the speaker for publication of such extracts. I think the Minister will therefore see that though we may pass his resolution unanimously he will not have settled the question which gave him such a scare last session, and there might be some hope of passing with the same unanimity a Bill to put the question beyond all doubt. and on a just and equitable footing. Amendment, That, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable that separate reprints of honourable members' speeches reported in Hansard may be printed at the Government Printing Office as hitherto. Agreed to. Motion to go into Committee agreed to, and the House went into Committee of Supply. The Bill was read a first and second 5.0. time. On the motion that the Bill be read a third time, Mr. O'MEARA (Pahiatua) said, There is one item here that I would like an explanation about. It is in the Second Schedule of the Bill, the item $38,500. Will the Hon. the Minister in charge kindly explain what that amount is for ? Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- Sir, the figures are the same as in the last Imprest Supply Bill, but this $33,500 is to meet interest charges on advances to settlers which fall in towards the end of next month. That is the reason why the increase appears here as in the Second Schedule. I think it is only right that the information should be given to honourable members, otherwise they might think, after the schedule had passed through, that it had passed may say the debate on the Bill has been some- what protracted. An. Hon. MEMBER .- No ; very short. Mr. SEDDON .- Well, the debate on going into Supply so as to get at the Bill was very long, but I have no reason to complain. I do not think there has been anything said that is at all unnecessary, and I hope the position is now satisfactory to all concerned, and I be- lieve it is. The only unpleasant feature-a matter which was to be regretted very much- was a remark made by the honourable mem- ber for Riccarton, which I hope, on calm reflection, that honourable member wil iwith- draw. The expression was that those who were employed at the Printing Office were there simply out of charity. I do not think that deserving men, who are honestly earning a living, and who are being paid the ordinary rate of wages, should have such terms applied to them, and applied without the smallest provocation. I think that was entirely wrong. There was no necessity for any reflection of that kind, and the men will naturally feel it, though they are not responsible that the Government will not introduce the linotypes and other improved appliances. I, at all events. think that the State should not be the first to take the opportunity, when we have no competition to meet, of adopting this means of throwing out of work and upon the world a large body of men. As far as I can see, the finances of the colony do not warrant us in doing that. We have practically no competi- tion, and I say that a comparison of our work will show that it is done as well and as reason- ably as the work of any printing firm of the colony. As I have said, the Government de- cided not to introduce these appliances, and neither the country nor members of the House have called upon us to do so. Because, then, we have not decided to introduce these ap- pliances, is it right that these men should be charged with living upon charity? I hope the honourable member will withdraw the remark, which I think must have been made without due reflection. I move the third reading of the Bill. Bill read a third time. # HOSPITAL NURSES REGISTRATION BILL. On the question, That the amendments in this Bil. be agreed to, Mr. HALL-JONES .- When this Bill was in Committee I promised to move for the re- committal, for the purpose of striking out cer- tain words in clause 4, and I therefore move the recommittal of the Bill for the purpose of striking out the words " and unless the matron herself is a certificated nurse." Mr. T. MACKENZIE (Waihemo) .- Sir, on the question of the recommittal of this Bill I want to make a few observations. When the Bill was being read a second time there were certain statements made. For instance, the member for Dunedin City (Mr. Arnold) made this statement regarding myself :- 
<page:638>
"Last session we had what I call a very exaggerated statement with regard to the har- bour, and I certainly expected that it would have been taken notice of by the Harbour Board before now ; and not many days ago, in this House, we had a severe statement made by him with regard to the Municipal Council in connection with their management of and the state of the Water of Leith. Such a state- ment should be treated with the contempt it deserves both by the Council and the members for the city." Then, again, he says,- " I refer to this matter now so that I may in the first place lay emphasis upon the state- ment made by the member for Waihemo. If it is found that it is not correct, the authorities in Dunedin can note it, and, I hope, cause the member to be more careful in the future." Sir, first of all, in regard to my statements in connection with the Harbour Board : I ask the honourable member, Mr. Arnold, were my statements true ? He gives no reply. He says he hoped the Harbour Board would take notice of them, and then he continues that my state- ment with regard to the Water of Leith should be treated with the contempt it deserves by members of the House and Councillors. Sir, why should the Harbour Board take notice of my speech and not the City Councillors ? Will the honourable gentleman say that my state- ment with regard to the Water of Leith was in- correct ? I want the honourable gentleman to reply to that, because if he says that my state- ment was incorrect I have evidence here to show that the state of the Water of Leith was as I described it, and the Minister for Railways will also bear me ont in the statement that I wrote to him complaining that the Water of Leith was in a disgraceful condition, and that he communicated with the Dunedin authori- ties, and caused the filthy sewers containing offensive matter to be stopped. An Hon. MEMBER. - I should like to ask the honourable gentleman what this has to do with the amendment of the Hospital Nurses Registra- tion Bill ? Mr. T. MACKENZIE .- I am referring to a speech the honourable gentleman delivered on the second reading of the measure, and am replying to remarks delivered on a speech on this Bill. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- I do not think that would be in order. The question now is the recommittal of two clauses for specific pur- poses, and the discussion must be confined to whether those amendments should be put in or not. Mr. T. MACKENZIE. - The reason why I have taken this opportunity is because I wished to reply at the earliest possible time to the honourable gentleman's remarks, but if you rule me out of order I must submit to your ruling. I would point out that the third reading might not come on for three weeks, owing to the financial debate, and that led me to take advan- tage of the earliest possible opportunity. Bill recommitted. Mr. T. Mackenzie IN COMMITTEE. Clause 4 .- " (1.) Every person who. on the coming into operation of this Act. holds a cer- tificate of three consecutive years' training as a nurse in a hospital, and proves to the satis- faction of the Registrar that during her train- ing she received systematic instruction in theoretical and practical nursing from the medical officer and matron (the matron her- self being a certificated nurse), is entitled to registration on payment of a fee of ten shillings. and on application to the Registrar on or before the thirtieth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and two." Mr. HALL-JONES moved to strike out the words " the matron herself being a certincate nurse." Amendment agreed to. Bill reported. On the question, That the Bill be read ! third time, Mr. T. MACKENZIE (Waihemo) .- I was saving, when I was ruled out of order by the Deputy-Speaker, that I had communicated with the Minister for Railways in connection with the offensive drains in Dunedin whib poured into the Water of Leith, and he t. s the matter in hand and insisted that the mais- ance should cease. Mr. Arnold wished to convey the idea that my statements were wrent- and that they should be treated with the cut- tempt they deserved. I may say I have as great interests in Dunedin as the honourahh member for Dunedin City (Mr. Arnold : and I venture to say it is those who point out the weaknesses in a local body, and assist in ne forming them, who are the best friends of the community, so that by removing defects the: may improve the condition of the city and : health and beauty. During the passage of th. Tramways Bill, by insisting that the beauti !. resorts of Dunedin should not be destroyed. 1 assisted others in endeavouring to preserve the beauty of the place. I consider the man ! io most patriotic who endeavours to secure the health of the community and the beauty of its surroundings, and his remarks in that direct n should be taken in the right light. honourable gentleman said the Council she'd take steps to keep me from exaggerating; to- bably he meant the Council ought to have taken steps to prevent my speaking the truth. thus making things comfortable for then :. However, Mr. Arnold will have ample open- tunity when I sit down to defend his paris1. 3 if he wishes. Now, coming back to the gate- tion of the Hospital Nurses Bill, in connec- tion with what is now contemplated by the Hospital Board : The Chairman of the Board was interviewed by the representatives of the Otago Daily Times and Star. When he was approached he put on what was called a broad smile, and said " This is one of Mr. Thomas Mackenzie's sensations." But when they m: t to consider the matter smiles vanished, and it formed the subject of what they call a heated condemnation. They were visibly moved. and poured forth the vials of their wrath on my poor head. They then demanded an investi- 
<page:639>
judicial body had already stated that the whole matter was untrue. It was surely a peculiar attitude for a public body to take up. They settled the case before hearing the other side. They did not even wait for the copy of Hansard to see what my full remarks were on the sub- ject. They demand from the Government an investigation, declaring the whole thing to be untrue, before they ever heard the case stated. They believe in Jedburgh justice if any one dares to touch their institution. I think any one considering the matter will say they did not show that judicial mind they ought to have in this connection. Then, we have the Chair- man and members of the Board stating that they have received extensive communications regarding the kindness exhibited by the nurses to the patients. I do not deny that they are kind in many instances-in most instances ; but this proves nothing in regard to the case. I have here a whole batch of letters, which I do not intend to read, which assert that their treatment has been unkind to people in the hospital ; but this proves nothing in connection with my case. I maintain that letters relating to either the kindness or neglect on the part of the nurses have not the slightest influence on the case. It must stand alone on its own merits; and in quoting these one would be quoting what has no bearing on the case what- ever. I merely refer to the matter to show that letters come spontaneously from both sides. Then, the Chairman of this body stated that Mr. John Mackenzie, whom he refers to as " this man Mackenzie." was a cantankerous patient. Now, if I had time to quote the obituary notices from the Clutha Leader and the Free Press I could show that he was one of the most kindly and generous of men - one of Nature's gentlemen ; a Highlander who loved his country, and was kind to every one with whom he came in contact-a man greatly be- loved by all. An Hon. MEMBER .- His name would show that. Mr. T. MACKENZIE. - Yes. I believe the motto of one branch of the Mackenzie family is Amore vice-" Conquered by love." When, therefore, the Chairman declared that he was cantankerous, and a disagreeable patient, he stated what was absolutely incorrect ; and if he wishes a judicial inquiry to take place he had no right to prejudice the case or prejudice the public mind previous to the investigation that was to take place: and. in his calmer moments, when his dignity has been soothed, he will probably admit that. The Dunedin Hospital has had investigations before, and it has been shown that faults can occur there: yet. at the beginning of the matter, no doubt, Mr. Millar was quite pre- pared, as in my case, to give it a direct and circumstantial denial -- I think he was the Chairman then. I refer to the case of a Mr. Cusack, a friend of Mr. Sontag's, who some few years ago entered the Dunedin Hospital with a slight injury to his little finger. As his friends had not heard about him they made and buried. His friends, like myself 7.30. perhaps, were unusually troublesome to the trustees and the doctors. They insisted on knowing what the man had died of, and where he was buried. They were told by one doctor that he had died of blood-poisoning, and by another doctor that he had died of throat disease ; and then, when an investigation took place, it was proved that he had died of neither of these complaints. Then, they put questions for the purpose of knowing where the man was buried, but received evasive answers. His friends, however, still kopt annoying these trustees, and finally they discovered that the man had not been buried at all, but that his body had been sent down to the dissecting and lecture-room at the University. Not only did they state what was incorrect, but their action was an evasion of the Anatomy Act. Now, since the dinner adjournment I have got the Otago Daily Times containing a report of the meeting of these trustees to consider my statement regarding the ill-treatment of my friend John Mackenzie. The Chairman first of all imputes motives -- that my motive must be to damage the institution, and to injure some of the people connected with the institu- tion. Sir, that is an unworthy insinuation. My only motive was to prevent others from suffering similarly. Would it not be much pleasanter on my part to go there and come away and be friendly with every one? But my sense of duty required that I should disclose what went on regarding my friend ; and then, Sir, he declares that I and others took shelter under my parliamentary privilege, and savs, " It is only Irishmen that shoot from behind." I should think that an Irishman would not feel very highly complimented by this statement of the worthy Chairman of that Board, because all history proves that there are no more brave or valiant men in the British army or in the British Empire than Irish soldiers. However, that is by the way. Sir, he stated that I did not name the nurse who struck him. If the man had told me the name of the nurse I should have named her ; but it occurred at night, so he told me-I do not vouch for the accuracy of the statement; 1 simply state what the man told me-but, as the man was groaning, he probably did not know who did it. In that connection a very interesting letter appears by one of the defenders of the institution. He first of all donies that the patient was struck, and then states that, if he was struck, no woman would do that unless he richly deserved it. Then, Sir, regarding the utensils that I said were absent, the Chairman declares that they were always there, and then he goes on to narrate the circumstances of my making some strong statements with regard to the hospital. This is what he says: "This is a public institution, and he would see that the public were better served in it, and that he would see the authorities and make them all 'sit up.' " And then Mr. Carroll, one of the Board, ejaculated. " What check !" Of course, Mr. Carroll should have felt angry that I should 
<page:640>
ness. Now, the point I wish to put clearly is this : If that man had been properly treated, and if the conveniences were there, why should I have kicked up a row, and called the nurse's attention to it, and at once asked my friend to see Mackenzie's doctor? It is fortunate they admit this incident, and they will find a diffi- culty in getting over it. Then, they go on to say, " When the nurse came along, she re- ferred ine to the hospital doctor." No such thing occurred ; I sent word to the doctor attending the man. The next point in this rather hysterical display that occurred in Dunedin was when the Chairman went on to say that "the nurse and the authorities were not aware I was a member of Parliament." think it is very fortunate that people in office are not always aware when members of Parlia- ment are about. When I was connected with some of my explorations I found some of the most interesting occurrences in all my career, because I was not known in my rough bush clothes. I remember on one occasion going to a railway-station, when I wanted several second-class tickets for some of the men of my party. The stationmaster refused to give me them, and said I should be there five minutes before the train started, and that the station- master was not there to suit the convenience of every tramp knocking about the country. In last November, when I was travelling by train from Christchurch, all my goods were put out of the carriage, and in explanation I was told they were not aware I was a mem- ber of Parliament, otherwise I might have had a reserved carriage to myself. Therefore members see, one discovers little irregularities when one moves about incog., and when it is not quite known who you are. Then the Chair-   man of the Hospital Board makes a great point of the fact that I went to see this sick man and took no fruit with me, and did not even spend sixpence on this man. First of all, the statement is incorrect, and if it were correct it could not possibly have any bearing on the case. I do not want to talk about what I have done, but I may say I both sent and took fruit to my friend, which can easily be verified. Then, Sir, he says : "Why did I not go myself to Dr. Macpherson ?" I explained, I rang up and had him communicated with. Then they say, after arranging to take the man away, it was not done, although the house surgeon said he could then have been taken to any part of New Zealand. What an inaccurate statement, The doctor said he was too weak to be removed ; and had he been fit to travel, long before that I had been ready to take him to Rotorua myself, as is well known by John's friends. Then, Sir, I say too, in this connection, that evidently the Hospital Board are working up public sympathy for the nurses. They never mention the doctors perhaps the Cusack case was in their minds-but they talk about an attack being made on the defenceless nurses. Sir, the statements were not made on the nurses alone, but on the institution, and particularly on the doctor who had browbeaten the man Mr. T. Mackenzie should be properly attended to. Sir, for my part I know there are many excellent nurses in that institution. I have already said so in this House. But, Sir, is nothing to be said for the men and women who enter the institution from the back blocks? A great many of the patients who enter the institution are men who come from up-country, and I ask, Is nothing to be said for these patients? Sir, we know these institutions get support from the State to the extent of hundreds of thousands of pounds. and we are, therefore, justified in asking that proper treatment should be meted out to the patients. Then, a member of the Hospital Board, who is also a member of the City Council says I made untrue statements with regards I the actions of the Council, but he does not say to what statements he refers. Now that I have little more time I will quote, Sir, from a letter in my possession, which was referred to pre- viously by the member for Dunedin City .Mr. Arnold). This is my letter to the Hon. M .. Ward : - "MY DEAR WARD,-I congratulate you on your activity in taking stringent measures to check the chances of success to the plague. I! you are communicating to the Dunedin Citr authorities you should insist on that boc; stopping people from discharging filth into the Water of Leith stream. I am told that the City Council say the Lands Department have control of the stream ; but, whoever are responsible. i should be stopped." The honourable gentleman took up the mitter. and succeeded in stopping the nuisance, so that. as far as my statements in that connection am concerned, there is nothing to be said to :h contrary. Sir, it has also been stated by other honourable members in this House that they have heard the statements of patients in bx pitals who have been treated in very much ?? same way that John Mackenzie was treats The member for Masterton can tell us sec- thing of the same story. Then, there is a mx- ber who comes from the South who has also told me some strong things in connection with hospital treatment. For my part, Sir, I do not wish it to be misunderstood. 1 consider the hospital is a very excellent institution. My reason for bringing the matter up publicty is that public attention may be called to it, and that the authorities, who may not know what is going on, should be informed of matters as they really are. They may not have opportunities of knowing, and it is only right they should know of them, so that any evils that exist may be remedied. I have bumped against a few big interests and institu- tions in my time, and raised many hornets nests, and may do so again. But I feel sure. Sir, that great good will result in many parts of the colony by the matter being ventilated in the House. In conclusion, Sir, I wish to say it has never been my desire to court notoriety b: pointing out a matter of this sort : and the Chairman, Mr. Millar, in straining at motives and calling names, was unworthy of himsi As a rule, one brings more public odium that 
<page:641>
favourable report on one's-self, as can easily be seen in this case, but I do not mind that, as vast good will be done by it. I have never, either inside or outside of the House, been afraid to state the truth in connection with any matter, and I venture to say that this Parlia- ment will bear me out in saying that I have always fearlessly exposed any evil, irrespective of what the consequences might be, and will always do so. Bill read a third time. On the question of the title, Mr. HALL-JONES .- Sir, I wish to move to strike out the word "Hospital" in the Short Title, and also in the main title. The reason is, that in clause 4A we make provision for other nurses than those who have had hospital train- ing. Motion agreed to, and Bill passed. ROTORUA TOWN COUNCIL VALIDATION AND EXTENSION BILL. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said the next order of the day was a Bill to validate the Rotorua Town Council's position. At present the Coun- cil was not lawfully constituted, and payments were overdue for some time. It was purely a local Bill, and it would not take more than a few minutes to put it through all its stages. Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands) said that he would like this Bill to be put through all its stages now, as it was a matter of urgency, as the salaries of the staff for the last month were  not paid. There was nothing but the legalisa- tion of the acts done by the Town Council, with the exception of the proposal to give power to extend the borough, which had been in contemplation. As it was found that the Council had not been lawfully constituted, the Bill also contained validating powers. The Bill was a short one, and he would ask the House to pass it through all its stages before the Finan- cial debate came on. He moved the second reading. Bill read a second and a third time. # FINANCIAL STATEMENT. On the motion for going into Committee of Supply, Captain RUSSELL (Hawke's Bay). - Mr. Speaker,-Sir, I suppose there will be no dis- pute upon one point-that is, that when Parlia- ment is asked to discuss the financial position of the colony without any of the returns neces- sary to a careful examination of those finances, that all those honourable members who, un- fortunately, have not the advantage of getting facilities from Ministers in getting knowledge as to the finances of the colony, stand at a very great disadvantage. I am dreadfully con- scious myself of the difficulties that I, at any rate, labour under owing to these circum- stances. Sir, it is true that the larger amounts connected with the expenditure of the colony are placed before us in the Financial State- ment in outline, but we have no opportunity of verifying these figures, and, without doing so, it is difficult to know whether they are VOL. CXVII .- 40. accurate or not. Departmental returns, we all realise, are accurate. The statements of Ministers anxious to make the very best of a bad job are not nearly so reliable as figures which are put before us by departments. We have not the Post Office returns, we have not that financial paper known as B .- 1, nor the Lands Report, and, beyond all, we have not the report of the working railways, so that we are, in connection with the most material points of the administration of the Government, practi- cally in the dark as to what has taken place during the past year. But examining the State- ment as I find it, it is difficult to know exactly what importance to attach to it. There is through the whole of it a subdued tone of irony and a very noticeable tone of insincerity. One scarcely can understand what the object of the Premier has been in putting many of the figures and statements into the Budget before us, un- less it has been with almost deliberate intent to mislead. Sir, it has been a theory of the Right Hon. the Premier's for many years that we should "trust the people." But, if one reads his Statement from one end to the other, it will be seen that he has departed very materially from that theory. He has trusted the people very little ; but his practice has been on almost every occasion, and in almost every department, to "bribe the people." That is the key-note of the Statement placed before us. The enormous increase of the public debt, and of the liabilities both of the Consolidated Fund and of the Public Works Fund have caused, and do cause, the very gravest alarm throughout the whole colony. It is true that the Right Hon. the Premier in the Financial Statement says that there is no cause for alarm whatsoever ; that the re- venue will balance the expenditure during the coming year, and that there will be a surplus on 31st March. But it is a fact, and I am sorry to say that I believe that it is a necessary fact, that thinking people are greatly alarmed as to the position of the revenue of the colony during the ensuing year ; and if there is one man more than another in the whole colony to whom is due that alarm, which has pervaded the whole of the community, it is the Right. Hon. the Premier himself. In his Financial Statement, in the third paragraph, I think it is, he makes fun of those persons who have been alarmed. He says in the Statement that they have made "financial hotch - potch " of the ac- counts; and he describes those gentlemen of the Press who have commented upon his own statements as mere " penny-a.liners," and then he continues to make a poor joke at the expense of those merchants of whom he tells us in his own Financial Statement. His words are :- "The credence given to the imagination of the ' penny-a-liner ' should not be found fault with by me, for, with a patriotism that does them infinite credit-which as Colonial Trea- surer I very much appreciate-merchants have risen to the occasion, cleared kerosene, sugar, and tea, with the result that the Customs revenue this month is buoyant in the extreme, and contrasts very favourably with the same month of last year."

Sir, I maintain it was the duty of the Right Hon. the Premier, being Colonial Treasurer, when he became conscious that words of his own had created alarm throughout the colony as to our financial position, to have immediately taken steps to allay the alarm, and that instead of that sneer in his Financial Statement he ought to have seen the trade of the colony was not disturbed simply because he had used words, which, I presume, now he deems to have been ill-considered. Sir, he has led the people to suppose that those persons who have written upon his statement to the deputation mistook altogether what he said ; such, how- ever, was not the case-it was the very reverse of the case ; and here I may say that I have every reason to believe that the report which was published in the Lyttelton Times of the 3rd August, 1901, did actually represent the speech made by the Right Hon. the Premier to the deputation. As published in the Lyttelton Times, it bears within itself intrinsic evidence of its accuracy. And even were that not the case, I, at any rate, believe that a journal which is not an opponent of the Government, and which is so well conducted, would not pub- lish any statement unless the editor had taken trouble to verify the fact that it came from a responsible source. Though the Right Hon. the Premier tells us in his Financial Statement that the "penny-a-liners " have jumbled up the consolidated revenue with the loan account, such was not the case at all. I have here the actual words used by the Hon. the Premier. Mr. SEDDON. Reported to have been used.  Captain RUSSELL .- As reported, I should say. Mr. PIRANI .- Reported by the Premier? Mr. SEDDON .- They were not reported by the Premier. Captain RUSSELL .- I have only an hour in which to speak ; please be quiet. Mr. SEDDON .- Well, keep that gentleman behind you quiet. Captain RUSSELL .- Whether this was re- ported by the Premier himself, as is generally believed, or whether it was reported by some special correspondent of the Lyttelton Times, I do not, of course, profess to know; but I reiterate again that the published report must have been brought under the notice of the Right Hon. the Premier; and if it misrepre- sented what he did say, it was his duty imme- diately to make public that it was incorrect, and that there was no cause for alarm. Mr. SEDDON .- The Lytteiton Times cor- rected itself in a day or two. Captain RUSSELL .- The report says,- " The spending policy had been increasing at far too rapid a rate, and it was time to go slow once more, or the consequence might be such as he scarcely liked to contemplate." And then the report continues,- " Discussing the ordinary balance-sheet of the colony, the Premier said this also had caused him very much anxiety. For the last financial year they had an excess of receipts over expenditure amounting to half a million ; in framing the estimates for the current year Captain Russell he was unable to make the receipts equal the expenditure. Parliament had made the people large presents by abatements in the Customs and postage, and now it would be necessary to look for more revenue to meet the deficiency. The position must be faced, but it was by no means a pleasant one." Now, that is the statement made by the Right Hon. the Premier, and I regret to say- Mr. SEDDON .- I have told you several times that I never made that statement. You might put it that I have been reported to have made it. Captain RUSSELL .- Then I will 8.0. put it in this way : that the Premier is reported to have made that statement; and I will add to that, he took no trouble to con- tradict it when he read it, which he un- doubtedly would have done if it had not been substantially accurate. Well, now, in examin- ing the figures in the Financial Statement-  and one is only able, at least I am only able-to take them in their broadest aspect, I admit the grave apprehension the Premier is reported to have expressed I express without hesitation. To me it seems that the finances are such as to lead every person who has the welfare of the colony and a belief in the virtues of economy at heart, to fear there is serious danger in front of us. And when I come to think what a huge increase in the departmental expenditure is proposed for this year, it seems to me that it would have been better if, instead of making these large increases in departmental expendi- ture, proper caution had been used in framing the estimates to prevent the possibility alluded to by the Premier of, in a short time, there being a necessity for further and increased taxation. The Premier says, and I am now quoting from the Financial Statement, which is not what he is reported to have said, but what he read to the House,-the Premier said this: "When increased taxation is re- quired to meet the ordinary expenditure, so surely will reductions in salaries eventuate." This seems to me to be a most discouraging statement for all the people who are employed It can mean only in the Government service. one thing : that the Premier fears that bad times are coming, and that his policy will be a policy which I maintain is a wrong policy-to reduce the salaries of those in Government employ. That it will be necessary to practise economy I recognise; but the whittling off of small slices of salaries as a national economy. which can have any practical result, is a thing I do not believe in at all. And when we know that in the report of the statement the Premier made to the deputation he said in so many words, " It will be necessary to look for more revenue," it appears to me a warning to the persons whose salaries are going to be increased this year that they will hold them in jeopardy unless their economical administration is such as to insure a balance of revenue over expendi- ture. There is an increase in the departmental expenditure this year of $280,670. This, in face of the diminishing revenue-a revenue 
<page:643>
admitted by the Premier in his own Statement to be a shrinking one! And it is evidenced by a remarkable falling-off in the Customs revenue for the June quarter, for notwithstanding the fact that this quarter's Customs receipts have been enormously increased by the lavish ex- penditure, consequent upon the visit of their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York, there is a diminution in the June quarter's Customs revenue from the correspond- ing quarter of last year of no less than £24,148, which in round numbers is a shrinkage of $100,000 a year, though the comparison is made in that quarter which, I believe, is less likely to show a shrinkage than any other quarter will be. Because, as we have been told by the Premier in the Statement in two or three different parts, the visit of their Royal High- nesses the Duke and Duchess of York caused a considerable clearance of certain articles, more especially ad valorem articles, which go to swell the revenue. It is true-I have not time to read it - that the right honourable gentleman has endeavoured to mislead - not the House, for, of course, we know better-but to mislead the country-for it was the coun- try that he was addressing in the Financial Statement-by leading it to suppose that all the large expenditure consequent upon the visit of their Royal Highnesses took place in the last financial year. Sir, he knows full well that their Royal Highnesses did not arrive in this country for more than two months after the close of the last financial year ; and, therefore,  the expenditure of the last financial year was in no appreciable degree-and, in fact, one may say, in no degree whatever-increased by the exceptional expenditure consequent upon the Royal visit. I am afraid that the evidence of the shrinkage of the Customs revenue portends a heavier fall than that which is foreshadowed by the Premier in the estimates for the current year. He estimates the decrease in Customs revenue will be $70,862. I only trust that may be the case, but I am afraid it will be exceeded, though he is bolstering up his expenditure in every possible way, because he wishes still to remain true to his false principle-that is, that to achieve popularity you must bribe the people. Sir, I find this passage in the State- ment,- " It must be pleasing to honourable members to know that the elasticity of finance, for which our colony is noted, still continues, and that, notwithstanding the concessions granted last year, our Customs revenue is buoyant, and more than realises expectations. The Customs revenue is the barometer of the spending power of the people, and also of our prosperity, and the indicator points between 'fair ' and ' set fair,' whilst the financial meteorologist an- nounces a blue and cloudless sky." That paragraph is put into the Statement when the Right Hon. the Premier has the salient facts before him of the shrinkage to which I alluded of nearly $24,148 on one item in one quarter, and that the first quarter of this financial year. Instead of telling us that the sky is blue, and that the meteorologist says that it is cloudless, it would have been better if he had remembered that the meteor- ologists sometimes say that there is a "wide- spread depression prevailing over all parts of New Zealand "; and that to my mind is a truer way of putting what the weather prophet would say if he had been allowed to say anything as to the question of the buoyancy of our reve- nue. Well, now having drawn the attention of the House to the dangerous condition of our Customs revenue-and here I would pause to say that the unfortunate facts in connection with the great staple industry of the colony- namely, wool, are such that it is not unreason- able to suppose, unless there is a sharp rise in the value of wool during the next year, a heavy depression will come upon the main industry of the colony such as has not prevailed here in that particular branch of industry since the year 1870. I, as an old farmer, can say with truth, I believe that in no time during all the years I have been engaged in the pursuit have I known prices nearly so low as at the present time; and the result must be a decrease in spending power, and a fall in the Customs re- venue. The result must be a hugely diminish- ing spending power on the part of both the em- ployer and the employed, and with the result that there will be less travelling upon the railways, less money spent on the Customs, less money spent on amusements of every possible kind ; and in all probability, a serious fall may be coming in each particular branch of the revenuo. Well, now, let us take another, also an important branch of the Government service - I allude to the railways. And here I would briefly say how unjust it is that we have not been furnishd with the details in connection with their management. It is all very well to say that the staff has been engaged in connection with the Royal visit, and that they have not been enabled to pre- pare returns. I maintain that no such thing really can be believed by any reasonable person. I have heard it stated, and I will not say I disbelieve it, that many of these returns we are now unavailingly asking for, and which it is said it is impossible to prepare from want of time, are at the present time in Ministers' own offices, tied up with blue ribband, and all ready to lay on the table of the House so soon as the financial debate is finished. The Hon. the Premier may laugh. Well, at any rate, I have heard that upon authority which I believe to be good, and if it is not so it ought to be so. We are now several months past the end of the financial year, and there is no possible reason why every account, and every detail of the administration of the past year, should not have been in the hands of members long before this. But, Sir, there is another misleading statement in the Financial Statement. Weare told in so many words, on the fourth page, that the railway revenue is in excess of the previous year's revenue by £99,028. That is another example of how faith is kept to the ear, but in reality is broken in fact. When the Right Hon. the Premier wrote the paragraph about the ex- cess of revenue from railways over last year of 
<page:644>
£99,028 he must have been endeavouring wil- fully to mislead everybody who listened to him, or anybody who might read the Financial State- ment, for the very reverse is the case. It is true that the receipts for 1891 did exceed the previous year's receipts by €99,028, but it took ¥105,565 to earn that extra sum ; and an easy sum in subtraction will show that the net revenue from the railways was $6,537 less this year than it was the year before. And yet through all parts of the colony-and, in all probability, telegraphed home to England-is the assertion made that there was $99,028 ex- cess of revenue this year. But, Sir, that does not really get to the bottom of the whole mat- ter ; the loss is really very considerably more than the sum I have already named. Of course, one ought to deduct the liabilities on the con- solidated estimates for the railways for the pre- sont year from the liabilities which were against the railways the preceding year. And here I would pause for one instant to point out how enormously the liabilities have increased, both in the Consolidated Fund and in the Public Works Fund, during the past year. In the year 1900 there were $74,911 of liabilities, and this year they have grown to $90,777. If, then, we add the difference, which is #15,856-liabilities on the consolidated revenue which ought to have been paid on the 31st March, although they were not-members will find there was a deficiency of $22,403, or rather less pro- fits than there were in the preceding year. But by way of making sure that we are abso- lutely accurate, and to give the benefit of the doubt to Ministers, I would point out that the difference between the contingent liability in the preceding year, 1899-1900, was €8,742, which reduces the net loss on the working of the railways this year to €13,661. And that does not exhaust the subject, because there has been expended during the past year £717,722 upon railways ; and as the interest on that ¥717,722 has to be met, and as I have shown the receipts from the railways are less than the year before, we have the interest on that sum to add to the loss on working-expenses. It seems to me the loss we are likely to make on our railways is also a matter of very serious importance. Now, I have taken the trouble, in connection with this railway expenditure, to examine the various tables in the Financial Statement dealing with the rate of interest we are paying on our loans, and honourable mem- bers no doubt know - but the people generally do not know- how high a rate of interest we are still paying on the major portion of our loans. I find we pay 6 per cent. on £43,675, 5 per cent. on $530,245, 44 per cent. on $52.900, and 4 per cent. on $30,958,280; so that there is at 4 per cent. and at above 4 per cent. a sum of £31,585,100, which is a very serious state of things. At 3% per cent. there is $334,000, and at 3} per cent. $10,698,203, making above 3 per cent. a sum of £11,042,203 ; whilst at 3 per cent. there is $6, 148,810, and at 24 per cent. there is $19,000. Sir, I may be asked what have these figures to do with the management of the rail- ways. Well, none of these loans-I believe I Captain Russell am right in saying so-were floated at par, and so, though we pay interest on the nominal total of our debt, $49,591,245, we have not received so much money as that, but we pay interest on $49,591,245 though we have not received it. And of that sum more than three fifths is pay- ing interest at 4 per cent. and above 4 per cent. Of course, the interest is proportionately higher than 4 per cent., seeing, as I have already stated, we have not received in cash the total nominal amount of our indebtedness. Now, in this con- nection I wish to warn the House - and this is my object-against the present comfortable doctrine that we are to run our railways to yield a profit of 3 per cent. only. The words of the Financial Statement are, "Next year. and with abnormal expenditure eliminated, we hope to grant such concessions as will bring down the net earnings on our railways to 3 per cent." Now, let us examine the facts of the case. The cost of the railways on the 31st March last open for traffic is $17,207,328; but the i liabilities on the 31st March, 1901, are $447,388: making a total cost on our railways up to the 31st March, in money paid or in liabilities. of £17,654,716. But though that is the sum set down as the amount which our railways have cost, I think no one will dispute that if the accounts had been kept by any company building railways the sum set down as con- struction would have been infinitely higher. During all the years they have not paid cost of construction ; during all the years that an attempt was not made even to work them, the interest should have been debited in some way to the capital cost. I think that in reality I am understating the position considerably if I say \--- that the cost of our railways would not stand in any company's books under $20,000,000 sterling. if books had been properly kept. Now, Sir. the figures I have quoted about our loans prove that three-fifths of the money borrowed costs the colony over 4 per cent., and the railways were built when rates of interest were bish. As these 4-per-cent. loans are not payable until the 1st November, 1929, we are encumbered with loans paying a high rate of interest for twenty- eight years hence. I fail to see the justice, then. of taxing the community for a quarter of century to the amount of $200,000 a year. that being the difference between 3 and 4 per cent. on $20,000,000. I think that this is specially unjust, seeing that the large mass of the people of the country do not use the railways much. of use them very slightly indeed, and the indirect benefits gained by them are so infinitesimaliy small that they cannot be taken into account at all. Sir, I do not want the House to mis- take me. I do not want honourable members to think that I object to low rates ; but what I have always contended for is that our railways ought to be managed upon commercial prin- ciples, and that there ought to be an idea of reducing rates to the lowest possible point com- patible with the assurance that there will be no loss of revenue. To arbitrarily fix the rate of interest that our railways are to earn a: 3 per cent., while the great bulk of the capi- tal invested in them has cost considerably over 
<page:645>
them at the cost of those who cannot do so. Another question I would like to touch upon, if time permitted, is that of the excessive and increasing payments out of loan for mainten- ance, and for the up - keep of engines and rolling-stock. As I have already said, unfor- tunately we have not the necessary data to speak with authority on the subject. I must therefore defer any remarks upon the manage- ment of the working railways until such time as Ministers are graciously pleased to allow the representatives of the people to obtain the in- formation which ought to be placed at their disposal at the earliest date after Parliament meets. Sir, the concessions which were made in freights and fares seem to have been made entirely irrespective of the principles of true finance, and irrespective of any idea that the railways should be run to the best possible advantage. One principle only underlies these concessions, like everything else, and that is by some means or other the Government must bribe the people. Now, in the Statement there are to be found endless comparisons between the periods 1891 to 1901. And it almost seems to me as if it was a valedictory effort on the part of the Right Hon. the Premier, as though this was to be his last Budget, and that therefore he wanted to draw a comparison between the finances and the population when he came into office and as we now find it. It is not a generous action to disparage, or endeavour to disparage, one's predecessors ; but we know if it is necessary to work a point by  disparagement of others it does not interfere at all with the utterances that come from the Ministerial benches. But let me endeavour to extend the comparison to the previous decade, and then let us see what that comparison proves-and by doing this I am not disparaging any person, because various Ministers were in office ; but one can arrive, by comparing the previous decennial period with the last one, whether anything has been gained by the popularity-hunting policy of the present Go- vernment. In 1881 the net public debt amounted to £27,108,270, and between then and 1891 it rose to £37,359,157, an increase in that decennial period of ₺10,250,887 ; whilst the railways increased from 1,287 miles to 1,840 miles of open lines, an increase of 555 miles. Between 1891 and 1901 the debt grew from £37,359,157 to £49,591,245-an increase, I may say, in the last year of £1,627,675; but the total increase for that decennial period was £12,232,088, whilst the railways opened in- creased only from 1,842 miles to 2,212 miles, or only a further increase of 370 miles with more than twelve millions increase of debt, against 555 miles with a smaller increase of debt in the previous decade. And that is not all, because there were huge sums of money, the amount of which I cannot recollect at the present moment - approximately $3,000,000-which were trans- ferred from the consolidated revenue to Public Works Fund, all of which money must have been scattered somewhere, but where I admit I do not know. It is extremely difficult to roads, bridges, or some purpose or another, and in most instances to bribe the people. Now, the foregoing statements of comparison which I have made are not so indicative of the profligacy of the Government as the Public Works Fund expenditure of the last three years, when com- pared with the expenditure of the Public Works Fund of the last three years of the last Ad- ministration. Therefore, I propose to draw a comparison between the three years imme- diately precedent to the accession of the pre- sent Ministry to office with the three last years of the present Government. In the year 1888 the debt amounted to 135,536,381, and it rose in 1891 to $37,359,137, an increase for the three years of £1,822,776. But to be perfectly fair, and to endeavour to put the case strictly accurately before the House, I admit that there were liabilities on the Public Works Fund Ac- count at that time of #240,385; so that if we add these liabilities to the debt I have already quoted it makes a total increased debt during the three years ending March, 1891, while Sir Harry Atkinson was Treasurer, of £2,063,161, or $687,720 a year. Now let us examine the last three years that the Right Hon. the Premier has been Treasurer. On the 31st March, 1898, the debt was 8.30. £44,081,521, and it had risen on the 31st March last to $49,591,245, an increase during three years not of £1,822,776, as it rose during his predecessor's term of office, but of $5,509,724. But again I would like to make the account as accurate as I can, and I find, on looking through the tables in the Public Works Statement, that the liabilities on the Public Works Fund on the 31st March, 1901, were the appalling sum of £1,292,095. This makes the total increase during the three last years of the public debt of the colony £6,801,819, or £2,267,273 for every year, which is #204,1 12 each year more than the £2,063,161 which was raised by Sir Harry Atkinson during the three years he was in office. But then, of course, this is a self-reliant, non-borrowing Government, to whom much is to be excused. Much ! During the whole period of the public works policy there has been no such extravagant expenditure as has been made by the right honourable gentleman during the last three years. Now, it is clear - even the census returns show-taking the quinquennial period which ended on the 31st March, 1891, that during that period of depression the population increased by 8} per cent. Taking the last census returns, the last quinquennial period ending on the 31st March, 1901, notwithstanding all this profligate expenditure, the increase of the population of the colony has only been 8g per cent. There- fore it would appear to me that the present Government has failed to justify its policy by the rapid increase of population, by giving us more railways, or by in any way materially benefiting the people. In fact, the outlook is serious, for on page x. of the Financial State- ment we find, "The latest census of the people proved that during the last five years our popu- lation had been, relatively to the previous five  
<page:646>
years-that is, from 1891 to 1896-actually de- creased in numbers by 7,366 persons." These few words contain a whole volume of condemna- tion of the Government policy. The Govern- ment have endeavoured-and I believe they have meant to do well-they have endeavoured to place the people upon the land. I shall be able to show they have failed in doing that successfully. They have promised to make railways. I have shown that they have made fewer miles of railway than were made in a similar previous period. I have proved the debt has increased enormously, and population has not proportionately increased ; and I believe they have unsettled trade and industry, and have done an incalculable amount of harm to the colony by their policy. I find, on examin- ing the figures, that the population in counties in 1891 was 352,097, and in boroughs 270,343, showing 81,754 as the difference between those who lived in boroughs and in the country in favour of the country. And we find in 1901, also taking the census returns, the dwellers in the country are 417,477, and in the boroughs 350,097, showing now the difference between the popu- lation in the country and the boroughs is only 67,380, instead of 81,754 in the previous period. Now, this, I think, goes far to prove that, though millions have been borrowed to put people on the land, though millions have been borrowed and expended in public works, the increase of the population is at a standstill : the people are not settling on the land so much as before, and the policy of bribing the people has not been successful. If I have any time left I should like to say a few words in regard to the Crown tenants, and it is exceedingly interesting to me to find on page xix. of the Statement that the very course the Opposition have agitated for for some years past has at last received the ap- proval of the Premier. We have advocated and said all along we who know something about the necessities of pioneer life in the country -- that settling men on bush farms in the back blocks, without roads, is an absolutely hopeless undertaking. We have pointed out over and over again that arterial roads ought to be made into the bush lands, and when the settlers occupy them they ought, themselves, at the time when their properties are not bring- ing in any profits, to be allowed to work on the branch roads so as to give access to their farms, and get employment and earn some money when they cannot be profitably working on their own farms. I am glad to see that the Premier is adopting this principle. But he constantly adopts his opponents' policy without ever admitting it; it is only another evidence of the anfractuosity of the Premier's character. How marked is the contrast between the policy now shadowed in the Financial Statement in regard to the bush farmers with the principle of compulsory rating upon unimproved values. The Statement-one has unfortunately not time to read the passage-admits that, after four years of unremitting and unwearied and un- rewarded toil and accumulated thrift, there are not sufficient earnings from the farm to pay the rent of the bush settler, and he has to have Captain Russell recourse to the money-lender. What, then, I would ask the Premier, is the unimproved value of the farm ? He himself asserts in his Statement that, notwithstanding the arduous  work of the farmer for some four years. he is deriving no profit whatever from the pro- perty, and. though the whole of the work of himself, his wife, and his family are put into the farm, he is obliged at the end, after four  years of ceaseless toil and unremitting anxiety, to go to the money-lender to borrow money to pay his rent. How the principle of compulsory taxation on unimproved value is to be justified passes my comprehension. Mr SEDDON. - You are mistaken ; I did not say at the end of four years. Read it again. Captain RUSSELL .- Well, you say for two  years there are no returns, and two years more pass over and he is still behind. Now, the sug- gestion which I have so often made-that the expenditure of the money we are borrowing for the compulsory purchase of estates would be far better expended in driving arterial roads through country not already settled - is the true one; in other words, instead of driving people off property already paying taxation. giving employment to many, and producing considerable profit to the State, it would be far better to spend the money in roading and opening up fresh country. It would pay the colony better, it would pay the industrious settler far better, and the true principle of colonisation would be carried out, instead of merely a policy, in too many instances, of political confiscation. Here is the passage in the Statement that I previously alluded to : - "From facts which have come within my \-- knowledge it is quite clear that a person taking up bush land, and having little or no capital. cannot pay rent until the land vields a re- turn. There are practically no returns for two years. By that time two years' rent are in arrear, and the yield is not sufficient to main- tain the settler and his family. Another two years pass over and still find him behind in payment of his rent, or, if he has paid the rent. he has probably had to borrow the money for that purpose. Under these circumstances it is much better that the State should insist upon the improvement conditions being strictly com- plied with, and allow the tenant to sit rent- free for the first four or five years." Well, I am glad to believe that this solicitude of the Right Hon. the Premier for the Crown tenant is the result of the formation of the Farmers' Union, and that the farmers are to receive some of the attention-I do not say, perhaps, more attention than he has given to the trades unions in the towns. Speaking as & farmer, I have no desire whatsoever that the Farmers' Union should grow in any way into a political association. I believe it will be far stronger if it is not a political association. That it will be a power in the country I firmly believe, and this concession to the farmers is. at any rate, evidence that their wants are being forced on the attention of the Premier. @ thing which he probably never considered in 
<page:647>
there shall be a line of steamers provided to carry the produce of our farmers to South Africa. Well, Sir, all I can say is this : that if the New Zealand Steam Shipping Company, or the Tyser Company, and the Shaw - Savill Company are unable to carry our goods at a profit to South Africa and get return cargoes from there, then no Govern- ment Administration will ever make a line of steamers pay half so well as companies ac- customed to the running of these steamers are likely to do. What possible trade can there be between the Cape and here ? There pro- bably for a time will be some trade between here and the Cape. That, I think, is quite possible ; but the only trade I know of that is likely to come to the colony from the Cape will be inhnitesimal, and is more likely to take the form of ostrich-feathers and diamonds than anything else, and certainly it would not be worth while chartering large steamers to carry what trade might be required from South Africa. I think that all the diamonds likely to be used in New Zealand might be carried in anybody's waistcoat-pocket without any incon- venience to the wearer. It is possible that the providing of cool-storage at the Cape is a question that may be worth consideration ; but there, again, I am very much inclined to think that cool-storage would be better pro- vided by freezing companies than it would be by the Government. But the suggestion that the Right Hon. the Premier should control the frozen-meat trade in England is really too good a joke almost to put in his Financial Statement. He speaks as though New Zealand was the only country engaged in the meat trade. This is a country, no doubt, that has a great future before it; but that our frozen-meat industry could be made under Government management to control the whole of the frozen-meat industry of England, is really, Sir, too good a joke, especially when we know the United States of America is pouring huge quantities of meat into England, chilled, frozen, and alive; when we know that Canada is doing the same, that Argentina is supplying huge quantities too, and that Australia is doing the same, and in all probability will continue to do so in as large, if not larger, quantities. The idea that any Government bureau that we can establish can regulate the frozen-meat trade in England, and regulate compulsorily the trade of the remainder of the world-well, Sir, all I can say is that the Premier is indeed verdant if he believes that. I believe he thinks nothing is beyond his powers; but probably if he enters into the meat trade there, even he, great as he is, will come to unmitigated grief. I have a few words just to say in conclusion. No doubt many honourable members are familiar with the scene in Mozart's celebrated opera, Don Giovanni, where Don Giovanni, or, as he is called in Spanish, Don Juan de Tenorio of Seville, who is depicted as the type of the scep- tical libertine, and who has killed Comman- dant Ulloa and betrayed his daughter, at a banquet insults the memory of the comman- moonlight in the castle garden. The statue descends from its pedestal, enters the banquet- ing-hall, and carries off Don Juan to a pit, whence emerge sulphurous flames. The Right Hon. the Premier reminds me irresistibly of that banquet scene. He is the type of the political sceptic and libertine. He believes in no such thing as honesty of conviction or virtuous con- duct. By his policy he has killed the work of his former commandant, betrayed the child of his later years, and now by a proposition-the most extravagant ever put before Parliament - of a public works expenditure of £1,950,000, he insults the memory of his former " revered leader." I shudder ; I look round ; I fear lest the statue which shimmers in the moonlight in our castle garden should descend from its pedestal, on which is written "He loved the people," and, like the statue in the opera, enter this Chamber and drag off our Don Juan, enveloped in blue flame and mephitic vapour. Mr. SEDDON .- It would take some one to carry me off. Captain RUSSELL .- It is not a question of carrying: Don Juan was compelled to follow. But, Sir, I have no doubt that when the Right Hon. the Premier retires from office his admirers may desire to erect a statue in his honour. Should they do so, upon the base of the pedestal upon which his statue stands should be writ large, in letters of brass, heavily gilded, " He bribed the people." Mr. NAPIER (Auckland City) .- Sir, Lord Randolph Churchill once said that every speech Lord Salisbury made lost ten thousand votes to the Conservative party. Captain RUSSELL .- He has a good big following still. Mr. NAPIER .- The speech which we have listened to to-night, I feel sure, has lost to the Opposition more than ten thousand votes in this country. The honourable member for Hawke's Bay made the burden of his speech an accusation that the Premier and the Govern- ment had pursued a policy of bribing the people. That was the burden of the honour- able gentleman's song. Bribery is a crime in which two or more persons participate, if it is done between individuals. There is the briber and the bribee-the person who gives and the person who accepts the bribe-and both persons are guilty of a criminal offence. Now, Sir, the honourable gentleman has accused the people of New Zealand, or, rather, the vast majority of the people, of persistently accepting bribes, and selling their confidence and their support for a monetary consideration. That is practi- cally, without any verbiage, the accusation made against the people of New Zea- land by the honourable gentleman ; because he did not say the bribes had been merely given during the last election, but that the bribes had extended over the period of office of the Right Hon. the Premier. Therefore he accuses the people of New Zealand of time after time accepting bribes knowingly, and, as I have said, of vesting their confidence in a person capable of pursuing a policy of bribery. 
<page:648>
to the overwhelming majority of the people of New Zealand. I shall deal with one or two points in the honourable gentleman's speech : the honourable gentleman and his party, as I before I refer to the Budget which has been have said, whenever the stress of bad times introduced to the House and the country. The ' came, went to the salaries and cut them down honourable gentleman first referred to the alleged statement made by the Premier that . sible. After referring to this alleged policy of a time of financial trouble had arrived, and . which was reported in the Lyttelton Times. Well, we have the Premier's assurance that he did not make that statement. We know as a fact there were no reporters present, and therefore that the report must have been manufactured -it certainly was garbled-and that no significance should have been attached to it. The honourable gentleman says the Premier should have corrected it. Why, if the Premier were to occupy his time in correct- ing every misstatement that appeared in the public Press of this colony the business of the country would have to wait, because the whole of his time would be occupied in correct- ing falsehoods and misstatements. The honour- able gentleman next referred to a statement in the Budget, which I think he misrepresented. ! That was the reference in the Budget speech to the possible reduction of salaries in the event of the ordinary expenditure exceeding the ordinary revenue in the future-a mere note of warning which was issued by the Premier in his Budget speech. The whole paragraph is to the follow- ing effect - the honourable gentleman used some of the words, but apart from the con- text :- "Coming to the demands upon the consoli-  dated revenue, the several services of the colony have necessarily increased, and the strictest economy is necessary ; for if ever the time arrives when increased taxation is required to   meet the ordinary expenditure, so surely will reductions in salaries eventuate." Now, Sir, I can, perhaps, pardon the honour- able gentleman for his misconception or mis- representation of that paragraph, because, no doubt, there was present in his mind the fact thit reduction of salaries was a cardinal feature in the policy of the Conservative party in the past, and that it was one of the planks of the Atkinsonian Administration to reduce the salaries of the unfortunate Civil servants by 10 per cent. Sir, has the Liberal party ever been guilty of such a reduction of salaries ? On the contrary, the dominant note in all the various Budgets that have been produced to the country since the Liberal party came into office has been this : that ability should be recognised, that salaries should be increased where ability existed, and that the best talent, the brainiest men, should be retained for the public service. It is true that in one or two instances officers have gone to Australia, where they have been tempted by larger salaries ; and I, personally, would have preferred if even still larger salaries had been given to those able men to retain them for the service of the people here. But I maintain that, if you examine the various Budgets and the figures from the beginning of 1891, when the Liberal party Mr. Napier that they have never been guilty of docking the salaries of the Civil servants ; but that as the best and readiest economy that was pos- reducing salaries, the honourable gentleman said that the Premier, in order to keep popu- larity, must continue to bribe the people. Now, Sir, let us examine this statement for a mo- ment. I would ask, With what has the Premier bribed the people ? Is the money that has been expended on public works not their own ? What is the usual form of bribery, and in what does bribery consist ? Is it not the giving to a person as a consideration for doing an improper act something which does not belong to him, but which belongs to the one who offers the bribe? Does the honourable gentleman sug- gest that the expenditure of public money upon our public works is a bribing of the 1 people? I would ask, Is he prepared to advocate a policy of cessation of all public works? That is what his speech implies, and that is the predominant feature of his speech to-night-namely, that we should discontinue our policy of public works, because, according to the honourable gentleman, wherever money is being spent upon public works the public are being bribed. The honourable gentleman cannot possibly be misunderstood, for time and again he said that the expenditure of public moneys on public works was bribery. Will the honourable gentleman specify in what form the bribery took place ? Does he suggest that the money was taken out of the public Exchequer and given personally to people in the constituencies for electoral purposes ? Surely that is not what he means. It would be impossible. Captain RUSSELL .- Oh, would it ? Mr. NAPIER .- We have not yet discussed the estimates of this year in detail, but has the honourable gentleman ever suggested that any particular item on the estimates of former years was a bribe? During the time I have had the honour of being a member of this House 1 have never known him to suggest that any item in the estimates was a bribe, and that we ought to strike it out in consequence. Why does he not say that the money for the North Island Trunk Railway, for the Whangamomona, and for other lines should not be voted, for the reason that they are bribes? I am glad that the honourable gentleman made his speech to- night, because it is a clear enunciation of a policy of cessation of public works, and also an enunciation of a policy of running our railways on commercial lines. Sir, I will endeavour to show what running our railways on commercial lines means. Part of the policy of the Conser- vatives of this colony is to make the public services yield such a profit that taxation will be lightened, and the large landholders escape their legitimate contribution to the public Exchequer through the graduated land- tax. The honourable gentleman said in lugu- brious tones, like the lamentation of a Jeremiah, 
<page:649>
must come, and that there would be general depression. Sir, I contend that wool is no longer the chief staple product of this country. If the honourable gentleman will examine the nature of our exports, he will, I say, find that wool is no longer the chief staple product of this country. Fortunately, as the Treasurer has stated, our eggs are not all in one basket. I maintain, Sir, that when the policy 9.0. of land - settlement has proceeded further, when the great landed estates in the deserts of Hawke's Bay - deserts as far as people are concerned, but with soil so fertile that there could be a thriving population existing on that land - when the people are largely settled on that land it is not wool- growing that will be their chief industry. They will produce butter and meat, just as the Taranaki people have done, and what the honourable member advocated at the opening of a dairy factory at Hastings will take place. The honourable gentleman said-and he has repeated it in this House-that he recognises that the time must come when the day of the large landholder will have to pass away, and that the land will be cut up into small holdings for dairy purposes. In some parts of the colony that day has already arrived, and in other parts, and in Hawke's Bay, the day must inevitably come when the squatter will be as extinct as the moa. Now, Sir, the honourable member said, and made it the basis of a very strong indictment against the ad- ministration of the railways, that the extra earnings of the railways had been caused and secured by a greater expenditure, and that therefore there was no real increase at all. Sir, the honourable gentleman once said in this House that he did not understand finance. I think that he has a fair knowledge of finance ; but I would point out the fallacy of his reason- ing. If he would examine the items of which the increased expenditure consists he would find a large portion of the expenditure was for rolling-stock, and a large proportion of it was capital expenditure, and not depart- mental expenditure -- not wages, not the ordi- nary working-expenses and charges of adminis- tration, but was for the supply of additional conveniences and extra rolling-stock, new en- gines, and other equipment, and therefore that it was money that ought to have been legiti- mately charged against Capital Account. I will give an illustration to convince the honourable gentleman of the soundness of my contention. If a merchant, finding his business increasing, and finding that he had no longer sufficient room to carry on his extended trade, erected an additional story to his warehouse, would it not be absurd to charge that additional expendi- ture against the income for that year. In any financial policy there must be a Capital Account and an ordinary Expense Account. Therefore I contend that, unless the honour- able gentleman could show that the increased expenditure was composed exclusively of work- ing-expenses during the year - unless he can prove that, his argument falls to the ground gentleman next propounded a policy which I think will be scrutinised by the settlers of this colony with great and scrupulous care. He said, "It is not safe finance to so work the railways as to only secure a revenue of 3 per cent. I fail to see the justice of taxing the country to make up the excess over 3 per cent."; and then he wound up with the broad statement that our railways should be run on commercial principles. Captain RUSSELL .- No. Mr. NAPIER .- Did the honourable gentle- man not say our railways should be run on commercial principles ? Captain RUSSELL .- Quite so ; but I did not stop there. Mr. NAPIER .- Well, Sir, if the railways are to be run on commercial principles, what does it mean? It means that the railways are no longer to be utilised for opening up the country and for the development of the settlement of the land, but that you must wait until popula- tion in any particular district has increased to such an extent that the line to be made will be a paying railway from the outset. That is what it means. The honourable gentleman entirely overlooks the fact that almost every writer on railways and their functions at the present time, and even the great pluto- crats of America, state that railways ought to be worked upon a different principle. Even the writers upon railways in America, the land of plutocracy, the land of railway kings, demand that the railways of the United States ought not to be used, ought not to be constructed, for purely commercial reasons, for dividend-paying purposes, but for their indirect advantages to the State, and because they are a means of communication, just as roads are. An honourable members ays "No," but I main- tain, and reiterate what I have said, that all the best authorities-I have some here if the honourable gentleman would like to look at them-all the best authorities and writers on the subject state-and I think, myself, that most modern politicians agree with them-that rail- ways ought to be run primarily for the purpose of increasing the settlement and productivity of the country, of preventing the excessive aggregation of large masses of the people in towns, and of facilitating the intercommunica- tion of the people living in the various parts of a State. And I maintain that the primary object of working the railways in New Zealand ought to be to open up the country, to settle the back blocks, to bring the produce of the land from the remotest points to our ports, and to connect the great centres of population ; and that, even if a policy of that kind did not show in the balance-sheet a dividend of more than 3 per cent., the indirect advantages to the country would be enormous, and that conse- quential profits of great magnitude would accrue to the State, and would be secured by the people as a whole. Sir, the railways, of course, would be a splendid asset in the hands of the honourable member if he worked them upon the principles laid down by Jay Gould. We all 
<page:650>
he was asked if he would not run the railways in America in the interests of the people-if the interests of the people were not to be considered when pooling the railway system. He said, " Hang the public," or something to that effect, showing that he, and that the plutocrats of his class, had a contempt for the public interests, and that his own pocket and the pockets of his fellow-plutocrats were the only considerations that ought to guide a railway king. Now, the honourable gentleman, I maintain, by running the railways on commercial principles, adopts the principles of Jay Gould-that, the railways being a good working concern, and capable of earning a splendid commercial return, the best possible commercial return ought to be secured by running them. Captain RUSSELL .- No such thing. Mr. NAPIER .- Well, we will see how the honourable gentleman's speech appears in Han- sard. I took down as fairly as I could notes of what the honourable gentleman said, and I re- gret if I failed to gather his meaning on this point of his speech. I paid the greatest pos- sible attention to the honourable gentleman while he was speaking. Now, Sir, the honour- able gentleman made a further alleged point in his manifold indictment against the Govern- ment-namely, that the public debt had in- creased by a sum of €6,000,000 in the period to which he referred, and he said that that was a greater debt than was incurred during the whole of the Atkinson Administration, with which party the honourable gentleman was associated. But was that not a disingenuous  statement ? Does not the honourable gentle- man know that the £6,000,000, if any fair analysis were made of it, does not represent real debt? Does he not know that a large portion of it is earning more than the interest which is being paid for it, and that properties are now held by the State representing a large portion of the money ? Was there any Advances to Settlers Department in exist- ence in the Atkinson days ? And has a large portion of this $6,000,000 not been de- voted to the purpose of giving loans to farmers, from whom the Crown holds real-estate securi- ties ? Why, there are thousands of deeds in the strong-rooms of the public buildings of Wellington to represent a large portion of the six millions-deeds which are absolutely liquid securities, which, if there came a financial crisis, or if circumstances required it, could be used for borrowing fresh money if neces- sary, as they are absolutely free and un- pledged. The money has been borrowed prac- tically for the settlers of the country; the Go- vernment merely lends its name : no real debt is incurred, no burden imposed on the general taxpayer, and if the names of the various indi- viduals whose deeds are in the Government safes were used instead of that of the Govern- ment or the Crown, these six millions would be reduced very largely indeed by that one item. Then, again, does not the honourable gentle- man know that a large portion of the six millions was expended in the purchase of Mr. Napier State, and which has been re-leased, and the rents from which are paying a greater sum annually than is sufficient to pay the interest on the money expended in the purchase of those estates ? We have acquired estates under the Land for Settlements Act. Was there any Land for Settlements Act in the Atkinsonian days ? If you analyse the honourable gentle- man's speech you will see that it is bristling with disingenuous statements meant to delude non-inquiring minds; and if his speech be examined and dissected it falls to the ground absolutely by the weight of the misrepresenta- tions it contains. Now, Sir, I will refer to various items in the Budget speech of the Treasurer. In the first place, I desire to con- gratulate the right honourable gentleman on the continued buoyancy of our finance and the evidence of stable prosperity which the Budget affords. If we recognise the signifi- cance of the surplus of #532,564 -- a truly mag- nificent surplus at the end of the year- I submit there is no justification for the lamentations and predictions of imminent disaster we have listened to this evening. The increase of the annual income over that of the previous year by $272,320 is an indication. I submit, of increasing prosperity ; and if we analyse the items which make up that increase we shall find that there is increased confidence in the trading community generally. I find from the headings of the various items of in- crease that the increased revenue shows this: that there was an increased spending-power on the part of the people ; that there were in- creased dealings in share stocks and in land; that the values of land have gone up; that there were larger incomes; and that there was a greater amount of travelling on the railways, both for business and for pleasure. Now, what are the elements of a people's prosperity ? Surely the people's prosperity must be gauged by the value of their posses- sions and the extent of their spending-power. and, tried by any of those tests, or all of them together, I submit the people of New Zealand are enjoying unexampled prosperity. There is apparently no risk whatever of any immediate cessation of that prosperity, or even of its serious diminution. The honourable gentle- man referred to the public debt, and to the increase of the amount of the indebtedness over that of last year. But he also upon this point was scarcely ingenuous, because he did not tell us that of the increased debt the greater proportion-well, more than half -- w.Is directly producing interest, and therefore that there was in respect of that no additional burden on the people of the colony. Over $800,000 is directly producing interest, and of the balance a large sum is indirectly producing interest and has placed a large but unascertain- able sum in the pockets of the people, because I find that of the balance over half of the in- creased indebtedness has been spent upon roads and bridges and other works of a permanent and reproductive character, using the word "permanent " in its ordinary sense. Other 
<page:651>
works which are quite legitimately charged against capital are being provided out of the other half of the increased indebtedness of last year. Consequently, if a balance - sheet was prepared, and the assets were put down on the credit side as against the £1,627,675 of the increased indebtedness since last year. we should have this result: that you would possess tangible assets for almost the whole of the money, and that there was practically no burden placed on the people by this additional indebtedness. It is therefore a cardinal error in the speech of the honourable gentleman to put down expenditure on capital works as if it were ordinary departmental expenditure, with- out taking into consideration that assets exist as against that expenditure. Supposing that a man erects a house, and that that man's in- come is $500 a year, and that during one year he erects a house worth #1,000, would it not be absolutely unfair and ridiculous to say at the end of the year, in stating that man's condi- tion and position, that he was living at a greater rate than his income justified, and that he had spent $1,000 in the year where- as his income was only £500, without taking into consideration that the house existed there instead of the £1,000-that the $1,000 had not been destroyed, but that it had merely been changed from one form of capital into another. That was the underlying fallacy of the whole of the honourable gentleman's speech when he was referring to the increased in- debtedness of the colony, and not taking into consideration the assets which have been produced by this increased expenditure. Now, referring to the expenditure in the Budget, the first item upon which I desire to make a   remark is that in connection with the Royal visit, and I am sure there will not be a single voice raised against the expenditure incurred in the reception of our illustrious guests. I be- lieve, myself, that the visit of their Royal Hichnesses to this colony will be productive of very great good to the people of this colony and to the Empire generally. It will have a tendency to work towards the consolidation of the Empire, to bring us closer to the people of Great Britain, and to weld the Empire into one homogeneous whole. Therefore, Sir, I do not think any one will cavil at the $50,000 which was expended in connection with the reception of our future King and Queen. Now, another item in the expenditure will be the increased Well, surely, Sir, the vote for education. honourable gentleman will not deny that an in- creased sum spent upon education, provided it is judiciously spent, will be money well spent --- will be reproductive expenditure in the truest sense. What has made Germany what she is to-day but the superior education of her people. And if you look to the fact that in Germany not only primary education, but secondary education and university education, is almost free to all- a thing which would be denounced in this coun- try as the rankest socialism if it were intro- duced-when you recognise that fact existing in autocratic Germany, and that it has resulted in the German nation taking its place in line with the foremost nations of the earth, I say, Sir, that if the Government go on with in- creased expenditure upon education I shall most strongly support them, and say god-speed to every effort to make the people of New Zealand an educated democracy. Now, the next item of large dimensions in the increased expenditure is that for defence, and £64,400 is the increase under the head of " Defence." I cannot think that that will meet with the condemnation of the honourable gentleman, who we know advo- cated-and I presume he was sincere-that the country should be placed in a condition of abso- lute security, and that the obsolete weapons we formerly had-the old Snider rifle and Martini- Henrys, and even the Lee-Enfields, which were not magazine rifles-should be discarded, and the most modern and up - to - date weapons should be purchased in sufficient numbers to thoroughly equip all the Volunteer Forces of the colony. Well, that has been done, and to- day we stand prepared and ready to meet any enemy that chooses to come along. We have magazine rifles and magazine carbines for the artillery companies; and, though all has not been done which must be done, I take it, with regard to placing the defences of the country upon a proper footing, yet good and steady progress has been made during the past year. I trust, however, that the report of the Secret Defence Committee will not be buried-that the effort which has been made will not be a spasmodic one, but that there will be a continuous progress, and that the right honourable gentleman, the Minister of Defence, will see that the recommendations of that Com- mittee are not treated lightly, but that, so far as the public finances will permit, the recom- mendations of the Committee will be carried into effect. There are several items in the report of the Defence Committee which I think might have been adopted, and, I hope, will be at an early date. The establishment of schools of instruction for officers is a clamant want, and I trust it will be speedily supplied. The Defence Committee reported, and the House adopted their report, that " schools of instruction should be provided for Volunteer officers at Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin." Now, Sir, those schools of instruction are not yet pro- vided ; but I believe steps have been initiated in that direction, and it will not be very long before we see those schools in active operation, and the gentlemen who devote their services gratuitously to the defence of the country will receive reasonable assistance in the way of getting instruction in the technical branches of their profession. The payment of Volunteers during camps of instruction is a step, I trust, that will be soon carried out. It is absolutely neces- sary that the Volunteers should receive daylight instruction, as I have already more than once said in this House, and the Defence Committee insisted that the only way of doing that was by having Volunteers in camps for the whole day during at least a period of seven days, and pay- ing the men a reasonable wage for their services during that period. Sir, it is true that the navy is our first line of defence ; but I maintain that. 
<page:652>
cient to justify the statesmen of this country in insisting that this colony shall be prepared to resist any invader that may embark upon the enterprise of conquering this country ; and the report recently issued by Captain Crutchley, Secretary of the Navy League, shows that the Lords of the Admiralty themselves are uneasy at the present condition of the British fleet. When the Lords of the Admiralty recently visited Malta they found a rather alarming state of affairs. They found, of course, what they should have known before they left England-that there is no breakwater there, although Malta is within 210 miles of an important torpedo-station. They found that nothing had been done for the defence of Egypt ; and it is now stated, and with authority, by one of the most eminent naval officers-a man who will probably be First Lord of the Admiralty in a few years, if not in a few months-that there is a deficiency in all classes of vessels -battle- ships and destroyers, that there is a complete absence of fleet auxiliaries, and that the fleet generally is not in an adequate state of prepara- tion for war. Well, Sir, if we receive those statements on high authority, and recognising the fact that we live by our commerce, and recognising the further fact that France and other nations are building large numbers of commerce destroyers, we must admit that the British fleet may not be in a position to convoy our commercial ships and to adequately defend this colony ; and, though I feel satisfied that if an enemy lands in this country our Volunteers would give a good account of themselves, and  that such an enemy would easily be annihilated, I would urge that the minimum requirements agreed to by the admiral of the station and the Defence Committee should as speedily   as possible be fulfilled. Now, Sir, another item of expenditure is that of the Agricul- tural Department, and I submit that that also was an expenditure which may be regarded as reproductive, because if we educate our farmers the increased knowledge must neces- sarily result in increased production. In re- ferring to the railways, I have dealt with the remarks of the honourable gentleman with regard to the alleged excessive expenditure in proportion to the income received ; and I would point out one or two salient features of the Budget which I think ought to bring home to the minds of the settlers generally the excellent manner in which the railways are now being ad- ministered. In the year 1894-95, the railways carried 3,905,578 passengers, while during last year they carried 6,243,593 passengers. During the last six years the revenue-producing power of the railways has increased by no less a sum than $576,385. Those facts, I submit, are a sure indication of the general prosperity of the country. I shall also support the Government in their proposal to introduce a system of cool-storage, and also in the chartering of vessels to develop external trade. The honourable gentleman passed lightly over these items, but I feel quite satisfied that if the Conservative party were to come into Mr. Napier . external trade, just as their former tenure of office resulted in a paralysis with regard to land settlement. The San Francisco mail-service is referred to in the Budget, but not in as emphatic terms as I would like to see it alluded to. There is no doubt that that service is the best for com- mercial purposes, and the most economical of any of the mail-services of the colonies, and I trust some practical proposals will be submitted to the House for insuring the permanency of that service. The right honourable gentleman will have noticed that an effort is being made by the people in Queensland to divert the steamers to Queensland direct, and I submit that that would involve, necessarily, the cut- ting-out of New Zealand. I trust that no such calamity will be permitted. Then, there is one paragraph in the Budget speech which I do not quite understand, and that is with reference to trade with the annexed islands. Now, as far as the islands which have 9.30. been annexed to New Zealand are con- cerned, they are now provinces of New Zealand. They are just as much a province of this colony as Canterbury or Auckland is, and the laws of New Zealand apply to them just the same as they apply to any city in the colony. To suggest, therefore, that goods from one province going into another province of New Zealand should be subjected to continued Customs imposts is a suggestion that I do not agree with. I submit that the products of New Zealand should now be allowed to go into the islands free, because they are a part of the colony. It must neces- sarily be so. I do not see how one province can set up a system of taxation against another province, and I hope that the laws of those is- lands, such as they are, are being adjusted. We ought to give those laws an overhauling at as early a date as possible in this House. I trust everybody will now recognise that the islands are part of the colony, and that the laws of New Zealand shall apply to them as well as to other parts of the colony. I notice with satis- faction that the ordinary expenditure on public works was greater than that of the previous year by £350,000. That is satisfactory. I hope that, instead of crying a halt in the public works policy, as suggested by the honourable member for Hawke's Bay, it will go on at an accelerated pace. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- What, at 4 per cent. ? Mr. NAPIER .- I am pleased that the Trea- surer has placed the construction of the North Island Trunk line in the category of national works of the first rank. I think the House is unanimous with him on that point. Members from the North and the South are all agreed that the North Island Trunk Railway is a national work, and therefore that there should be no hesitation in proceeding with its construction as fast as finance will allow. I submit that the viaducts should be got ready as soon as possible, so that we will not have to wait on the forma- tion, and that when the formation is sufficiently advanced the viaducts ought to be ready to be erected, so that the time for opening the line will be in accordance with the promise 
<page:653>
given. We ought to have the track completed | land has been a terra incognita to southern right through the Waimarino Forest, on the southern side of the Wanganui River, before the termination of next summer. That, I trust, will be done. I do not anticipate that there will be any difficulty this session in placing on the list of authorised railways the Whanga- momona-Kawakawa Railway, as it is the Strat- ford route connecting Taranaki with Auckland. I trust that the work of constructing this line from the Stratford end towards Whanga- momona will be expedited, because it is a most important arterial line. An immense terri- tory of a fertile character will be opened up by it : the opening of that railway and the roads to feed it will practically add another province to New Zealand. The land - for - settlements policy has made vigorous progress during the year ; but I note with some surprise and with mixed feelings that, though 70,833 acres were purchased during the year, at a total cost of $350,193, not a single acre was purchased in the Province of Auckland. It is true that during the previous year the Government had purchased estates there, and I am not disposed to censure them now, as the work of settlement in other provinces was very urgent. I would, however, again direct attention to the enormous properties that the Assets Board hold in the Waikato, which ought to be resumed as speedily as possible and settled. Sir, in this connection I learnt a most astonishing thing  32106019788246 within the last few days-that this Assets Board, so far from wishing to divest itself of its functions and to commit "the happy despatch " as early as possible, is actually negotiating for   renewals of leases of lands from the Natives for forty-two years at Whakatane, on the East Coast. Do the members of that Board suppose that they are going to be allowed to exist for another forty-two years- that the country will for long tolerate such a scandal as the con- tinued existence of that Board ? I trust, Sir, they will be stopped. Some of the settlers have written indignantly to me that their efforts to get leases from the Natives there are hampered by this Board, which is endea- vouring to get renewals of the existing leases, which are about to expire. Sir, the settle- ment of the Assets Board estates in the Wai- kato will not interfere with the settlement of the King-country. Married men with large families could not go out into the wilderness to act as pioneers ; let that be done by young men. But lands nearer schools, roads, and rail- ways ought to be settled by married men with families. and numbers of these are ready to take them up if the lands are cut up into small farms. There are also large areas in North Auckland which could be settled for growing not only ordinary farm produce, but a large number of sub - tropical products. Canning - factories for fruit and schools for the teaching of sub- tropical agriculture are essential for the de- velopment of that part of the country. I trust also that the Northern Railway, for the com- pletion of which scores of petitions have been presented to the House this session, will not be neglected. The northernmost part of New Zea- members, but it is a valuable province in area and in the extent of its fertile valleys. The Minister of Lands during the year has done good work in visiting the North and making a detailed inspection of the various districts, and I was pleased to notice the great interest that he took in the struggling settlers of the North, and I feel satisfied from the knowledge he has gained that good work will result to the colony in future years. Sir, the honourable gentleman, in his concluding remarks, referred to the Government as harassing every industry. The sentence was somewhat similar to that with which Lord Beaconsfield once went to the country. The concluding sentence of Lord Beaconsfield's letter to the Duke of Marl- borough, I think, was almost in the exact words used by the honourable member to-night. Captain RUSSELL .- He won the election, too. Mr. NAPIER .- Why, Sir, the election of 1880 is a red-letter day in the history of Liberalism in Great Britain. The Liberals established the Eighty Club to commemorate the victory, when they secured a majority of 130. The honourable gentleman termed the Government socialists. Well, I will give him the opinion of a pronounced Tory. a gentle- man who was allied with an ancient and noble family, a man of science, a man who had little sympathy with the Liberal party in the Old Country, but for whose opinions and scientific writings I have the greatest respect. I refer to Professor Huxley. This is what he says, and I think it will be a reply to remarks in the strain to which I have referred. He says,- " I am unable to see that civil society is any- thing but a corporation established for a moral object-namely, the good of its members-and therefore that it may take such measures as seem fitting for the attainment of that which the general voice decides to be for the general good." Now, Sir, the honourable gentleman, with his extreme individualism, which, as Carlyle tells us, is simply "Anarchy plus a policeman." would have us abandon all the policy for the general good that has been introduced during the last ten years and run the country on the lines of a joint-stock company, and make the largest dividends possible out of the public ser- vices in order to relieve the large landholders from taxation. Sir, I desire to make one or two remarks with regard to the Justice Depart- ment. The Justice Department is carefully and capably administered at present by the Hon. the Minister in charge of the depart- ment ; but he is, of course, not an expert, and what I regret to say is, that in the successive Liberal Administrations since 1890 there has been a lack of initiative in the Justice Depart- ment. Our laws-that is to say, referring more particularly to procedure and to other branches of the law-are not as advanced as they ought to be. Our Courts -- the doors of our Courts are not as widely open as they should be. According to Magna Charta, justice should be speedy, and 
<page:654>
should not be bought or sold ; it should be available to all-to every man. It is not so in this colony. The Supreme Court is practically a Court for the well-to do. It is virtually im- possible for a man to get justice in the Supreme Court at the present time unless he has con- siderable means. The Judges, of course, are above suspicion ; the machinery is all right. We have as our Judiciary men of talent, men well read in the law; but it is the system, which has remained unaltered for nineteen years, and which still has many of the attri- butes of a former epoch. What is called the " New Code " was adopted in 1882, and is now archaic in many respects. I should like to see either a Commission of experts appointed, or by some other means an effort made to bring our Supreme Court procedure more into har- mony with modern ideas. Then, again, the management of our prisons is, I think, some- what defective, and is behind the age. notice in the report of the Inspector of Prisons that he says, "My time has, as usual, been fully occupied in periodically visiting the dif ferent prisons of the colony." Well, if the In- spector is occupied in travelling and inspecting the prisons he has no time for initiating re- forms, and he is practically the only officer upon whom devolves the function of thinking out any question of prison management and prison discipline. The prisons require attention. There , is unfortunately, if I may use the term, a large clientelle for the prisons. Five hundred and thirty prisoners is the daily average population of the prisons, though I rejoice to see that there  is a decrease in the number of prisoners during the year of 7-74 males, but regrettably an in- crease of women prisoners of 0.19. Yet nothing practically is done in the way of initiating a     system of classification or a system of reform. Punishment alone, vindictive punishment alone -the old principle, and now largely exploded- is still the dominating feature in our prison system. The reform of the offender is not thought of. I would like to see an effort made to bring in, partially perhaps, the methods of the Elmira Reformatory, of America, which has been attended with astoundingly suc- cessful results in the treatment of crime. Sir, in that reformatory during the last ten years 83.1 per cent. of the number of prisoners committed were reformed. The prisoners in the reformatory, when discharged, are watched throughout their career. This is done, however, unknown to themselves. There is no system of espionage. And the number rescued from crime totalled 83 per cent. of the offenders. Now, that is a magnificent success, and I trust some effort will be made to intro- duce into some portion, at all events, of the prison system some of the features of the re- formatory of Elmira. A writer on the refor matory of Elmira, Mr. Alexander Winter, F.S.S., says in his book,- " With the communications reaching the institution from the discharged prisoners them- selves, or from their relations, employers, friends, &c., giving evidence of undoubted change, reform, and conversion, and expressing Mr. Napier thanks and acknowledgments, one might indeed fill volumes." Now, if that be so, I submit it would be well worth while to make a trial of the system in this country. The honourable member for Hawke's Bay also said that in looking at the  future there were clouds ahead, and, with the competition of America and the Argentine, we should look forward with some misgiving to the future. I have no misgivings whatever with regard to the future of our country. I have taken some pains to make myself acquainted with the whole question of the possible results of competition with New Zealand products by America and the Argentine, and, Sir, without 1 quoting any works on the subject which I could have done, as time will not permit, I will refer the honourable gentleman, so far as the United States are concerned, to a book in the library called " Our Foes at Home." I Captain RUSSELL .- Will the honourable gentleman pardon me? I did not speak of America in that connection at all ; it was with reference to the Premier's establishing freezing- works at Home. Mr. NAPIER .- I understood the honourable gentleman to refer to the possible competition of the Argentine with our produce. Captain RUSSELL .- Only as controlling the output. Mr. NAPIER .- Precisely. If the honourable gentleman will refer to the recent books on the subject in the library he will see we have very little to fear from either North or South America. Time will not permit of my entering on another subject, as I have only two minutes now remain- ing; but I would submit that the Budget dis- closes abundant evidence, which he who runs may read, not only of the present prosperity of the colony, but also of a prosperity which, as far as human foresight can discover, is likely to con- tinue. I cannot see any clouds ahead at all ; . there is no cloud ahead even as large as a man's hand. This article of produce may rise and that article may fall, but New Zealand does not rest on any single production. Our products are varied. A gentleman told me the other day that though he had lost very considerably on his wool-clip during the year, yet the profit be made on his lambs had more than compensated for the loss on his wool. Under these circum- stances I cannot agree that there is anything to regret in our policy, or that there is any warn- ing to give to the people other than that I have given them-to beware of the honourable gentie- man and all his works. The sun of this colony is high in the firmament. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- Time is up. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce). - The honourable gentleman who has just spoken is a lawyer, and one would have expected from a lawyer that be would have analysed the words used by the Premier more carefully than he did. He told the House in the course of his speech that the Premier denied the statement he is reported to have used to a deputation of West Coast mem- bers. If the honourable gentleman had. lawyer- like, been more careful he would not have said so ; what he should have said was that the 
<page:655>
Premier remarked he was reported to have said so, and never yet has the Right Hon. the Pre- mier said that the report was incorrect. But, lawyer-like, later on he attempted to trip up the member for Hawke's Bay in a misquotation -and I suppose this is characteristic of lawyers also-namely, that he immediately afterwards fell into such an error himself, and in the same passage, for he quoted the member for Hawke's Bay as having said that, " If ever the time arrives when increased taxation is required to meet the ordinary expenditure, so surely will reductions in salaries eventuate ; " and he stopped there. Why did he stop? He accused the member for Hawke's Bay of leav- ing out part of the quotation, and immediately he did the same. I will finish it for him: "To avoid the contingency, and the injustice which arose in the past, it is well for those having responsibility to do their utmost to keep down expenditure." What is the meaning of this passage, if it has any meaning at all ? There is only one possible meaning-namely, that unless expenditure is kept down the salaries will have to be reduced. Then, Sir, the honour- able gentleman, later on in his speech, accused those who were in power from 1884 to 1887 of having cut down the salaries. It is admitted that the salaries were cut down, and the necessities which the Right Hon. the Premier is himself now pointing out-the necessities at that time caused the salaries to be cut down because the colony had got into such a condition of finance  that it could not pay the salaries it had been paying. And, Sir, the cutting-down of salaries came not alone from those who were then sitting on the Ministerial benches, but from Mr. Bal- lance and his own supporters, who were then in opposition, but assisting Sir Harry Atkinson to cut down the salaries. With regard to the ques- tion of ability, the honourable gentleman said that those who are so-called Liberals have always been ready and willing to pay for ability ; and I ask him, or any other member of Parliament, to go over the long, long list of able men who have gone out of this colony during the last ten years because the colony would not pay them a salary proportionate to their ability. I could start that long list and carry it on until I came down to perhaps the best and most able officer we have had in the Railway service - Mr. Hudson. And there sits the Minister for Railways, and he knows as well as any other member of the House that Mr. Hudson, who was the mainstay of his railway system, was allowed to go because he would not pay him an adequate salary. Surely this is suffi- cient answer to the honourable gentleman's argument that the Liberal party tries to keep men who are able by paying them good salaries. And then the honourable gentleman said that the honourable member for Hawke's Bay had accused the Right Hon. the Premier of bribery, and he said he did not know of such a thing taking place in New Zealand. I am afraid the honourable gentleman's political education has been neglected, or else that he will not see what his eyes will easily let him see if he only uses them. It has been only too common a practice, and many members of the House are well ac- quainted with the fact that open bribery has taken place. I refer, not to those indirect bribes which the Premier so often tries of this nature : Starting away into a constituency, as he often does, meeting there the electors of that constituency and saying, as he has said to them, " Do you expect any support from me, any financial aid from me, unless you give me something in return?" Is not that bribery ? I do not know what it is if it is not bribery. Then, I can quote other instances in which, for certain local public works, some dis- tricts have received the whole of the money required for those works. Take, for instance, the Otaki Bridge. In this case there was re- ceived from the Government the whole of the money to erect that bridge ; but when other members go and ask for some assistance for a bridge to be re-erected or built in their dis- tricts they are told-what ? That it can be done only on the condition that the districts find half the money. Did Otaki find half the money ? I recollect a few years ago that this House was confronted with so patent a bribe that they cut that bribe out of the estimates. I refer to a vote-I forget how much it was- that was put down for a Mr. McKeague, who proposed to be a Government candidate at the next election. On the estimates a vote was put down for a work on irrigation by this Mr. McKeague, and that vote was cut out of the estimates by the House. Mr. HALL-JONES. - And was voted next year. Mr. J. ALLEN .- Yes, Sir; and why? Be- cause the Ministry were strong enough to make the House vote it. The House cut it out, as I say, and the Minister paid it without the au- thority of the House, and then with their strong majority they got it voted. Sir J. G. WARD .- I understand McKeague did not stand as a candidate. Mr. PIRANI. - Oh, yes, he did. Mr. J. ALLEN .- Then, Sir, I look to this year, and I come across an item the honour- able member for Wanganui will be interested in. I am sorry he is not in the Chamber just now. I see a vote down for a Wanganui steamer, and I understand the story to be told about the Wanganui River steamers is this-perhaps the honourable member who has recently joined the House, Mr. Haselden, member for Patea, will be able to confirm what I say : that a subsidy for conveyance of mails, without any tenders being called for was given to Mr. Hatrick, who owned one line of steamers ; that an election was coming off; and that the owners of the other line of steamers which runs upon the Wanganui River, and in which a large number of settlers are interested, were grievously dis- appointed because no tenders were called for the carriage of mails on the Wanganui River, and they insisted upon it that a wrong had been done. To put the matter right, what happened ? A subsidy was given to these steamers as well. Now the Wanganui River is in a happy condition of having a subsidy for Hatrick's steamers and a subsidy for the 
<page:656>
other steamers as well, and no tenders were | called for the conveyance of the mails. If that is not a bribe in view of the election that was coming off, then I do not know what a bribe is. And then. Sir, I was interested in the remark the honourable member made that wool is not a staple industry. I am sure the honour- able gentleman has not been looking at the statistics of the colony ; or if he has, he has not been using his legal acumen and the ability which a lawyer generally uses- Mr. NAPIER .- I said "not the chief staple industry." Mr. J. ALLEN .- The honourable member said, no longer a staple industry. Then he ! went on to say that shortly butter and meat ! have been taken out of the revenue, as they are would be the staple industry. I thought of meat, and I realised that meat meant to a very large extent "sheep." I wondered what became of the wool on the back of these sheep, and I realised that the honourable gentleman was actually only playing with language. And then, Sir, he introduced to us the new doctrine of the American railways. The American rail- ways, so he says, according to the very latest authorities - which are the books out of the library -are not to be run in the interests of the pockets of those who own them, but in the interests of the community generally. And I thought of all these railway kings, and I wondered how they got their pockets so lined with millions in the interests of the com- munity. And shortly afterwards the honour- able gentleman answered the statement him- self, when he quoted Jay Gould. When Jay Gould was asked if he would run these rail- ways in the interests of the community Jay Gould answered, " What, run the railways in the interests of the people? I have contempt for the people, and respect only the lining of my own pocket "; or words to that effect, and I think that is the very principle on which the American railways are run. I do not say it is a principle which we ought to encourage in New Zealand. I believe the railways belong- ing to the State should be run in the interests of the State, and of those who live here. And then, Sir, the honourable gentleman had a few words to say about the surplus. Well, of course, I think here, too, he did not use that care which he ought to have used. He quoted the surplus as given in the Financial Statement, and I presume he is acquainted with the manner of keeping books ; and, if he is, one would have expected him to put before the House a fair statement of what the surplus really was. Does the honourable gentleman include the liabilities, or the excess of liabilities, of this year over the last, or has he left them out altogether? He is a lawyer and book-keeper, and he knows perfectly well that the balance of liabilities now remaining over last year's liability ought to have been taken off the surplus, and he did not do it. He says the honourable member for Hawke's Bay misquotes ; but the honour- able member himself misquoted the surplus, and also the quotation made by the honour- able member for Hawke's Bay. Sir, the surplus is not what the honourable member represents Mr. J. Allen it to be, not by an ordinary means of  10.0. book-keeping ; and he should have taken off that surplus the sum of $70,000, the excess of liabilities of this year over last year, in order to have made a fair approximation of the sur- plus. He ought to have told the colony too- it ought to be told, time and time again-that on the revenue side of our accounts we include. and have included year after year-wrongfuliy. I say-our capital. We have been getting rid of our lands for cash and for deferred payment. and have been raising loans to pay the sinking fund, and all the moneys have gone to the revenue side of the account, and in any honest system of book-keeping those things ought to simply loan-moneys or capital that is gradually dwindling away. The honourable gentleman also says the land-values have gone up. We know they have. Times have been fairly good for the last few years. But why have the values gone up to the extent we see? The honourable gentleman knows, because he is interested in the Valuation Department as connected with the Advances to Settlers Department. He is interested as a lawyer. He knows, no doubt, the instructions that were sent round to the land valuers to run up the value of the land in every district where they possibly could to the highest point. The valuers carried out the instructions, and there is no doubt that was mainly the reason why values of land have gone up as much as they have. It is an easy matter to simply add a hundred or two to the valuation of any property in your books. That, however, is not a fair way to estimate the increase of the value of the land. Then, the honourable gentleman had a few words to say about the Cook Islands and, I think, Rarotonga, and he was objecting to the fact that Customs duties were charged on New Zealand imports into these islands that have lately been annexed to New Zealand. Customs duties are, I believe, charged-some- where about 10 per cent. against New Zealand. whilst the Australian Colonies have to pay the ordinary Customs duties. But, Sir. I had hoped, when he was touching on the Cook Islands and New Zealand, he would have given us his opinion about New Zealand's manage- It is interesting to ment of these groups. notice, for instance, in this evening's paper that in Rarotonga the Government officials have embezzled $800 or $900 of the money, one of them being the nephew of the gentleman who is in charge at Rarotonga, and this gentle- man has had to pay $500 out of his own pocke: to clear the man, who is reported to have been drunk and to have cleared out with the money. That is a curious instance of how New Zealand is managing these islands. Mr. HALL-JONES .- That was before the annexation. Mr. J. ALLEN .- The honourable gentleman is quite wrong. This was done quite recent ... Then, Sir, the honourable gentleman went or to speak about the settlement of the land. Hr says that great progress was made during the year. Perhaps great progress has been made 
<page:657>
honourable gentleman was speaking on that subject that he would have examined more closely into some of the details of the land-for- settlements policy for the year. I am going to touch on only one point, and I will ask the honourable gentleman's consideration of it. We passed a law last year, or the year before, permitting the Government to buy land for workmen's homes, and under that law the Government have purchased land for work- men's homes. I will refer to one purchase near Wellington. It is in the Hutt Valley. It is called Epuni. It is three or four miles away from a railway-station. It is not a convenient place for workmen's homes. It has been pur- chased at a price of £90 per acre. The value of the land for taxation purposes is $55. The real value of the land is $65, and the Government have paid $90 an acre for it. It was put up for settlement purposes. I think there were forty-three allotments, and up to a little time ago only sixteen of them had been taken up. I do not want to return to the question of bribery, but I should like to know the history of this Epuni Settlement. I should like to know whether any member of the House has been interested in that settlement. . I have my sus- picions, and I think that this transaction re- quires inquiring into, just as did Pomahaka. that is to be the class of land acquired for work- men's homes I am sorry for the scheme. I understood that land for workmen's homes was to be bought so near to the railway that it would be convenient for the men going to and from their work. This property is not suitable for workmen's homes; and if the honourable mem- ber for Masterton were here just now I would ask him what he had to say about the Epuni Settlement when speaking at the Land Board meeting the other day. If the honourable member for Auckland City (Mr. Napier) had examined closely the land -settlement scheme of last year he would not have been so strong in his praises of it. He spoke of the Whakatane leases of the Assets Board. At first I wondered who it was that was speaking so strongly on this point. Why, he should approach his leader, the Premier, for that honourable gentleman is the member of the Assets Board. Why does the honourable member not lay his grievances before him? I will now return to the Financial Statement. The honourable member for Hawke's Bay referred to the re- marks that the Premier is reported to have made to the deputation that came from the West Coast. I believe he did make those re- marks. I believe it, Sir, not only because of the reports of the newspapers, but because the whole Financial Statement bears out ex- actly what the Premier said. Let me quote a few words of the Financial Statement with regard to the position of the Consolidated Fund Account. On page ii., when dealing with the question of prudence and economy-and here I would remark that all through the Statement there is a cry for prudence and a cry for economy, both in connection with the Consoli- dated Fund and the Public Works Fund. I VOL. CXVII .- 41. for instance, the Treasurer says there is an "absolute necessity for prudence and economy ;" and on the same page he adds, " there should be a jealously guarded expenditure, for a re- stricted population can only bear a limited and reasonable impost of taxation." And, again : " the national expenditure should be cut down to the lowest limit consistent with efficiency, after providing for the necessary requirements." And on page iii. he says :- "If ever the time arrives when increased taxation is required to meet the ordinary ex- penditure, so surely will reductions in salaries eventuate. To avoid the contingency, and the injustice which arose in the past, it is well for those having responsibility to do their utmost to keep down expenditure.' On page xvii., "The estimates have been kept down to the lowest limit "; on page xviii. he says, "I have no desire to be pessimistic, but one cannot be too cautious while framing the estimates for the year." Then, he says, on page xxiv., "With care and economy, it is rea- sonable to expect that there will be a fair surplus next year." Sir, the answer to these hollow shams-for they are hollow shams-is to be found on page xvii. of the Financial State- ment, where we find that the Right Hon. the If Premier, as Treasurer, says this : "There is a proposed increase over last year's expenditure of $284,111." And the significance of this increase does not come out till we begin to examine somewhat into the details. And then what does one find? I have no time to deal with last year's increases, but, over and above last year's increases, there are these which are in the estimates for this coming year. An in- crease of $73,609 in the payment of interest; and the honourable gentleman who has just sat down said that the bulk of these loans which have been raised have been for revenue pro- ducing purposes, and that they earn enough interest to pay for the interest upon the loan. Is that true, in face of the fact that upon this year's estimates $73,000 is set down for in- creased interest on loan-moneys ? Mr. HALL-JONES .- Where is the interest ? It is being earned, and it is the interest- earning investments which pay for this interest. Mr. NAPIER .- It is credited on the other side, which amounts to the same thing. Mr. J. ALLEN .- Oh, no; he is absolutely wrong. He knows no more about it than does the book before him. The interest earned by the revenue producing departments, such as that for advances to settlers and the land for settle- ments, and the interest payable on account of the loans for these purposes, is apart from these accounts, and does not appear on either side. Honourable members will find this interest deducted from the general interest charges on page 6 of the estimates. Then, Sir, with regard to the old-age pensions, we find an increase of some £18,000 but I will have something to say about old-age pensions later on. I could go through a whole list of these increases-new departments formed -Industries and Commerce, Tourists ; visit of their Royal Highnesses; 
<page:658>
inebriates' homes, increases to the railway | public works and conveniences has forced salaries over and above the classification-over and above the maximum classification by £21,000; increases in the Valuation Depart- ment-about which we were told a few years ago that it would only cost us this large sum for a few years, and then the cost would nearly disappear from off the estimates, and yet there is this further increase over last year. Then, Sir, there is this item : "Copies of Review of Reviews, £260." What in the world for ? Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER. - I am sorry to interrupt the honourable gentleman, but the rule is that in discussing the motion to go into Committee of Supply the separate items are not to be discussed. They are discussed in Com- mittee of Supply. Mr. J. ALLEN .- Your ruling is a curious one, but in deference to it I will not discuss the items. As I cannot discuss the items, I will come to what every honourable member must have noticed in the estimates, and that is the general increases allowed on the high salaries. I will defy any one to look through these esti- mates and find that the Premier has put into practice what he has preached about prudence and economy. I defy you to find any single item-of economy, prudence, or reduction of expenses. On the contrary, you will find almost every item increased, and notably increases of £25, £50, and in some cases £100 in the high salaries. Sir, that is the way they practise prudence. They talk about it, they preach about it, and they are the ones who years ago used to preach, and practise too, the cutting- down of the high salaries and the raising-up of  the low ones. Now we find that they are the very ones who are increasing the high salaries. And now, Sir, when we come to examine the accounts of the June quarter, to see whether the prudence, and economy, and care which has been preached in one part of the Statement is being practised, we find that in the first quarter of the current year there is an increased expenditure over the similar quarter of the previous year on the permanent and annual appropriations of close upon £150,000 ; and yet we have preached to us that we ought to practise prudence and economy. Then, we find that in the quarter the excess of expenditure over receipts is no less than £362,936. I admit this quarter does often show an excess of ex- penditure over receipts, but never so much as this year. Last year the excess was £155,000 ; this year it is $362,000, an increase in the excess of expenditure over revenue of no less than £207,000, and this after preaching the necessity of prudence and economy.' And now I come to the Public Works Fund, and this, to my mind, is a more serious matter than the Consolidated Fund. The same preaching occurs all through the Statement as to the necessity for prudence, for cutting down expenditure, and for decreasing the borrowing. On page ii. we find that the Treasurer says, "The eager and pressing desire for the rapid construction of Mr. J. Allen borrowing up to a limit beyond which it would not be safe to go." On page iii., "The increased ratio of population is much below that of the increased ordinary expenditure. For every million borrowed and expended on non-revenue-producing works and objects an annual charge of about 10d. a head is entailed upon every European man, woman, and child in the colony." Then, on page xxiii., "The time is most inopportune for extensive borrow- ing." On the same page, "Certainly the greatest care and economy will require to be exercised by myself and my colleagues to keep the public-works expenditure within the ways and means." Then, on page xxiv., he says. "There should be a tapering off rather than an increased borrowing as compared with last year." And on page xxvi.," I advise, and that in good faith, that at the present time the good steamer "Finance" should be steadied, and that "Slow," and not " Full speed ahead," should be the order on the dial." And how does he pro- pose to go slow? On page xxiii. he says, " We estimate that there will be an expenditure of about £1,950,000 on public works." And that is the way he goes slow. During the last two or three years our expenditure on public works has increased very largely. From 1900 to 1901 the increased expenditure was £342,752, and the estimated increase in expenditure for 1901-2 is £642,489. And that is the way the Premier pro- poses to go slow, and to steady the good steamer "Finance." Sir, when we come to examine the account for the last quarter we find the ex-  penditure on public works to have been £417.213, as against £151,640 for the June quarter of the previous year-an increased expenditure of a very, very large amount, and that at a time when he is preaching to us prudence. economy, and going slow. We find that the balance available for public works on the 30th June last was only £686,000. And now, let me 1 come to this question-before, however, doing that I would like to point out the increased public debt during the last ten years -- the net debt has increased during the last ten years by £11,213,828. What have we to say now about the borrowing limit beyond which it is not safe to go ? The Premier preaches exceed- ingly well, but we find that the Premier very seldom practises what he preaches. This bor- rowing question is one the colony will have to face. We have come to rely now so much upon borrowed money that any check-either in the London market or here-in convenience of borrowing throws us upon our haunches at once. And we are being thrown very nearly on our haunches now, for we cannot face the London market at any reasonable price ; and the Premier talks about exploiting New Zealand and Aus- tralia. Before I come to the question of ex- ploiting New Zealand and Australia I should like to point out what the borrowing has been in the last ten years, and for that purpose I have prepared the following table :-

I wish to run over the total to show how borrowing has been growing on us, and how borrowing departments have been increasing like a disease that we never seem to get rid of. In 1891 the actual borrowing for the year, in- cluding the debentures for sinking funds, was only $363,000, and this sum has gone on increas- ing, as shown in the table, till last year it amounted to a million and three-quarters, and a total in the eleven years of $12,649,233, or, for the ten years since Sir Harry Atkinson went out of office, $12,286,233. Mr. SEDDON .- What was the amount for the ten years before that ? Mr. J. ALLEN .- I am not going to bother with that now, but it was nothing like that. $12,286,233 has actually been paid into the coffers of the various departments during the last ten years, and the Premier knows it is time for him to consider whether the policy of heavy borrowing is to continue. It may be right when the markets are good, but when the money-markets fall our whole scheme of finance comes down like a broken reed. Now I come to what, to my mind, is the most serious thing in the whole Budget. The Premier has said, and everybody will agree with him, that the colony should keep the public works expendi- ture within ways and means. Mr. SEDDON .- Hear, hear. Mr. J. ALLEN .- The Premier says "Hear, hear." The total ways and means he had for 1900-1901 were, as recorded on page viii. of the Financial Statenent of 1900 :- £ Cash in hand 139,749 .. Available out of loan 700,000 .. From Consolidated Fund .. 500,000 .. 1,339,749 In addition, the loan granted last 1,000,000 year . . .. Total available ways and means up to 31st March, 1901 2,339,749 And the appropriations from 1900-1 2,196,365 were . . Leaving available ways and means on the 31st March, 1901 £143,384 That available balance we did not have, and I do not know if in the history of the colony it has before occurred that at the end of the financial year the colony had no ways and means to meet its responsibilities. The ex- penditure during the year was $1,307,511, and the liabilities at the end of the year were $1,292,096. The total expenditure and liabili- ties come to £2,599,607, and, as I said just now, the total ways and means available was only €2,339,749, leaving a deficiency at the 31st March last of close on £260,000. Mr. SEDDON .- Why do you not say that is Public Works Fund ? Mr. J. ALLEN .- It is Public Works Fund. There was no money provided in ways and means on the 31st March last to meet our liabilities. We were short of ways and means Mr. J. Allen by £260,000. Now, I ask the Premier, and I ask the colony Mr. SEDDON .- I had a $500,000 surplus. Mr. J. ALLEN .- " $500,000 surplus ! " Yes; the honourable gentleman had transferred $500,000 from the Consolidated Fund to the Public Works Fund during the year 1930-01, and I have given him credit for that. He said he had $500,000 of surplus at the 31st March, 1001, and I know he had. He had no authority to transfer this surplus to Public Works Fund, and it did not on the 31st March last form part of the ways and means of the Public Works Fund. The point is this : that he incurred liabilities without having the money to meet them. It is not honest to do it, and it has been done this year for the first time, so far as I know, in the history of the colony. I regret that it should be so, and I am quite certain it will not add to the facilities we require for borrowing money in London or elsewhere. In other words, I may place the matter in this way: Our liabilities on the 31st March were £1,292,096, and to meet these liabilities we had only available the balance in the Public Works Fund of £232,515 and an unraised loan of £800.000, making together $1,032,515, leaving, altogether, a deficiency of close on €260,000. We have entered into liabilities that the honourable gentleman had no right to incur, and no money to meet. Would any tradesman do that sort of thing without know- ing where the money was to come from to pay for liabilities he was incurring? I come now to page xxiii. of the Statement, in which the Premier says, " In endeavouring to bring our borrowing within reasonable limits, consider- able difficulty has been encountered, owing to the heavy expenditure and liabilities which have been incurred during the last four months "-that is to say, since the 31st Sir, as I say, there was £1.292.006 March. of liabilities, and there was a shortage of i £260,000 of ways and means to meet these liabilities on the 31st March: and the Premier in his Statement says the position is worse still four months later. I should like to see the accounts for the four months, and see what the expenditure and liabilities were, and what were the ways and means. I accuse the Premier of leading the colony into debt without having provided the money to pay those debts. Then I come to the question of loan-money required during the current year. The Premier says in his Statement, "I have some misgiving as to the amount to be asked for which will be suffi- cient to carry us on until next session." And well he may have doubts, as to how much to ask for to carry on till next session, as I nud his balance of Public Works Fund on the 31st March, 1901, was only $232,515, and there is the unraised balance of loan of $800.000, and the $500,000 in the Consolidated Fund, which he will transfer, and he proposes a new loan of one million, making a total ways and means of $2,532,515, and he estimates public works expenditure at $1,950,000, leaving a balance of ways and means on the 31st March, 1902, of £582,515 to meet all liabilities. 1 ask honour- 
<page:661>
able gentlemen, in view of what the liabilities | have been for the last few years, whether they imagine for a moment our liabilities on Public Works Fund on the 31st March, 1902, will be under £600,000. Even with his new loan of a million, and with his transfer of $500,000 from the Consolidated Fund, he is not providing ways and means to meet his expenditure and liabilities of the coming year, if there is any faith to be placed in his statement that £1,950,000 is to be the expenditure of the year. Mr. SEDDON .- I could have borrowed that £800,000 on the 31st March. Mr. J. ALLEN .- I told you that, and have included it; but I do not want to be inter- rupted now. Now, Sir, I come to the question of the borrowing-powers the Treasurer has, and I find they are enormous. Honourable mem- bers will perhaps be surprised, and I think the country will be surprised, to know that the Treasurer has, by balances available and by loans which he is authorised to raise, if he passes his million loan for public works and his million loan for advances to settlers, available during the coming year no less than five mil- lions of money. Mr SEDDON .- No. Mr. J. ALLEN .- If he does not believe it I will give him the details. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER said that, 10.30. in accordance with the order of the House, he must interrupt the honourable gentleman, as this was one of the nights when the House must adjourn at half-past ten.  Mr. HALL - JONES (Minister for Public Works) moved the adjournment of the debate. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER said he must rule that the motion to adjourn the debate was out of order. By the order of the House the debate was interrupted, and the honourable member for Bruce would be entitled to resume the de- bate when the order was, on next sitting-day, again called on. The only motion he could now receive was one for the adjournment of the House. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said, in accordance with Mr. Deputy-Speaker's direction, he would move the adjournment of the House, and thus conform to the ruling of the Chair. He argued before that this Standing Order should be treated the same as the Standing Order which said that on a Saturday night at midnight the Speaker simply left the Chair, and went to work again at the same business at the next meeting of the House. That was what he con- tended ; but he was over ruled. He conformed to the ruling of the Chair now, and the Order Paper would commence on Tuesday, not with the interrupted debate at half-past ten, but with the orders of the day, as the Government liked to fix them. The House adjourned at twenty-five minutes to eleven o'clock p.m. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. Tuesday, 27th August, 1901. The late Hon. J. Kerr. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER took the chair at half-past ten o'clock. PRAYERS. THE LATE HON. J. KERR. Sir J. G. WARD (Colonial Secretary) .- Mr. Speaker, the duty devolves upon me of moving a resolution, out of respect to the memory of the Hon. James Kerr, and in doing so I would like to say that that honourable gentleman has been nine years a most esteemed member of the. Legislative Council. As honourable members know, he left Wellington a few days ago, and last Sunday, on his way to Greymouth, he passed to his last rest under circumstances of a somewhat pathetic character. When he left here he appeared to be in his usual condition of health, and went away in a very cheerful mood. However, on the passage he contracted an illness which has, unhappily, proved fatal. The late Hon. Mr. Kerr has been a truly repre- sentative man. In the district to which he belonged he has served on a number of the local bodies - the Harbour Board, the Edu- cation Board, the Hospital Trustees, and on other public bodies. He has also, as many members of the House know, been the pro- prietor of one of the journals published at Greymouth for a considerable period. It is to his credit that he has worked himself up from a subordinate position in newspaper life to that of a newspaper-proprietor, as well as a member of the Legislative Council. No doubt it was largely due to the experience which he gained as a Pressman, and to his knowledge gained upon local bodies, that he was selected in 1892 as one of the twelve repro- sentatives appointed for seven years to the Legislative Council by the Ballance Govern- ment. It is a singular fact that the late Hon. Mr. Kerr is the first of those twelve members who has passed away. He and his family have been held in the highest possible respect and esteem in the district in which they have lived for so many years, and I think I am echoing the sentiments of honourable members when I say that during the nine years he was a mem- ber of the Legislative Council he has not made an enemy, nor has he left behind him a single member of either branch of the Legislature who entertains an unkind feeling towards his memory. His aim was to do his best in his day and generation for his fellow-men, and this House knows full well that he succeeded in doing much good ; and it will be some consola- tion for his family to know that his many excellent qualities are appreciated by his fellow- members of the Legislative Council and by the members of this House, and that the quiet, dignified personality that he possessed will long be missed in the Chamber with which he was associated. I move, That this House do now adjourn until half-past two o'clock to- 
<page:662>
morrow-Wednesday-as a mark of respect to | by that officer to the Hon. the Speaker. It is the late Hon. James Kerr, M.L.C. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce). - I have only a few words to say in seconding the motion. Time every now and again leaves its mark on this Legislature as it leaves its mark everywhere. We have not known the Hon. Mr. Kerr in this Lower House so well as we have known some other members of the Upper Chamber ; but at least those who have seen him about the pre- mises must have been impressed with his quiet demeanour and with his venerable appearance, and I think the Legislature has lost a man of mark in losing the Hon. James Kerr. I am quite certain members of this House desire to express to all his friends their deep sympathy with them in their loss. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) .- Sir, I first knew the Hon. Mr. Kerr when I was a youth in Melbourne, in the year 1857. He and my father were two of a co-partnery who owned the Melbourne Age before the advent of the Syme family as proprietors. Ebenezer Syme was their editor. In those years, as in later years, Mr. Kerr was always known to be an upright, honest, sterling man, who commanded the respect of every person with whom he was associated. I speak of that long connection with the fullest knowledge of what, in essence, the character of the man was. He was respected and esteemed by a very large circle of friends in the printing trade in Melbourne, and he carried with him that respect and esteem throughout his career in the printing trade of the Colony of New Zealand. The honourable gentleman, the Minister for Railways, has paid a very worthy tribute to the memory of Mr. Kerr. It is a tribute well deserved, and one that Mrs. Kerr and her family, whom I know so well, will be glad to hear has been spoken in this Parliament to the honour of one who rose from what is customarily called "the ranks," and became a legislator in this the land of his adoption. In this case it may be said most truly that we can speak nothing but good of the dead. Motion agreed to. The House adjourned at ten minutes to eleven o'clock a.m. # HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. Wednesday, 28th August, 1901. First Reading-4-per-cent. Debenture Loan-Breach of Privilege-Financial Statement. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER took the chair at half- past two o'clock. PRAYERS. FIRST READING. Stud Bill. 4-PER-CENT. DEBENTURE LOAN. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER. - I have to lay on the table a communication from the Controller and Auditor-General. It has been transmitted Sir J. G. Ward usual, I believe, to have these communications read. The communication was read by the CLERK, as follows :- " Audit Office, 27th August, 1901. "THE Controller and Auditor-General has the honour respectfully to submit to the House of Representatives, in accordance with the pro- visions of section 9 of ' The Public Revenues Acts Amendment Act, 1900,' a copy of the correspondence in a case under that section of a difference of opinion between the Audit Office and the Treasury on the question whether the 4-per cent. debentures for $500,000, raised in the colony under ' The Aid to Public Works and Land Settlement Act, 1900,' have not been sold at a price which will yield to the pur- chasers on their purchase-money a higher rate of interest by the year than the maximum statutory rate of 4 per cent. per annum. " A copy is submitted also of correspondence relative to an Audit Office objection to the form of the debentures, in declaring their security by an expression not textually in accord with the "J. K. WARBURTON, Act. "Controller and Auditor-General. "The Hon. the Speaker of the House of Representatives." Sir J. G. WARD. - Sir, I think that the House might reasonably allow this document to stand over until the Colonial Treasurer is in his place. It is a matter affecting the ad- ministration of his department, and it would be a very unfair thing to do anything precipi- tately in his absence, or to render it impossible for him to make any statement he may desire  to make, or to take from him the opportunity of moving any motion he may consider ex- pedient, seeing he has a full knowledge of the \- whole of the facts. Under the circumstances, I will ask the House to allow the document to stand over, and to suspend any motion re- garding it until the Colonial Treasurer returns. Mr. J. ALLEN -- I presume the paper will lie on the table in the meantime ? Sir J. G. WARD .- Sir, to put the matter in order, I will move, That consideration of the paper be postponed for a week. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) .- Sir, I trust the result of the motion will be that the matter will be placed on the Order Paper. We do not want the paper to be lost. If the effect of the motion moved by the Minister for Railways is that it will appear on the Order Paper, I dare say some consideration can be given to it ; but I do not think that will be the effect, and I am afraid we shall never hear of the report again. I think the best course will be for the Minister to move formally, That the paper lie on the table, and be printed, and that some Goveru- ment supporter should then move the adjourn- ment of the debate. The question would then find its place on the Order Paper, and would come up in due course. I ask your ruling. Sir. as to whether the effect of the motion at pre- sent before us is to place the matter on the Order Paper. 
<page:663>
Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- Any motion that is adjourned for consideration would appear on the Order Paper. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) .- I hope, Sir, the Minister for Railways will see his way to move that the paper lie on the table, and be printed. If he desires to move that it be referred to the Public Accounts Committee, that might be a matter for after consideration. I would suggest to the Minister that he should move that the paper do lie on the table, and, if he sees fit, be printed. Sir J. G. WARD .- The only object I have in view is to allow time for the Right Hon. the Colonial Treasurer to be present, and, under the circumstances, I think I will move that the document be referred to the Public Accounts Committee. Mr. PIRANI .- Lay it on the table first. Sir J. G. WARD. - The Public Accounts Committee can then bring up their report after the Colonial Treasurer returns. I think that is the fair course. I move, That the communica- tion do lie on the table, and be referred to the Public Accounts Committee for consideration. An .Hon. MEMBER .- And be printed. Sir J. G. WARD. - No; I will not move that at present. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Justice) .- I would like to say it appears to me that the statement of the honourable member for the Bay of Plenty with reference to the remarks of Sir Joseph Ward, Minister for Railways, is a most ungenerous one. The matter being one that more particularly affects the Colonial Treasurer's department, all that is asked is that it be allowed to stand over until that Minister is able to be present. I do not think there is anything to justify the suggestion that the paper might never be heard of again. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston) .- It is a most unusual course for a communication like this to be referred to a Committee without being printed. There has never been an instance in the history of the Parliament of New Zealand where a communication from the Auditor- General to the House has been treated in such a cavalier manner. If this proposal is carried, members will not be able to peruse the papers until the Public Accounts Committee have reported. I do not think the Hon. the Minister of Justice was fair in his reference to the statement of the honourable member for the Bay of Plenty. That honourable gentleman made no imputation on the Post- master-General at all. The imputation was that it was possible, not that the Post- master-General would prevent it coming up again, but that the Premier might do so, he being the one most concerned. It may be per- fectly right from his own point of view that this paper should be buried in oblivion, and we have no guarantee that that is not his inten- tion. That being so, we can assume that that is the course he would follow. If the Minister .does not intend that these papers should be printed, I think that the last communication from the Auditor-General to the Treasury, at any rate, should be made known to the members of the House, and so I intend to read it. It summarises correspondence extending over twenty pages, is dated the 26th August, and reads as follows :- Sir J. G. WARD .- I rise, Sir, to a point of order. I would like your ruling as to whether a portion of a public document from the Con- troller and Auditor-General can be read to the House by the honourable member before it has been laid on the table of the House. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- It is quite usual for members to read or quote from documents proposed to be laid on the table. Mr. PIRANI .- I will read it right through if the honourable member does not mind, but I want to spare the feelings of the House. There is an opinion from the Solicitor-General as to whether "Consolidated Fund" means "public revenues ": "The Governor having determined that under section 9 -- Mr. DUNCAN (Minister of Lands). - I do not think it is right that this document should be read at this stage. It contains an ex parte statement by the Controller and Auditor- General. This, I consider, is taking a some- what mean advantage. In my experience such a thing has never been done in the House before, and, if I am in order, I shall move, That the correspondence be not read. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- I must adhere to my ruling that when any document is com- municated to the House in this way, and moved to be laid upon the table, it is open to any member to quote any part of the document, or the whole of it. Mr. PIRANI .- I do not wish a partial state- ment to go to the House, and if the Minister will move that the papers be printed- Sir J. G. WARD .- Very well ; to avoid doing what seems to me to be unfair, I will move that the correspondence be printed. In a case such as this it is only right that the responsible head of the department should be present. And it appears to me to be a very extraordinary thing that on the first day of the Premier's absence this matter should have been brought forward. It would have been only fair to the Colonial Treasurer that, in a matter of such importance, he should have had some notice of the inten- tion to lay an important document such as this upon the table; and, in order to prevent any- thing in the shape of what might be regarded as an ex parte statement, I think it would have been better if the document had been held over until the Colonial Treasurer, who is due here to-morrow, was in his place. I shall therefore move, That the paper do lie upon the table, and be printed, and referred to the Public Accounts Committee. Mr. PIRANI .- I do not think the Minister is quite fair in his reflection about this correspond- ence being so promptly forwarded to the House by the Auditor-General. He must remember that the law says that, in the case of a dispute between the Auditor-General and the Colonial Treasurer, when the Governor intervenes the correspondence must forthwith be laid on the table. Now, the Government do not follow the law, where they are directed to lay returns on 
<page:664>
the table forthwith, or at certain times, and it is refreshing that there is one official in the Civil Service who does respect the law so far as that is concerned. This correspondence apparently extends over some time. The last letter is dated the 26th August, and if it had been held any longer from Parliament it would have been a highly improper thing. I am glad the honourable gentleman has decided to allow this to be printed, because we ought all to know what is in the correspondence. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin). - It might be better to divide the motion into two parts, taking the first part down to the word "printed." Sending the paper to the Public Accounts Committee will have the effect of preventing any member from referring to it in the course of the financial debate. I do not think the suggestion that this matter should be postponed until the arrival of the Treasurer from the South is unreasonable, but it seems to me that we should simply postpone consideration of the matter until to-morrow, and then take a discussion upon the arrival of the Treasurer from the South. Mr. MONK (Waitemata) .- I am not posted up in every phase of this matter, but it seems to me that this is a document belonging to the House, and with which the Premier is already familiar in his position as Treasurer of the colony. I do not see what can be gained by referring this to the Public Accounts Committee. I am seeking information, rather than objecting to it ; but, if there is anything in what the Hon. the Acting- Leader has said, it seems to lose it, for the Premier must already be informed of these documents, and have made up his mind on the matter, and must have been aware that this   document was coming before the House. Mr. HUTCHESON (Wellington City) .- I just want to say a word or two in reference to the somewhat ungenerous explanation given by the Postmaster-General as to the motive actuating the Controller and Auditor-General in submit- ting this document to the House now. Honour- able members will recollect that when the Premier was speaking in connection with the Public Revenues Bill, some few days ago, he used something like these words, "Honourable members will perhaps get a fresh instance within another forty-eight hours showing the necessity for the passing of this Bill." That shows, I think, that the Premier was aware that this document was about to be presented to the House. An Hon. MEMBER .- What do you find fault with now ? Mr. HUTCHESON .- I am finding fault with the attempt to deprive the House of what be- longs to it by statute. The report is presented to Parliament, and not to the Government. The terms are apparently synonymous in the mind of the honourable member, and I admit that the time is fast approaching when they will be synonymous, but they are not so yet. I submit that each member of the House has the right to a printed copy of that document, and that he has also the right to use whatever information is in that document ; and I simply say that the Mr. Pirani reference of this matter to the Public Accounts Committee will close the mouths of members of the House so long as it is before the Public Ac- counts Committee-that during that time the House will be dumb on this subject. I do not think that is fair. I agree with those honour- able members who state that the matter ought not to be brought on for discussion in the Colonial Treasurer's absence. I have as keen a sense of fairness and decency as any honour- able member, and I agree that, as he is inti- mately concerned with this matter, we ought not to discuss it in his absence. At the same time I submit that every member of the House ought to have a printed copy of this document in his possession at as early a time as possible. Mr. BOLLARD (Eden) .- I beg to move, as an amendment, That the paper be laid on the table and be printed. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) .- I will tell the House why I think they should adhere to the motion which I first proposed, and why I think they should negative the amendment of the honourable member. I pointed out carlier that, as a matter of courtesy -to say nothing of its fairness-the Colonial Treasurer, who is in charge of this depart- ment, ought to be present when this report is being dealt with, and I therefore moved that consideration of the paper be postponed for a week. Honourable members upon that side of the House immediately took exception to it, and they asked that the report should lie on the table, and be printed. I then agreed to do so. Very well ; now they move an amendment. The course I first suggested, to have considera- tion of the report deferred until the Colonial Treasurer is here, was, I think, the better course ; but as soon as honourable members get my resolution before the House, that this docu- ment be laid upon the table, and be printed, and referred to. the Public Accounts Committee. then they ask that the consideration cf 3.0. the matter be postponed until to- morrow, and if by any chance the Colonial Treasurer is not here to-morrow they will go on with its consideration in his absence. I submit that the right thing to do is to allow the docu- ment to be printed, to go to the Public Accounts Committee, and then, when the Public Accounts Committee has reported on the matter, the Colonial Treasurer, from his seat in the House. will have the opportunity of criticizing and discussing the whole question. I think that is, under the circumstances, the best course to take. I may say that I made no reflection whatever on the Controller and Auditor-General in stating that it was unfair, in the absence of the Colonial Treasurer, to present the papers to the House. I am still of the opinion I ex- pressed, and I most certainly think the Colonial Treasurer should be here when such a matter is being dealt with. I do not agree with the view of the honourable member for Palmerston that this report should be held over until to-morrow. as no benefit would be achieved. It is admitted that it cannot be discussed now in the absence of the Colonial Treasurer, and it would therefore surely be better to have it introduced into the 
<page:665>
House when the Colonial Treasurer is present, and then we could have a full discussion on the document in the ordinary way. I suggested at first that the consideration of the report should be postponed until the Colonial Treasurer's return, but the honourable gentlemen opposite opposed that course ; and when I moved a resolution on the lines indicated by those honourable gentlemen, they then wanted some- thing else. They evidently do not know their own minds. I hope the House will get the matter out of the road, so as to allow us to pro- ceed with the next business. I think I would not be doing my duty, in the absence of the Colonial Treasurer, were I not to refer to one remark which was made by the member for Wellington City (Mr. Hutcheson). That honour- able gentleman assumed, from the remarks uttered by the Colonial Treasurer a few days ago-and here I might say, Mr. Speaker, the honourable gentleman was referring to a former debate-that the Colonial Treasurer referred particularly to this document. When the Colonial Treasurer is here he can answer for himself. I do not know that he was referring to this document at all. I do not believe, myself, that he was referring to it ; but, as I say, I do not know what was in his mind. I believe he was referring to another matter, and to say that because of the introduction of this letter and this correspondence the Colonial Treasurer was paving the way on a former occasion for what is contained therein is not a fair state-  ment to make in his absence. Mr. HUTCHESON .- It fits in all right. Sir J. G. WARD .- I do not know that it does. I have not read the documents. Honourable members may have had the opportunity of reading them, but I have not. The fair thing to do is to refer this matter to the Public Ac- counts Committee, allow the Committee to re- port on it, and then afterwards take the debate when the Colonial Treasurer is present. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) .- I wish to point out to the Minister for Railways that he makes the very same mistake the Premier makes, through an excess of courtesy, in endeavouring to please the honourable gentle- men opposite. That is where the Premier always fails. If the honourable gentleman had stuck to the course he originally proposed he would have done what I consider to be the proper thing. There is no question that it is the intention of the House to refer this report from the Auditor-General to the Public Accounts Committee. That is the course which ought to have been adopted. My colleague, Mr. Hutche- son, said the Premier a few days ago stated that within forty-eight hours the House would be called upon to consider another such report as the House was then dealing with, and the honourable gentleman said he knew this was the very report the Premier was re- ferring to, and that therefore he ought to have been here to deal with it. Well, suppose the Premier did know that this report was coming up from the Auditor-Gene- ral, he could not have known then of the death of the Hon. Mr. Kerr. The honourable gentleman's absence is thus easily accounted for. But I do not think the Premier, when he spoke the other day, was referring to this matter at all ; and it does appear strange that the report of the Auditor-General was not presented to the House before to-day. And it appears still more strange that certain members of the House are so familiar with the contents of this report. Every time a report from the Auditor-General comes to this House certain members of the House seem to know all about it ; while the members on the Government benches know absolutely nothing of what is contained in the report. I undertake to say, from something that has passed under my observation to-day, that the gentlemen in the newspaper gallery are cognisant of the contents of the report already. The medium of com- munication between the Auditor-General and this House used to be the member for Patea, Mr. George Hutchison ; but although he is not here the information still comes round in the same way, for, when a report reaches Mr. Speaker from the Auditor-General, immediately certain members are ready to take action on that report. I would be sorry to balk those honourable gentlemen, or to step in and inter- fere with them in any way. If the honourable gentlemen wish to spring a surprise on tho Ministry I have no objection, the House has no objection, and the Public Accounts Committee can have no objection. Let the honourable member for Palmerston amuse himself in his ordinary way, but I hope the Acting-Premier will not fall into the error of the Right Hon. the Premier, and fail through too much excess of courtesy. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) .- I would just like to say a word or two in reply to one or two statements that have been made. There is no desire on the part of any member on this side of the House to take advantage of the absence of the Hon. the Treasurer. We feel that he ought to be here in connection with this matter, and I point out again that the effect of carrying this motion will be to prevent any member who wishes to refer to this matter in the course of the financial debate from doing so. I think the proper thing to do in this connection is to carry the amendment proposed by the honourable mem- ber for Eden, Mr. Bollard, to omit all words after the word "printed." It will then read, "That this paper lie on the table, and be printed," and when the Treasurer comes back to Wellington it will be competent for him to give notice of motion to bring it before the House in the ordinary way. I think that is what ought to be done. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston) .- The honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) told us a few days ago he was going to mend his ways, and insist on the Government taking the proper measures to carry on the business of this House according to the Standing Orders. He was going to keep a stiff backbone, and was going to insist on the Government carrying out the Standing Orders, and, if the Opposition had not the backbone, he was going to show them 
<page:666>
how to do it. Here is the very first instance that has come before the House since, and the ordinary course to be followed would be that this communication from the Auditor-General should be printed, so that members of the House would know what it is. Then, the honourable gentleman complains that there are members on this side of the House who seem to be conversant with the correspondence ; but I ask any honourable member to take up that correspondence and look at the last three pages, and there they will get the whole of the dispute nicely summarised. There is no need for any honourable member to take any time over the matter, as it is all set out there in the concluding pages as clear as daylight. It is all very well for the honourable member to talk about our being sharp to follow up what comes from the Auditor-General, but do we not know that in previous sessions questions of this sort have been referred to the Public Accounts Committee without being printed, and they have been buried in that Committee until the end of the session ; and not only was the House prevented from discussing the matter, but members were not even able to read the papers, because the only copies were before the Public Accounts Committee ? It is that necessity that has sharpened the wits of those who think it is right that not only the representatives of the people here, but the country generally, should know what are the disputes that are taking place between the Auditor-General, who is the re- presentative of this House, and the Trea- surer, as the executive officer of the colony. The object for which I spoke has been attained. The Minister has consented to have the corre- spondence printed, although it would have been better if he had not added the tag as to the    Public Accounts Committee - a Committee which, from the very fact that the honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) is the Chairman, is utterly useless in matters of this kind ; because, if a matter that ought to be dis- cussed by members is considered, he takes very good care that there shall be very little oppor- tunity for such discussion, and in this way does not even attempt to mend his ways. I do say that it is the right of the House to have these matters properly brought before them ; and if less objection were shown to considering questions of this sort, such doubts would not arise in the minds of members as now often do about disputes which arise between the two departments. The House divided on the question, "That the words proposed to be omitted be retained." AYES, 37. Allen, E. G. Fraser, A. L. D.

BREACH OF PRIVILEGE. Mr. PALMER (Ohinemuri) .- Sir, as Chair- man of the Goldfields and Mines Committee, I wish to bring under the notice of the House a breach of privilege. I have been directed by the Goldfields Committee to report that the Committee have come to the following resolu- tion :- "Resolved, That the Chairman of the Com- mittee be directed to call the attention of the House to the publication, on Friday, the 23rd August, 1901, in the Dunedin Star, of evidence given before this Committee, this Committee not having yet reported on such evidence." I have the paper -the Dunedin Star - with me, which I will lay on the table of the House. I move, That this report lie on the table of the House. The evidence is in connec- tion with a petition we are hearing - Mr. Easton's petition ; and Mr. Cook, against whom there are charges levelled in the petition, has complained to the Committee that the evi- dence has been printed, and I am directed by the Committee to report this to the House. As you will know, Mr. Speaker, it is in contra- vention of No. 229 of our Standing Orders to publish any evidence given before a Com- mittee before that Committee has reported to the House. I move, That the petition lie on the table. I may say, in regard to the evidence, I have looked at it, and that it is a full, true, and correct report of the evidence. And not only has the reporter of the Dunedin Star given a very true account of the evidence, but it appears to me that he has been fair to both sides, because the evidence for both sides is published in that report. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- Perhaps it will satisfy honourable members if a portion of this extract is read. Under our rules it is absolutely necessary that what is printed in the paper, or some portion of it, must be read. The Clerk will read a dozen lines or so. The CLERK then read the extract, as fol- lows :- " The following evidence has been given during the past week before the Mines Com- mittee in connection with the petition of Mr. H. E. Easton for the setting-up of a Royal Commission to inquire into the flotation and 
<page:667>
past management of certain mining companies named by him :- " Herbert Ernest Easton, examined on oath, said :- I am the petitioner. In view of the grave nature of the charges I am about to make in support of my petition, I ask permission to read my statement, in order to avoid errors and facilitate business. Before giving you my rea- sons for the action I have taken, I wish to explain how I come to be mixed up in what appears one of the greatest scandals in mining history of modern times. Last year I landed in New Zealand from the Old Country, com- missioned by some influential and wealthy friends to look into the dredging industry, pre- pared to invest for them a large sum of money, not, I may tell you, for mere speculative pur- poses, but for investment. To satisfy myself that the claims were genuine, I inspected a large number of the properties quoted on the Stock Exchange lists, and to facilitate my business dealt with a Mr. W. R. Cook, a man who I thought could be relied on, seeing that he had been engaged as a liquidator to several very large estates; and the fact of such appointment having been made by the Supreme Court of New Zealand appeared to me, though a new-comer, sufficient guar- antee to warrant my having thorough con- fidence in him and in his advice. An inci- dent occurred, however, which created a sus- picion in my mind that all was not as it should be. I at once went from Wellington, where I was living, to Dunedin, and asked to look over  the share registers, which showed a deplorable state of affairs, and I found myself face to face with what appeared to be serious irregularities, which tended, if unchecked, to bring ruin to a very large number of investors in this colony, and which seem to me to be in open defiance of the spirit of the laws of the country which Parliament has placed on the statute-book, this being done by clauses being altered or struck out when framing the articles of association, the effect being, I am told, to render the Act absolutely valueless as a safeguard. If this is so, it is a most serious state of affairs, and one which I fear, if action is not taken, will seriously retard investments in the colony, and ruin what should be (if carried out on honest lines in the spirit of the Companies Act of 1882) one of the most profitable and popular indus- tries of New Zealand. The industry itself is, in my opinion, a good one ; the Acts alluded to provide safeguards for investors, but these Acts are worthless if men who trade and make a living on the credulity of the public are to be allowed to draw up contracts and articles of association in direct contravention of the spirit of these Acts. Happily, though to some extent implicated myself, I was in time to prevent any of my friends' money being swallowed up in the maelstrom. I then set about to try to right matters, and that my action in exposing these irregularities is meeting with approval is evident by the number of letters I have received and am receiving from all classes in all parts of the colony. But I found my task much harder than I anticipated, owing to my inability to fully ventilate the subject in the Press on account of the newspaper pro- prietors being in fear of libel actions. Hitherto the subject does not appear to have been pro- minently under the notice of members of Par- liament, and as I did not feel inclined to submit to what I thought was a great wrongdoing, I determined to take action alone, and now come before you voicing the views of holders of thou- sands of shares, many of whom are struggling men and women. Of the latter I can, if re- quired, give you as an illustration a most sad case. I respectfully ask you to take the matter up, and afford such redress as is possible to those now suffering from the state of affairs existing. The irregularities complained of are as follow : (1.) I rind in many companies, espe- cially in those floated by Messrs. Cook and Gray, the articles of association are so drawn as to override what may be classed as the safety clauses of the Act under which they are framed, thereby allowing a few holders of shares to ob- tain almost absolute control of the companies. (2.) Large blocks or parcels of shares have been allotted to office clerks, who are evidently unable to meet the liabilities, as they have, up to the present, paid next to nothing on them. In one company floated by Cook and Gray one- seventh of the contributing capital was allotted to an office clerk in the employ of Mr. W. R. Cook, the promoter, vendor, broker, and director of the company. Another clerk was secretary, and the registered office of the com- pany alluded to was in Mr. Cook's office. And yet Mr. Cook has obtained brokerage on the said shares, taken from money paid in by genuine or qualified shareholders. (3.) Officers of com- panies are being registered in the same offices as promoters, these promoters acting as promoters, vendors, and directors, and their employés as secretaries. (4.) Brokers are re- ceiving brokerage on shares upon which no money has been paid. (5.) Shares registered in some cases improperly kept. (6.) Improper auditing. (7.) Directors have struck calls and invoked the law against defaulting shareholders at a time when they (the directors) are owing very large sums on their own shares. (8.) Directors passing transfers at a time when money is owing to the company by the seller. (9.) Vendors making a profit, on liquidation, upon shares which have cost them nothing. (10.) Directors receiving fees whilst almost entirely neglecting the business of the company. (11.) The formation of secret rings for specula- tive purposes only by promoters and directors at a time when the public were being asked to subscribe money to be used for mining purposes. (12.) That out of twelve companies, with an aggregate capital of £100,000, floated by Messrs. Cook and Gray, eleven must, in my opinion, go into liquidation. But for the action taken by the holders of vendors' shares many of these companies would have been wound up long ago. It may interest you to know, if you are not already aware of the fact, that the total capital of the Otago and West Coast gold-dredging com- panies is, roughly speaking, two millions and a half sterling. Gentlemen, what I have stated 
<page:668>
will give you some of my reasons for placing my petition before Parliament. During the past six months, through the kindness of many newspaper proprietors, I have published in the Press of this colony letters, all over my own name and address, calling attention to the deplorable state of affairs in connection with the management of the dredging industry, and making the charges just alluded to, none of which, I may tell you, have up to the present been repudiated. In order that the suspicion and reflection which exist at the present time on the commercial morality of the colony, to the detriment of what should be a sound and profitable industry, should be removed, on be- half of a very large number of investors, who are suffering without much hope of relief unless from Parliament, I would urge you, in the in- terests of the mining industry, in the interest of the progress of this colony, to pass imme- diate legislation to prevent this blot on the commercial morality existing any longer, and to appoint a Royal Commission to investigate the grave charges which have been made in the Press for some time past. That is my state- ment. "Can you give us any particulars of the com- panies mentioned in the petition? - Yes. have prospectuses of some of them with me; the others I can produce later on. I would like to make some remarks on these prospectuses. " We will be pleased to hear you now .- I would like to refer to the No Town No. 2 Com- pany. I find that it was floated by Messrs. Cook and Gray, that Mr. W. R. Cook acted as vendor and as broker, the registered office of the  company being at Cook and Gray's office, 17, High Street, Dunedin. The secretary of the company, Mr. W. Holsted, was an employé of Mr. Cook's, and Mr. Cook was until recently a director of the company. Mr. Cook had profits as vendor, salary as secretary, commission as broker, and fees as director. The prospectus of this company contains a long report signed by Mr. J. Howard Jackson, C.E. On Mr. J. Howard Jackson's name appearing on this prospectus there was a great rush for shares, . and they were quoted at several shillings He has also repudiated premium. having signed such report in the public Press of the colony. Now, directly the public read Mr. Jackson's repudiation, and knew of the deception that had been practised on them, the shares fell to a considerable discount, and have since been unsaleable. At the time when Mr. Cook and his employés were owing money on their shares-hundreds of pounds sterling- small shareholders were being sued for their arrears. "Can you tell us anything about the Lees Ferry Company ?- The Lees Ferry Company was registered on the 9th April, 1900, under the Companies Act of 1882. The capital- £8,000-was made up of 2,000 vendors' shares, allotted as follows : C. T. A. Broad, 120; Mr. J. Gill, 200; Mr. O. Kaye, 120; Mr. J. Taylor, 520; Mr. W. R. Cook, 1,040. The contributing shares, allotted as per share register, were 5,375 ; unallotted, 625: making a total of 8,000 shares. I understand that Mr. Cook was the purchaser of this claim, and also vendor to the company. It was stated on the prospectus that there was a deed of sale from Joseph Taylor to Mr. Cook, based upon the contracts filed at the Registrar's office. The deed of sale from Mr. Cook to the company is dated the 9th March. 1900, while the articles of association are dated the 1st March, 1900. The dates on these deeds have been altered, but the alterations have not been initialled. I find that some of the persons who signed those articles of association did not pay for the shares they took on signing those articles of association, nor do their names appear on the share register of the company. In connection with this company I find that the register has been improperly kept ; in some cases the addresses of shareholders have not  been entered, and pencil notes have been made directing that in the case of a Mr. and Mrs. Farley all notices of calls due from them were to be sent direct to Mr. Cook. Mr. Cook was a promoter of this company, he was a broker, he was a director, his nomi- nee - Mr. W. Holsted - was the secretary, and the registered office of the company was in Mr. Cook's own office. The share register on the 31st July, 1901, states that no money I had been paid on 250 shares, that allotment- money was owing on 1,600 shares, and that Mr. Cook's late partner, William Gray, owed allotments on 500 shares. Now, on all these shares Mr. Cook has received 23 per cent. brokerage out of moneys paid in by the genuine and qualified shareholders. I find also that Mr. Cook received twenty guineas for attending as director only one meeting during the first year of the company's existence. The prospec- tus states that this company cannot fail to get large returns of gold, and recommends the pro- perty as a good and safe investment for capital. This claim was tested at the expense of the qualified contributing shareholders by his (Mr. Cook's) own employe, Mr. Chester, as & mining expert, and was condemned by him as abso- After the report of Mr. lutely valueless. Chester, Mr. Cook allowed another of his nomi- nees, Mr. Howes, on the 26th March, 1901. to use his (Mr. Cook's) proxy and vote against the liquidation of the company. After the investi- gations made in March, 1901, by the special committee deputed by the Dunedin Stock Ex- change, of which report you have heard, this company was immediately removed from the lists and quotations of the Exchange. Upon Mr. Cook's resignation from the Board I was selected in his place on the 11th March, 1901. His employe, Holsted, then . issued a notice for the first annual meeting, in which two out of the three directors were made to re- tire instead of one. On the 26th March. 1901, when the annual meeting came on. his other employé, Howes, nominated himself as director, and, by using his employer's (Cook's) proxies, secured the seat on the Board and removed me. I went with my solicitor to inspect the deed of sale, which the prospectus stated could be inspected the office of the interim secretary. Mr. Ho 
<page:669>
the company, and gave a written order to the company's solicitor to produce the document. This the solicitor declined to do. I find that in June last Mr. Cook's late partner, William Gray, and other large shareholders gave evi- dence on oath, in defending payment in respect of shares, to the effect that Mr. Cook assured them that the liability of the shareholders in this company was only 1s. per share, and that Mr. Cook had stated that this and other com- panies were entirely under his own control- that he had arranged for the other directors to be his nominees. A Mr. R. H. Abbott stated, in sworn evidence, that Mr. Cook promised him, if a market existed for the shares he would sell sufficient of the shares that Mr. Abbott applied for to make the balance fully paid up. At the last meeting of this company Mr. Cook's nomi- nee and employe, Howes, stated that if a resolution to liquidate was carried, the liquida- tion might be very expensive to the share- holders, as his employer, Mr. Cook, might claim to receive a dividend from the contributing shareholders on his vendor's shares. " Questioned as to the Auckland Beach Back Lead Gold - dredging Company (Limited), the witness said : It was registered in August, 1900, the promoters being Messrs. Cook and Gray, the interim secretary Mr. W. R. Cook, the vendor to the company Mr. W. R. Cook, and the capital £9,000-2,500 fully paid-up shares being allotted to vendor as part payment, also £500 in cash to the vendor, and the cost  of flotation and registration. The prospectus After states, 'Will yield excellent returns.' 2s. per share had been paid by the contri- buting shareholders the claim was condemned by Mr. Cook's own employe and expert, Mr. Chester, as valueless. This company was liquidated some months ago, but up to the present time no statement of accounts has been rendered. " As to the Tucker Flat Company, the witness said : Up to the 28th February last £479 4s. 9d. of the shareholders' money had been spent, and no attempt made to either design a dredge or build the pontoons. On the 15th July an extract from the share register states that £12 10s. was due on application-money, £90 on allotment- money, and #836 owing on the first and second calls. Included in these sums was £50 owing by Mr. Cook's wife, and £90 by Mr. W. R. Cook. That was on the 15th July of this year, and at that date no dredge had been ordered or contracts made. I find that the share register has been improperly kept, the shareholders' addresses not given, and pencil notes directing, in some cases, all notices of calls to be sent to Mr. Cook. I find, also, that certain shareholders have stated in sworn evidence that Mr. Cook promised that only 1s. per share should be called up, and that his co-directors should be his nominees. During the time that I was a director I declined to pass a transfer of 250 shares which Mr. Cook had, by a bill, taken over from a Mr. L. S. Benjamin. On my removal from this Board this transfer was put through by Mr. Howes, Mr. Cook's em- and who is now, as I have stated, chairman of the company. He passed the transfer with £25 owing. On the 15th July, 1901, Mr. Cook's bill to Mr. Benjamin was dishonoured. For what purpose, other than the promoter's benefit, is this company existing ? " The witness next referred at length to the Ross Day Dawn Gold-dredging Company, the circumstances in connection with which, he said, were much on the same lines. Ho alleged that, at the time when very large sums were owing to the company by Mr. Cook and his employés, Maceand Howes, other smaller share- holders were being summoned and threatened with distress warrants. " With regard to the Ngahere Company, the witness alleged that Mr. Cook's employé and clerk, Edward Mace, held no less than one thousand contributing shares, and up to the time that he (Easton) left Dunedin only £50 in respect of these shares, out of #100 due, had been paid ; and yet on the balance of those shares Messrs. Cook and Gray received 2} per cent. brokerage from the genuine or qualified shareholders. " As to the Wicklow Company, registered on the 3rd March, 1900, the witness stated that on the 27th July of this year application- money was owing on 250 shares, allotment- money on 1,250 shares, and on all these shares Cook and Gray had received 2} per cent. brokerage from the moneys paid in by the qualified shareholders. Mr. Cook, who was elected a director on the 9th April, 1900, received twenty guineas for attending one directors' meeting only during the year. "Mr. Easton added : ' I may mention, gentle- men, that I joined the Boards of these four companies for the express purpose of breaking up these rings of monopolists ; and I had no other object, as I have stated over my name and address through the papers of the colony, than to smash the companies up and break up these rings of monopolists.' "Mr. W. R. Cook's evidence was to the effect that grave charges had been made, and he wished an opportunity to look into them, in order to see how far they were true, though he knew a very great deal of what had been said was absolutely untrue. He would like to get all the documentary evidence for the Com- mittee's information. He had not been in Dunedin for more than three weeks during the past eighteen months. With a view of refuting or supporting Mr. Easton's evidence, he asked the Committee to order the production of the companies' books and to summon the secretaries and directors. The witness then proceeded to make a statement, reserving the right to ex- amine Mr. Easton subsequently. He declared (so it is understood) that he was never at any meeting when the shares in the Cook and Gray companies were allotted, and, personally, had nothing to do with the allotment. Possibly he might have been at one meeting when the allot- ment occurred. As to the statement that, of the twelve companies floated by Cook and Gray eleven would go into liquidation, he was pre- 
<page:670>
pared to say that five of them were paying. The articles of association were prepared by Mr. Allan Holmes, solicitor. In every one of the twelve companies he (Mr. Cook) held at least five hundred contributing shares, and Mrs. Cook had a like number. All calls had been paid on them. The statement that his wife owed £50 on the shares in the Tucker Flat Company was a surprise to him. If there was such a liability it was one call of 2s. per share. He paid up 20s. in the pound on the Ross Day Dawn shares on the 2nd May. He held 900 contributing shares, and had paid £900 on them. On the 19th April, the date of his alleged liability, he had been away from Dun- edin for some months. Mrs. Cook and himself had to date paid £600 on contributing shares in the No Town No. 2 Company. Both Mr. Jack- son and Mr. John Don had reported favourably as to the No Town claim. The adjoining mile of creek had been visited by Mr. Cutten, whose report appeared in the prospectus. In regard to all the other companies Mr. Don was sent to prospect and report, half of them he con- demned, the prospectus disclosing a favourable report as to others. His report was printed without comment, and companies were floated thereon. He (Mr. Cook) had never sold a vendors' share, though several went up to a premium, and now stood to lose more than any one connected with the companies in question. He ridiculed the statement as to the directors being his own nominees; the articles of association were signed by seven shareholders, who nominated and elected the directors during his absence from Dun- edin. After being elected a director on most of the companies, he was asked to look after their interests on the West Coast. He did not     know that his fees had been paid : they were paid into the office and receipts given by the clerks. His services, for which the directors had made him an allowance, were inspecting matters on the Coast. Mr. Gray's evidence about misrepresentation was probably the out- come of pique-a forced dissolution. When this evidence was given in Court the Magistrate declined to hear the witness, holding that there was no misrepresentation. The Dunedin Stock Exchange meeting was a one-sided affair. The Auckland Beach Back Lead Company went into liquidation before shares were allotted, owing to Chester's report. Mrs. Cook and himself each held five hundred shares in that com- pany, but they never had a vendors' share. To that company he paid $50 in calls, and Mrs. Cook paid $50. There were not more than five hundred shares sold outside of Hokitika-the Hokitika people. Mrs. Cook, and witness bought the lot. Witness proceeded : What Mr. Easton had said about himself coming out here to look into dredging was absolutely untrue. On this point the witness said that he came out here on family affairs. I may say that he is, unfortunately, a connection of mine by marriage. He came to me and thrust himself upon me, saying that he wanted to go into the dredging industry, and asking me to advise him. This I refused to do, but after some pressure he went to the Coast, saw the claims there, and wanted me to sell him an interest in the companies-the Tucker Flat Company and others. I declined to do so, but told him that I knew a man who was carrying more shares than he wanted, and I would try to get these from him at par. Mr. Easton said, "If I can get in, and the Grey River turns up trumps, the others will jump." The Grey River Claim did not turn up trumps, as we anticipated, and Mr. Easton was left with his shares, the same as other people. No money has been spent in building dredges for any of the companies, and if they are wound up we shall lose our 2s. a share, or something like that. Any misrepresentation on my part, or any mal- practices in any respect whatever, I deny; there may have been mistakes made, the same as in everything else, but to all of these charges I am sure that I can give a good reply. The witness denied that the auditors were ever employed at his office. The existing companies, whose legal office was at his place, were working satis- factorily, the shares were generally at premiums. and dividends were being paid. He urged that documentary evidence should be ordered to be produced, and that Messrs. Howes and Holsted and Mr. Allan Holmes be called. Were that done, he ventured to say that the whole aspect of these very grave charges which had been made against him would be altered. "In answer to members of the Committee. Mr. Cook explained that he paid Mr. Howard Jackson $50 for his report on the No Town claim. Mr. Don also reported, both being favourable reports. There was no misrepresen- tation concerning the adjoining mile (which was to have been floated), as the prospectus would show. No one had voted without pay- ing the application-money. During his alence the office was managed by Mr. Holsted, the se- cretary to the Cook and Grav group. If a mis- representation had been made by another man. he objected to being saddled with the respon-i- bility, though he was liable for any pecuniary loss. A slump had been struck, a lot of people had been disappointed, and to get out of their liabilities they were making misstatements and distorting the facts. Cook and Gray had float. 1 some fifteen or sixteen companies in all. Dred:" had been built for five of the companies, and were now working. Four more were being built. The Dobson No. 2 was an unfortunate claim, the dredge having been built with a short ladder. The various companies resolved that they would not build a dredge until they saw how the Grey River dredge worked, thus getting the benefit of their experience. The dredge did not start working till September or October. Then Mr. Easton started his agita- tion, and the whole thing had been hung up since. If the companies went into liquida- tion, or were not successful, he stood to lose double as much as any other man in the place. He had not dealt with any of his shares, either contributing or vendors'. "Asked for an explanation of the serious allegations regarding brokerage charges, the witness said, ' We got 2} per cent. brokerage on 
<page:671>
the contributing shares; that is what every- body got, with the exception of those who got an over-riding commission of 1} per cent. and 2} per cent., which most of the brokers did in Dunedin. If any brokerage was paid on shares that had not been paid for the auditor should have called attention to it.' The only matter bearing on the point known to him-speaking from memory-was in the case of the Ngahere Company. He got a letter from the liquidator, addressed to Cook and Gray, asking for a refund of $5, being the application-money on a hun- dred shares not paid by a shareholder who had nothing at all to do with Cook and Gray. No brokerage was allowed on vendors' shares, only on the contributing shares. " Further questioned, Mr. Cook said that he had taken the option of some of the claims from the people on the West Coast for the vendor, and acted as broker and a director. The shareholders appointed the directors, and the latter made No. 17, High Street, Dunedin, the office of the company. He did not know that there was anything wrong in a firm float- ing a company and acting as he had done. Those of his employés who held shares in the companies mentioned did so as a private specu- lation, and not on his behalf, to influence votes in his favour. The statement that any man ever held a share in trust for him was abso- lutely incorrect. Mr. Mace would get assistance and be able to pay his calls. " Asked whether, in saying he stood to lose  double as much as any one else, he had taken into consideration the moneys he received for the sale of claims to the companies, Mr. Cook replied that he never got a shilling in that way -none at all. Where there had been cash paid it had been paid to the original owners. He never had a shilling from any company that he floated. If any of the companies went into liquidation he could not claim a penny as ven- dor. He could not understand how the auditor missed charging the brokerage back. " After the witness had concluded his evi- dence Mr. Easton asked leave to repudiate Mr. Cook's statement that he was either a connec- tion or a relative of his. He stated that he landed in the colony on the 17th January, 1900, and until the 23rd April following had never heard of that gentleman. What induced him to believe that Mr. Cook was a man to be trusted was the fact that he had been appointed by the Supreme Court as liquidator of several large estates." Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- I understand it is the desire of honourable members not to take up time by reading the whole of these three columns, so I will take the voice of the House as to whether the whole extract should appear in Hansard. Hon. MEMBERS .-- " Aye " ' Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- It is the duty of some honourable member now to move that a breach of privilege has been committed. Sir J. G. WARD (Colonial Secretary) .- Sir, I will move, That a breach of privilege has been committed by the publication in the Dunedin Evening Star, of the 23rd August, of certain evidence given and documents produced before the Goldfields and Mines Committee of the present session, and which Committee has not yet reported to the House on the matters re- ferred to. I think it only right to say that under the Standing Orders of the House it is a very serious breach of privilege, not only of the House itself; but it is a very unfair thing to people coming before a Petitions Committee that evidence should be disseminated-whether it leaks out trom the Committee, or is given out by the Committee-before the Committee has had an opportunity of reporting to the House and supplying the full evidence. In addition to this, it is not fair to the newspaper Press of the colony that, by any unusual ability of the re- presentative or representatives of any particular journal, preference in this way should be given to any particular journal, however enterprising, in any part of the colony. I have seen a good deal of trouble arise from matters of the sort during the time I have been a member of this House, and I think it is very much to be regretted that breaches of privilege of this kind from time to time occur. How the evidence gets out it is impossible to say, but it appears an extra- ordinary state of things that we do find that Press representatives are apparently able to get hold of documents and information before they ought to; and, whenever any inquiry is at- tempted to be made, as to how they come by the documents or information, it is most diffi- cult indeed to ascertain how they are able to say they get them in a fair and honourable way, and I believe the representative of the Dunedin Evening Star to be one of the fairest and most upright journalists in the colony, and one who would not act dishonourably. I do not think that if a Press representative is smart enough to get hold of documents or information of the kind, that any great exception can be taken to his utilising them for the benefit of the paper he represents. Where the weakness is, it appears to me, is in the way the business of Committees is conducted, with the result that evidence of this kind is allowed to leak out. But, once it has leaked out, it only remains for the House to declare that a breach of privilege has been committed, and to go further, if the House so desires- although in the past it has always been shown to have been an unsatisfactory state of affairs- to bring the publishers and the reporters of the journals who commit breaches of privilege of the kind to the bar of the House. Probably the best course to take is to do as was done on the occasion I refer to, and to pass the resolution I have moved, and to specially direct the attention of members of the Committees to the fact that breaches of this kind are a serious reflection on the House itself and also on the Committees. Sir, I beg to move the resolution. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) .- Sir, I think the course usually adopted in these cases should be followed. I think the Chairman of the Com- mittee has not yet fully explained the means by which the information was published in this newspaper. An Hon. MEMBER .- He does not know. 
<page:672>
know ? Sir, I understood that this is what took place : The evidence was taken by a shorthand writer appointed by the Goldfields and Mines Committee. He is a Parliamentary Committee reporter. The evidence was handed round, I understand, among the members of the Com- mittee-about twelve in number. I understand also that, as usual, the evidence was handed to the witnesses, three in number, and it is the evidence of these witnesses that has been pub- lished in the Dunedin Star. I understand also that a most unusual course was adopted in the case of one witness. He was allowed to have the whole of the evidence of all the witnesses ; and I think I am justified in saying that to this particular witness we may very well trace the leakage. I do not believe in bringing people before the bar of the House, as no good ever comes of it, but I think that if the Chairman of the Com- mittee, or the members of the Committee as a whole, have any well-formed belief as to the name of the culprit who furnished the infor- mation to the newspaper reference of some kind ought to be made to him. It is very clear that all persons connected with the Committee ought not to be blamed for the guilty act of one person. It seems to me it was an unwise proceeding on the part of the members of the Committee to allow one witness to have in his possession the whole of the evidence. He was entitled to have only his own evidence; and it appears to me it was through that want of care in intrusting this one witness with the whole that the breach of privilege has arisen. How- ever, nothing is likely to come of it. A breach of privilege has been committed, and, if the House affirms it, I suppose the usual caution will be given to the members of the Committee not to do it again. Of course, it will not be done again, till the next time. Mr. TANNER (Avon) .- Sir, I would like to say half a dozen words with regard to the un- satisfactory nature of these cases, and of the decisions arrived at. We are about to be in- volved in the declaration that a breach 3.30. of privilege has been committed. have been a member of this House for ten years, during which time at least a dozen cases of this kind have occurred, and no doubt a good many others have transpired which have not been brought before the House. Let me call attention to the position in which members of these Committees are placed. An inquiry takes place; evidence is taken down in short- hand, which is subsequently printed, and which, by our Standing Orders, ought not to be divulged to the world till the report of the Committee has been placed on the table of this House. Notwithstanding this, evidence does leak out repeatedly. Sometimes members wish to know what is being done before a particular Committee, and they can often obtain informa- tion more accurately in the columns of the newspapers than from any source that may be available to them as members of this House, assuming that they are not members of the Committee in question. Evidence can only get into the possession of about three the Committee before whom it is given; second, the witnesses, who do not necessarily know the whole of the evidence, for, un- less some special circumstance takes place by which any particular witness can get possession of the evidence-and this is very unusual -I think witnesses can be excluded from the cate- gory of those through whom the information leaks to the public ; and third, the evidence is in the custody of certain officials, and finally it goes to the printers at the Printing Office. I do not attempt to blame any persons whatever, but a member of a Committee stands in daily danger of losing his reputation as a truth-telling man, and as a man of integrity. As for the motion before the House, to the effect that & breach of privilege has been committed, that is just as much brutum fulmen as anything heard before. What consequences does such a declaration carry. Before the week is over the newspapers of the colony will be laughing at the House for declaring that a breach of privilege has been committed. If the declaration carries absolutely no consequences- An Hon. MEMBER .- You do not know that. Mr. TANNER .- I have never seen any con- sequences as a result of such a breach, and I have known a good many cases. I would therefore ask, if, under the circumstances, it is worth while to have any Standing Orders st all. It seems to me nonsensical that we should have piled up a mass of rules and regulations which are supposed to be observed, but very few of which are observed as they stand. They are deliberately set aside in this House, and outside the House the conduct of members is imitated. The whole thing in this way be- comes a perfect farce. Of course, I cannot use words to reflect on the House itself ; but I have no doubt that, during the next few days, many of the newspapers will do their best to belittle the resolution if carried. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) .- Sir, I think we were bound to raise this question, for the reason that if evidence of this kind is pub- lished it may be altogether one-sided. In this I case it is to a certain extent one-sided, although the whole of the evidence taken on a particular day was published. This was, however, altered by subsequent evidence. It is therefore not fair to give evidence that is ex parte, and the question of privilege ought for this reason to be raised. The honourable member who has just preceded me says that no consequences will follow. I understand the course usually followed in such cases, if the House carries a motion affirming that a breach of privilege has been committed, then, according to previous rulings of Speakers, the publisher of the paper shall be called to the bar of the House, in order that he may give whatever explanation he can. Then comes the point, as to what action the House will take. I cannot say, of course, what action the House may take. He may be able to give such explanation that we may consider it unwise to take any further action. If, on the other hand, his explanation is unsatis- factory, then, I take it, the acting leader of 
<page:673>
the House will move some motion ; but until we hear what his explanation is I do not think the honourable gentleman is right in saying we should take no action. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston) .- The honourable member for Avon may not be right exactly in words, but there is no doubt he is right in effect, because there are no more ridiculous motions in this House than what are called " breaches of privilege." As a matter of fact, the trouble in connection with the publication of these matters arises from the carelessness of the Committees themselves. I do not refer to one Committee especially ; but if a Committee allows its witnesses and the members of the Committee as well to take copies of the evi- dence, and use them practically as they please outside the Committee, it is only natural that an enterprising newspaper man, who sees good matter for his paper, will take advantage of the simplicity of those witnesses, or those members of the Committee, and make use of the informa- tion if it is worth having. The member for Avon was not exactly right perhaps about the punishment which follows the crime -- Mr. TANNER .- I never saw any. Mr. PIRANI .- I am going to give an in- stance of the punishment which fitted the crime. It may be remembered that one gentle- man of the Press was cast in a breach of privi- lege. He was called to the bar of the House, and, as a punishment, the electors sent him to represent them in Parliament. That was a punishment, undoubtedly, because that gentle- man was quite satisfied with one term of Par- liament, and was glad to have his freedom again, because he never again asked the electors to send him back. Now, motions such as these only tend to make more of the newspaper man, to advertise his newspaper, and his own ability and foresight in getting the information. Mr. MORRISON. - Does not the reporter always get a rise in wages ? Mr. PIRANI. - I suppose the honourable gentleman knows, as he comes from the city where this matter was published. In this case, no doubt, the genial reporter will get a rise in wages, because he deserves it if he can get hold of three columns of evidence taken before a Select Committee. I know when I attempt to get a few lines of any Committee's proceedings, not for publication- Mr. FISHER .- We order you out. Mr. PIRANI .- You say you will send for a policeman. But I think, in matters of this kind, the House makes too much fuss ; I think the House should recognise, after what has been done, that the Committee themselves ought to take action to find out how evidence of the sort has leaked out, and take the proper steps to prevent any leakage in the future. Beyond that, I think we should be simply wasting the time of the House and the country by discus- sing a paltry matter like this as a breach of privilege. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton) .- I agree very largely with what has fallen from the honourable member for Avon in connection with this matter. The Standing Orders of VOL. OXVII .- 42. this House, in the clearest manner possible, require that the evidence taken by any Select Committee of the House, and the documents presented to such Committee, should be re- garded as confidential, and ought not to be published by any member of that Committee or any other person. Are we going to say that this rule is to be carried out? If we are to have our Standing Orders ignored by the Press of the colony, then we might find somebody or other breaking them in some other and more important direction, and bring about a scandal. I think the Press of this colony ought to be given to understand that this House in- sists upon its Standing Orders being obeyed. I see no object whatever in simply having our guns charged with blank cartridge. If these Standing Orders are for the guidance of honour- able members, then the Press should be made to understand that such publication will be re- garded as a breach of privilege, and will be fol- lowed with penalties. For my part, as I have stated, I think the member for Avon has put the position clearly and succinctly when he says that the question is : whether we are going to have Standing Orders at all. If the Standing Orders are not to be obeyed by those outside the House, how can we insist on their support within Parliament itself ? Mr. HORNSBY (Wairarapa) .- I am rather surprised at the sentiments which have just been expressed by the member for Riccarton in regard to his brother journalists and their enter- prise ; but as a journalist I am going to give the honourable member a tip. It is a remark- able fact that the members of this House, or the members of the Committees of this House, are not the only people who seem to give away State secrets. I can remember many instances in the Dunedin Evening Star where exclusive information has apparently been given to that most remarkable of all reporters in the colony, the special reporter of the Dunedin Erening Star. Weeks before appointments have been made by the Government, and before they have been announced in the ordinary way, the fact of such appointments has been stated in that paper. An Hon. MEMBER .- That was not a breach of privilege. Mr. HORNSBY .- No, it is smartness on the part of the journalist. I think, as a journalist, I ought to congratulate him from my place in the House upon his sterling ability as a press- man, and I do so. But here we are to-day discussing a question of breach of privilege com- mitted by a newspaper man, when, as a matter of fact, the breach of privilege has apparently been committed by a member of the Committee ; not necessarily, of course, and possibly honour- able members may narrow it down and say it might have been done by some one of the witnesses who had the evidence in his possession. There is where the mistake comes in, and if the reporting on those Committees was conducted as an ordinary newspaper would see to it that its reporting was conducted, then in the most important cases there would be no danger of anything of this kind occurring. Where comes 
<page:674>
in the necessity of witnesses being allowed to | Standing Orders, do away with them utterly, correct their evidence given before a Committee if the reporter of that Committee is a com- petent man? There is no necessity whatever for witnesses to go over their evidence and correct it if the reporter is competent, and there is no necessity for allowing that work to go out of the hands- An Hon. MEMBER .- What about Hansard corrections ? Mr. HORNSBY .- So far as I am concerned, I never want to see my Hansard proofs ; but I do know this: that many members of this House copiously interlineate, and some of them rewrite their speeches : and in one instance recently an interpolation was made by a member of this House which reflected very gravely upon another member, and which was never reported by the Hansard reporter, but appears in Hansard. That was a breach of the privileges of this House, and a very serious matter, and it was brought before Mr. Speaker, but nothing has been heard of it since. Sir. J. G. WARD .- What did it refer to ? Mr. HORNSBY .- It referred to the inter- polation of particular words by a member of this House into his speech, although the matter was brought under the notice of the Speaker. But, coming back to the question of this breach of privilege, I am of the opinion expressed by other members who have spoken before me on the matter. Suppose that we bring to the bar of this House the publisher of the paper- for that is about all we can do - we cannot  touch the reporter. It is the gentleman whose name appears on the imprint of the Star who will have to be brought before the bar of the House, and possibly he may know nothing about it. Well, if this gentleman is brought to the bar of the House, it is possible for this House to fine the gentleman for what has ap- peared in his paper. Possibly, as one honour- able member said, we might put him in the cellar of Bellamy's ; but that is not the point I want to come to. The point is : that, so far as I am concerned, I do not want to go any further in regard to giving a gratuitous and very valuable advertisement to the estimable people who own the Dunedin Star. My opin- ion is that it would be far better, and would be consulting the dignity of this House, if we simply record the fact that a breach of privi- lege has taken place, and if we give the officers of this House to understand in the future that there must not be so much laxity in the con- duct of the business of the Committees which are set up by this House. Mr. W. FRASER (Wakatipu) .- I am afraid the last speaker has not been consulting the dig- nitv of the House, or, indeed, his own, judging by his remarks. He has spoken as a journalist in this House, and not as a member. He has forgotten that, while he is in this House, what- ever profession he may follow privately he is here representing a section of the people of New Zealand. I am sorry to hear the light tone in which honourable members have spoken in regard to this question. Well, I say that we ought to do one of two things : either burn the Mr. Hornsby or else strictly enforce them. That is what we ought to do ; but, Sir, to treat the matter as a huge joke is not consulting the dignity of the House. I am very, very sorry indeed, to see the tone which this debate has taken. The member for Wairarapa assumed that the whole fault lay with the members of the Committee. The honourable gentleman, surely has not read the Standing Orders. The breach of privilege lies in publishing the information quite as much as in giving it to the paper. Probably all that will result from this motion will be a certain amount of no- toriety for the paper, and an intimation to the members of the Press gallery not to do it again : but I say that the matter ought not to stop there. This House ought to put its foot down and say, "These are our Standing Orders, and we shall insist on their being respected in the future." It is simply bringing ourselves into contempt to bring up motions of this kind un- less we are prepared to take some further steps. For my part, I shall be quite prepared to go any length, and show people that they cannot break those Standing Orders with impunity. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin). - There is no doubt. Sir, that in this instance a breach of privilege has been committed, and I agree with previous speakers that the whole matter of the reporting of the proceedings of the Select Committees is in a most unsatisfactory position. Time after time we have seen the reports of the procced- ings of Select Committees reported in the Press of the colony in a way which was contrary to the Standing Orders, and yet no notice what- ever has been taken by this House. Sir, I do not blame the pressmen in the very least. It is their business to obtain information in every possible way, and we all know that the repre- sentative of the Dunedin Evening Star is one of the most enterprising occupants of the Press gallery ; but I do blame the parties, whoever they were, who divulged the information. And, in this connection, I would like to call your attention, Sir, to a ruling of the Speakers, as reported on page 155, No. 2. It is as follows : - " Members disclosing proceedings of a Select Committee before it has reported have been committed to the custody of the Sergeant-at- Arms, and the publishers summoned to the bar." Now, Sir, we want to find out who were the parties, members or otherwise, who divulged this information. If this House decides that a breach of privilege has been committed, what is to happen then ? Are we going any further ? An Hon. MEMBER .- No. Mr. MASSEY .- Some one says "No." I think we ought to go further. But it is not possible for this House, as a whole. to the roughly inquire into the matter. I was going to suggest to the leader of the House that be should set up a Committee of Inquiry for this purpose. And there is a precedent for what i suggest. I would refer the leader of the House to the Journals of the House of Representatives, year 1874, page 74, on the question of privi- lege :- 
<page:675>
with power to confer with any similar Commit- tee that may be appointed by the Legislative Council, to inquire into and report on the mat- ter of the publication in the Daily Tribune newspaper of certain evidence taken before the Joint Committee of both Houses on the Ward- Chapman inquiry, and which evidence has not yet been reported to the House: three to be a quorum, with power to call for persons and papers. Committee to consist of Mr. Speaker, the Hon. Mr. O'Rorke, Mr. Rolleston, Sir Cra- croft Wilson, C.B., and Mr. Andrew." That was a case almost exactly parallel with this one. The Commission was set up, in- quired into the matter and reported, and the delinquents were called to the bar of the House and punished in the usual way. An Hon. MEMBER. - What is the usual way ? Mr. MASSEY .- They were called upon for an explanation and an apology, and I venture to say that the publicity was sufficient punish- ment. But if we are not going to thoroughly inquire into this matter, if it is not going to be sifted to the bottom, we ought to stop where we are. I would, however, sooner see the Press admitted to Select Committees, than that the present state of things should continue. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Mines) .- We have heard a good deal about this question from different points of view, and there seems to be in the minds of most of those who  have spoken a feeling to commend the news- paper that has had the enterprise to obtain this information, and, so far as I am concerned, I am quite prepared to do the same thing myself. But I say we have the right to go to the root of the matter and find out where the fault lies. I do not think the fault was with the reporter or even with the members of the Committee. The fault is with ourselves. Select Commit- tees are appointed, and the result is that these Committees are virtually public rooms; and members who have no connection with the matter themselves-they may have an interest in it, but they have no connection with it .-- may attend regularly, and even when the Com- mittee is deliberating, unless a stand is taken up, as I understand has been taken up by my friend the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee - that is, to decide that those not connected with the Committee, and who are not witnesses, are not to be present. Until such a rule is adopted by all Com- mittees you will have evidence taken before the Committees leaking out. If only those who are connected with the Committees, and the witnesses under examination, are present, then if any evidence leaks out the Committee will be responsible for the source whence the information has come. As things at present are, no one can say where the information comes from. We know that information ap- pears in the papers, and that it is a breach of privilege ; but you cannot blame any one in particular, and the reason is that the Standing Orders are not complete enough in regard to those who attend the Committees of the House. the Committee's shorthand writer. They are not impressions gathered from various members of the Committee. I think the State ought to pay the shorthand writer's fee. Mr. McGOWAN .- Quite so, so far as I am concerned. I am a member of the Committee, and I believe there has not been due care taken in regard to the evidence given before it, in regard to secrecy. Though technically a breach of privilege has been committed, I do not see how we can do anything ; till we amend our own course with regard to the position of Com- mittees we have little reason to complain of any enterprising newspaper obtaining news al- most at first hand. These typewritten copies of evidence should be under the hand and seal of some one responsible, and not left lying about loosely, so that any one who chooses to come into the room can get hold of the informa- tion contained in them for newspaper purposes. Mr. WILLIS (Wanganui) .- There seems to me to be something very singular in the way such a mass of evidence as this has leaked out. It has been suggested that what took place was divulged by members; but two columns of evi- dence would be a very difficult thing to divulge, and it is quite evident a shorthand report must have been made use of. Surely some one must be aware of the manner in which the report was obtained from the person who was taking the evidence. Mr. FISHER .- It was the Goldfields and Mines Committee's report. Mr. WILLIS .- If it was the Committee's report from which it was obtained, that makes it so much worse. I regard it as a very serious matter indeed that a report of this kind should be allowed to leak out ; and if this sort of thing is to go on there will be no security whatever of evidence being kept secret till it is laid on the table of the House. The matter ought not to be treated lightly. There is a feeling that there is no use our proceeding further in the matter, and I must say, from my own experi- ence, the results are very small indeed when breaches of privilege have taken place. But we ought not to go on like this always. I think, myself, we have a very poor chance of punish- ing the paper, nor do I believe that from a newspaper point of view it has done anything wrong. The one who ought to be punished is the one who furnished the report; and the matter ought to be inquired into. It is not the editor or printer, who was only doing his business in obtaining the report, who ought to be dealt with so much as he who furnished the report. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) .- I am a member of the Goldfields Committee, but I can assure the House that I am not the one who divulged this information. The informa- tion was evidently taken from a typewritten copy of the evidence, taken on the first day on which evidence in Easton's petition was considered ; and, if honourable members do nothing in the matter, I suppose the whole of the evidence taken by the Committee will 
<page:676>
it is not faced, and nothing is done now, it would be better to have the Press present on Com- mittees. And then, of course, if the 4.0. Evening Star would only keep a copy of the type set up, it would save the Govern- ment Printing Office so-much money for print- ing the evidence of this Committee. It seems to me that this question has to be looked at ; and that if we do nothing, the rest of the evidence will be published in the same way. The Hon. the Minister of Justice may laugh, but it is a serious thing; and if things go on as they are going on now, then the House will not have the first information, as it ought to have, with regard to evidence, but the public, through the Press, will know more than members of this House. That seems to be the point, and in declaring the publication a breach of privilege this House should take steps in order that this may not occur again. I trust honourable members will proceed further in the matter. We ought, I think, to find out who the culprit was who disposed of this typewritten copy. Now, Sir, the Acting. Premier, in moving the motion, quoted a case, and that case was the case of yourself, when there was a breach of privilege owing to some of the evidence given before the Public Accounts Committee having been divulged, and you, Sir, from your place in the House, got up and openly said that you had divulged it, and you apolo- gized. I think, Sir, the members of the Gold- fields Committee ought to do the same, and take your manly stand, and wo, at all events,  would be exonerated from any insinuation that we had divulged any evidence. I admit, Sir, that the affairs of the Committee are per- haps not conducted strictly in accordance with secrecy, because I think almost any one could have got hold of the evidence. It was knock- ing about the table of the Committee-room for the whole morning ; but I do not think any member of the Committee divulged that evi- dence. I do not know how it got out, but there is no doubt that from a similar source the correspondent of the Evening Star who got the former evidence will be able to get the other evidence, and if that is done we shall simply see the whole of the evidence printed in the Evening Star and in ocher papers, because if nothing is going to be done I do not see why any other paper should not get it. What is the use of having Standing Orders if nothing is going to be done. I shall consider myself to be at liberty to give what I like, and, if that is the wish of the House, the sooner members understand it the better. I think something ought to be done, and that this matter ought to be pursued further as a matter of principle although I do not think that much barm has been done. Mr. GRAHAM (Nelson City) .- It appears to me that until some radical change takes place the raising of questions of breaches of privilege are simply a waste of the time of the House. There is no good result arises from them. We have had many breaches of privilege discussed, Mr. Herries not have risen except for a remark made by the Hon. the Minister of Justice, who suggests that the blame rests with members of the House, and that until members of this House who are not members of Committees are prevented from attending meetings of a Committee of which they are not members this sort of thing will go on. Now, that is a reflection on the honesty and integrity of members of the House. The right of being present at the proceedings of any Committee is a privilege that ought not to be taken away from members. Every member should always have the right, as he has now- and, I hope, always will have-of attending any Committee he pleases to listen to the proceed- ings ; and the rules and standings of the House are as binding upon members of the House not members of any particular Committee as they are upon members of that Committee. Does the Minister really mean what he said- that it should be otherwise? I hope he does not. Why, Sir, it would be a Star Chamber proceeding. The reason we are here is for the purpose of understanding and doing the busi- ness of the country, and one means of ascer- taining it is for members of the House, if they choose, to attend the meetings of Committees to obtain information. The rule as to keeping sacred all that transpires at Committee meet- ings is as binding on all members of the House as on the members of each Committee. In this case we have two columns and a half. Mr. FISHER .- Three columns. Mr. GRAHAM .- The honourable member says there are three columns. Well, it would be impossible for that amount of evidence to be accurately reported by any one member of the House or any one member of the Committee. I understand that in this case the full and com- plete evidence that has leaked out has been printed for the information of the Committee. Mr. PALMER .- I did not say the evidence had been printed. I said it had been sent to the printers, and we had the evidence back - the original evidence, not the printed evidence. Mr. GRAHAM .- I do not wish to split straws. The evidence went to the Printing Office and came back ; it came back and passed through the hands of the Clerk ; it reached the hands of some one who gave it to the newspaper. and the newspaper reporter naturally took hold of it and gave it to the public. I know that when evidence is sent to the Printing Office it comes back in a printed form, and it is not always to members of Committees. Copies get about somehow to persons who are not members of the Committee. That is where the difficulty is. I hope the Minister of Justice did not really mean that, until members of the House were pre- vented from attending meetings of Committees of which they were not members these things would take place. Mr. McGOWAN (Minister of Justice) .- Sir, I wish to say that the member for Nelson City has too closely applied my remarks with refer- ence to those members who are not members of Committees. My remark was made generally 
<page:677>
and who were not members of those Committees ; and, as the honourable member himself ex- plained, it is a fact that when these copies are printed, outside members get them. Mr. MILLS (Minister of Customs) .- Sir, I was about to remark that I thought the member for Nelson City had misunderstood the application of the words of the Minister of Justice. I think be placed a wrong interpretation on them. I was sitting close to the Minister of Justice and I heard what he said, and what he remarked was that, until members were prevented from attending meetings of Committees, one could not say whether it was a member of the Com- mittee or any other member of the House who divulged any information that might leak out. He was not finding fault with members attend- ing the meetings of Committees. I believe the honourable gentleman is a supporter of pub- licity in all matters. However, with reference to the matter now before the House, I do not take the same view of it as some members, who seem to treat the matter in a sense of levity, instead of upholding the dignity of this Cham- ber. My impression is that a great many mem- bers hardly realise the immense power of this House when it wishes to deal with a serious breach of privilege. This may or may not be a serious case, but there is no doubt the power of Parliament to deal with breaches of privilege is very considerable, and should not be treated lightly, as the result may be very serious to those who least expect it. I do not think it wise on the part of members to let it go forth to the world that any one who commits a breach of privilege by disobeying our Standing Orders need fear no punishment, which is a great mis- take. We must uphold them or repeal them, or, if not, we shall stultify ourselves. I also con- sider that there should be no disclosure of the proceedings of any of these Committees until the Chairman himself brings down the report. Mr. GRAHAM .-- That is provided for by the Standing Orders. Mr. MILLS .- We know that, without the honourable member telling us ; but some people seem to forget their responsibility. My opinion is that there should be no disclosure from the Committee until the Chairman brings down the report. I have known instances myself in Committee where a result has been arrived at on a certain day, but before the time had arrived to bring down the report, the Committee, in its wisdom, had considered it advisable to make some alteration. This shows the importance of not disclosing their deliberations before the proper time. I only wish to emphasize that, in my opinion, this matter ought not to be treated lightly. I am not casting any blame on the editor or the reporter of this paper. I have no idea as to how they got the evidence, but what we consider breaches of privilege should be treated by this House in a serious manner. Mr. SYMES (Egmont) .- It seems to me to be a funny thing that we should have in con- nection with newspapers what is practically a close corporation. The instant you touch one of them, the result is like holding out the that by publishing evidence taken before any Sessional Committee before a report is made to this House by the Chairman of such Com- mittee he is committing a breach of privilege. The breach of privilege was the publishing of evidence taken before the Committee, and, to my mind, it was done in defiance of our Stand- ing Orders. As to Committees divulging, I do not think such a thing ever takes place. I should not like to hear of members being charged with this. The Committee shorthand writers, I must admit, might do a great deal better than they do. On more than one occasion we have found our evidence so much hashed about that we could hardly recognise the transcript. The House is probably to blame for supplying such bad reporters for the Committees, and I have often thought it would be a wise thing to let the Hansard reporters do the Committee reporting. An Hon. MEMBER .- They could not do it at present. Increase the staff and they could. Mr. SYMES .- We should have men we can rely on to do this work, and not rush in any one from outside to take evidence at five minutes' notice. If necessary, increase the Hansard staff, and then let them do the whole of the Committee reporting. I say again, Sir, that it was well known to every member in the Press gallery that by publishing this evidence a breach of our Standing Orders was being com- mitted. We may talk for a month on this question without any good results if we do not insist on the maintenance of our Standing Orders ; and unless we do this we are simply advertising the newspapers. If we let the matter drop where it is, we have been wasting time and providing a cheap advertisement for the newspapers. I say, with several other members who have spoken, either abolish our Standing Orders or carry them out to the bitter end. Mr. PALMER (Ohinemuri) .- As regards our Committee reporters, Sir, I do not wish any misapprehension to go abroad in regard to the young gentleman who reported this evi- dence. We have found him a most capable, conscientious, and hardworking young man. His reports have been admirable, and we have had to make very few corrections. We called the reporter in and asked him if he knew any- thing about this evidence being made public, and he said he did not. We never believed he had anything to do with it. Now, as to these reports getting out, I to a great extent put the blame on the shoulders of the Government. Sir, they put us in the freezing-chamber of this House. We are obliged to sit in that chamber from nine o'clock in the morning until one o'clock, and, although there are two fires there, we can barely keep ourselves from being frozen to death. Then, we are not allowed to have a Committee-room to ourselves. Other Commit- tees sit in that room, and the cupboard accom- modation is so small that it is impossible to lock up the bundles of correspondence and documents that come before us from time 
<page:678>
after the papers as well as he can; but, as they are lying there from Friday till Monday, it is impossible, unless we have cupboards to lock up our papers, to prevent them from being seen by persons outside the Committee. Now, as to the remark of the honourable member for Wel- lington City (Mr. Fisher) that one of the wit- nesses got the whole of the evidence, that witness was Mr. Cook. Mr. Cook had complained that charges were made against him in Mr. Easton's evidence but which did not appear in the petition, and he asked that he might be allowed to have the evidence so that he might be able to answer the charges in detail. Well, we thought it was only fair that he should be placed in a position to defend himself. and accordingly we allowed him to have a copy of the evidence in detail, which he got. I do not think Mr. Cook disclosed that evidence, when Mr. Cook was the gentleman who complained to the Com- mittee about it having appeared in the Dunedin Evening Star. An Hon. MEMBER .- Did anybody else get the evidence ? Mr. PALMER .- No: Mr. Cook was the only one outside the Committee who got the full evidence. Mr. HALL -JONES (Minister for Public Works) .- I am sorry to hear from the honour- able member such a gloomy account of the room occupied by the Mines Committee, but I may say that the room I had set apart for that Committee was a very nice room, and the Go- vernment are not responsible for the alteration. The honourable gentleman referred to the want of accommodation for placing the documents of the Committee, and I can only say that if, as Chairman of the Committee, he had only men- tioned that matter before I would have seen that it was attended to; and I will see that proper provision is now made. I think the honourable member for Nelson City made re- flections-or what might be taken to be reflec- tions-on the Clerks of the Committee and the Government Printing Office Clerk. Mr. GRAHAM. - I did not intend to do it. Mr. HALL-JONES .- The honourable mem- ber's words were open to that construction. He said that these papers passed through a num- ber of hands, including the Clerk of the Com- mittee, and then through the hands of several others at the Government Printing Office ; and he stated he had known other cases where the evidence had leaked out. I say that the Clerks of the Committees, in my opinion, are officers who know their duty, and who are very careful to see that nothing leaks out. Then, as to the Government Printing Office, I may mention that the honourable gentleman was Chairman of the Banking Committee-one of the most important Committees which, I suppose, ever sat in this Parliament -and he will admit that not a whisper of what transpired in connection with the proceedings of that Committee ap- peared in the public journals. An Hon. MEMBER. - The report was published in Dunedin before it was laid on the table of this House. Mr. Palmer hope the honourable gentleman has no inten- tion of casting any reflection upon the Clerks of Committees or upon the Government Printing Office. But there is another question now before the House. I understand that Mr. Easton petitioned both Houses of Parliament. and I believe that a Committee of each House is dealing with the same subject, so that the same evidence may have been given before a Committee of another place. I understand that this evidence was given before the Committee of this House on Thursday, and that it appeared in the Dunedin Evening Star on Friday. Thus it must have been transcribed here and sent away on Thursday evening or early on Friday morn- ing, so that some one must have acted very promptly in the matter. I am glad, however. to hear the honourable member's assurance that he had no intention to cast any reflection upon the Clerks of Committees or upon the Govern- ment Printing Office. Mr. GRAHAM (Nelson City). - I desire to make a personal explanation. The Minister for Public Works stated that I cast a reflection up- on the Clerks of Committees, or upon the Gio- vernment Printing Office. I did nothing of the kind. I did not intend to do so, and I certainly did not do what the Minister has unfairly sug- gested. I was replying to the Minister of Jus- tice, who said that these things would never be cured until members of this House were not al- lowed to attend the meetings of Committees of which they were not members ; and I pointed out that there were numbers of ways in which the evidence might get out, and that it often passed through numbers of other hands : but I did not cast any reflection upon Clerks of Com. mittees, nor upon the Government Printing Office, in any shape or form. Mr. HALL-JONES .- I think, if the honour- able member will peruse his Hansard proof, he will see that his words are open to that con- struction. Mr. ELL (Christchurch City) .- If the repre- sentatives of the papers had any respect at all for our Standing Orders before this discussion this afternoon, they will have none now, after what they have heard from a number of honour- able members in this Chamber, because one after another has got up and commended the papers for over-riding and disobeying the Stand- ing Order, which expressly states that informa- tion which is given before a special Committee shall not be divulged and shall not be pub- lished. The only exception was the member for Riccarton, who is also a newspaper man. and he protested against it. I think that. if our Standing Orders are not of any use at all- if they are not to have any effect ; if any breach of privilege is to be simply laughed at as a matter of very trifling occurrence : and if the breach is to be ridiculed and laughed at, as it was by the Minister of Justice this afternoon- then I say that the sooner we abolish the Standing Orders the better. It is not a bit of good keeping them amongst us if they are to be treated lightly in the way they have been by honourable members this afternoon, and also by 
<page:679>
House by the Chairman of the Mines Com- mittee is a delightfully simple one, if members could only bring themselves to accept it. He explained that the whole cause of the trouble- the root of all this business which has kept us going the greater part of this afternoon-is simply that the Committee-room in which this unhappy Committee has to deliberate is far too cold. According to Mark Twain, there is a moun- tain in his country which is so cold that no one in its neighbourhood can possibly speak the truth. It seems that, according to the Chairman of the Mines Committee, some similar explana- tion accounts for the moral delinquencies which have taken place in connection with the deliberations of the Mines Committee. I do hope that, whoever the Minister is who is in charge of the heating apparatus of these build- ings, he will see that they are given an extra fire there for the rest of the session, and it is possible then that we shall not have any more trouble. I accept the lucid explanation of the Chairman in the spirit in which it is offered ; but I do wish to enter my protest, along with the member for Christchurch City, against the tone of levity which has been adopted, not merely by representatives of journalism in this House, whom we might pardon for such weak- ness, but by others who are not directly in- terested in that profession. We have heard even from a Minister of the Crown that the reporter and the editor who published that  report were simply engaged in a legitimate journalistic enterprise to which even the Minis- terial bench was constrained to pay its tribute of praise. Now that, of course, is reducing the   dignity of Parliament and reducing our Stand- ing Orders simply to the condition of a farce. Another member also stated that the person who furnished the report was the guilty person and should be punished. Well, Standing Order No. 229 says,- "The evidence taken by any Select Com- mittee of the House, and documents presented to such Committee, and which have not been reported to this House, ought not to be pub- lished by any member of such Committee, nor by any other person." The fact of a member of the Committee, or a servant employed by the Committee, furnishing the report does not relieve the person who takes advantage of the report and publishes it from the responsibility for his action. There may be half a dozen culprits in the matter; but the fact that there are five others does not relieve any individual of the six from the re- sponsibility. To my opinion, it is contrary to the dignity of this House to take any such view. According to our Standing Order, the reporter of that newspaper has simply been guilty of listening at the keyhole of the Legislature. No member of this House would think of saying that listening at the keyhole of a private room, and reporting the result of what was heard in that way, was legitimate journalistic enter- listening at the keyhole of the Legislature to words and transactions which, according to the expressed wish of the Legislature, should be kept an inviolable secret. Supposing the Dunedin Evening Star, on the evening in question, had come out without an imprint, instead of coming out with these three columns of confidential matter overheard in one of the Committee-rooms of the Legislature; in that case the offence would, of course, be trifling either morally or legally, and certainly would be the result merely of accident or oversight ; yet the publisher would have been fined £5, and the law would not allow the Court to inflict a smaller fine. They might also be fined for every copy of the paper, but they could not pos- sibly be fined less than $5 on any information duly laid. The result would have been that somebody in that newspaper office would have been rapped over the knuckles, and a good many somebodies in that office would have taken considerable care in the future to see that no such oversight occurred again. Now, what is the position here ? This is an offence wilfully premeditated and deliberate. It has supplied the newspaper with three columns of good copy in advance of every other newspaper in the colony, and we are going to deal with it in such a way that if a similar opportunity arises next week, or even this week, that paper would take the same action as it has on the occasion under notice. Is it not contrary to the dignity and privileges of this House that we should assert our dignities and privileges in that fashion ? An Hon. MEMBER .- Yes. Mr. ATKINSON. - It may be quite in keeping with certain lines of our practice regarding privileges and dignities, but it is certainly not a course I would like to see followed by this House, or any representative body that values its privileges and dignities. If the Postmaster-General had been present while the honourable member for Franklin spoke, I feel sure there was a suggestion made by that honourable member he would have been glad to accept, and that is that if this resolution is to be anything more than farcical in its results, anything more than blank car- tridge-or, as the honourable member for Avon called it by its Latin name, brutum fulmen-if it is to be anything better than that, I know of no better way to arrive at it than by adopting the honourable member for Franklin's suggestion that we should have a Committee appointed, according to precedent, which should investi- gate the matter thoroughly, and fix the re- sponsibility on the proper party, and then take such course as may be deemed advisable after the Committee has reported, and make sure that those who have been responsible for this breach of privilege will think twice at any rate before committing a similar breach. I hope the Minister will take this into consideration, and enable us to pay some practical heed to our own dignity and the conservation of our 
<page:680>
continue as at present. I would either repeal the Standing Order, and allow the reporters of any paper to be present at Committees, or, if I intended to maintain the provisions of the Standing Order, which says that the proceed- ings are to be kept secret, I would take such precautionary steps that the secrecy should be inviolable ; and certainly no member can say the course proposed by the resolution, if not followed up by something more drastic, is of that nature. Major STEWARD (Waitaki) .- It appears to me that the House is in the position that it is absolutely necessary to determine upon one of two things : either we should rescind the Stand- ing Order, which has been in existence ever since there has been a Parliament in this colony, prohibiting the publication of evidence taken before a Select Committee until it has been laid before the House, or we should take means to enforce that Order. There can be no possible getting out of that position. Parlia- ment is often spoken of as being the highest Court of the realm. Now, if a newspaper offends against the rules of the Supreme Court it is punished for contempt, and if it offends against the rules of this House knowingly, then it is for the House, as the highest Court, to say what should be the result to the paper so offending. It is all very well for honourable members to get up and ridicule proceedings of this kind. Some honourable members seem to think all they have to do is to pat on the back any newspaper reporter who shows him- self smart enough to get round the Standing  Orders of the House. That is only one view of the case, and, in my opinion, a mistaken one ; the real position being that either the House must insist on having its Standing Orders re-     spected or must be content to be placed in a position of contempt. It has been urged that the House itself does not always rigidly observe its own Standing Orders. That, I am sorry to say, is only too true; but two blacks do not make a white, and because the House does not always adhere to its Standing Orders, it does not by any means follow that it ought to condone the breach of any of its regulations by any out- side party. As I have said, we have only two alternatives from which to choose : either to insist on our Standing Order being obeyed, or to repeal the Standing Order altogether. I do not think the House is prepared to adopt the latter alternative. I do not think any single member would say that the evidence taken before a Committee should be allowed to be published in a newspaper in detail before it has been laid before this House. It is not fair to the parties before the Committee that it should be so published, as such a publication is calculated to lead to a prejudging of the case, and to the placing of the matter before the public in an incomplete and unsatis- factory form. Therefore, Sir, I think that what should be done is this: that we should pass a resolution affirming that a breach of the Mr. Atkinson follow the course taken on a previous occasion by appointing a Committee to inquire into the matter, and bring down a report of the whole facts of the case, and then it will be for the House to say what should be done. And, Sir, though I do not prejudge the matter at all- I am simply stating a hypothetical case-if it is proved to the House that a breach of the privileges of the House has been committed by any particular person, or by any particular newspaper, then I think it will be for this House to pass a resolution and take such action as will show to that person or newspaper that this kind of procedure does not pay. It could. indeed, be made so expensive a course that no newspaper would proceed on those lines in the future. That is the direction in which we should go, or we should at once altogether abandon the Standing Order which has in this case been infringed. Mr. HUTCHESON (Wellington City) .- Sir. I agree entirely with those who say that we ought to do one of two things : either to amend our Standing Orders-that is, to repeal this par- ticular Order-or to act up to them. Does any one mean to say that this House cannot pre- vent or cannot discourage newspapers from pub- lishing premature reports or proceedings of Committees? It would not bring up the in- flu ntial Dunedin Star or the Evening Post to fine them £5. This afternoon's transaction is worth hundreds of pounds to this journal already, even if it is fined. The House would be more likely, if it wanted to carry out what is laid down in the Standing Orders, to fine that journal about £500 at the start, and then dis- courage it gradually by raising the fine 100 per cent. for each subsequent offence. What has been our experience in the past ? Since I have been in Parliament I have seen five or six similar farces of this sort, and they have always ended in smoke. Here is the logic, looking this House right square in the face : Are you going to perpetuate this farce, or are you going to say that those who make a breach of our laws by deliberately publishing for commercial gain certain information that the Standing Orders declare to be privileged, are to be punished for it, or are the offenders to be let off scot-free. with the further additional advertisement of the farce in Parliament, like this afternoon? Now, I submit we have now come to the time when this House has got this to do : First of all to declare this is a breach of privilege, and then carry a subsequent resolution in terms of that enunciated by the member for Franklin, that a Committee be set up to discover the facts. There can be only one finding as the result of that Committee's deliberations, because the offence is not for disclosing information -not for giving it informally-but for publishing it. If any member of the Committee publishes, or any other person publishes, such information, the offence is committed. Now, I quite agree with my colleague for the City, that it would be perfectly intelligible to open the doors of Com- 
<page:681>
to that. It might impede matters and prejudice matters, but it would naturally be much more logical and philosophical than to say a certain thing is a breach of the Standing Orders of this House, which ought to carry some penalty at the will of this House as a consequence, and not to carry it any further. Now, to be reason- able and sensible men we ought to declare this a breach of privilege. Consequently, we ought to say we will set up a Committee to discover how the information came to be published and who published it, and to mark the disapproval of the House we should inflict punishment sufficient to prevent a repetition of the offence. I have no sympathy with this vaunted journal- istic enterprise when it carries with it a wilful and predetermined breach of the Standing Orders of the House. This publication, I say, was done with a wilful knowledge, but carried with it a sense of security inasmuch as never before had any punishment been given, and that therefore no punishment would be given in this case. To put it in the classical language of the member for Avon, it was a brutum fulmen. I think, Sir, the House should up- hold the Standing Orders, or rescind them altogether. Motion agreed to. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) .- Sir, the motion having been carried, my col- leagues and other members consider it would not be fair to the House to allow matters to stand as they are; and, under the circum-  stances, the Government will take the course that was taken some years ago in order to elicit further information on the subject. I think honourable members will agree with me that, #cc-zero to a large extent, the precedents that are on record show clearly that to attempt to bring the publisher of the journal to the bar of the House would be unsatisfactory in the extreme, and that it would be better to set up a Privilege Committee in order to make inquiries as to how the information became public. If the Com- mittee can elicit that information it will pro- bably meet the case. I will move "That a Committee of Privilege be appointed to inquire into and report on the matter of the publication in the Dunedin Evening Star of the 23rd August, 1901, of certain evidence taken before the Gold- fields and Mines Committee, and which evi- dence has not yet been reported to the House ; three to form a quorum, with power to call for persons 'and papers : the Committee to consist of Mr. Speaker, Major Steward, Mr. Fisher, Mr. J. Allen, and the mover." Judging by what has come before me, the House is de- sirous that the mere affirmation by the House that a breach of privilege has been committed is not sufficient, and that it would be well to have the matter inquired into, in order that the Standing Orders of the House may be respected, and that cases of the kind may, if possible, be prevented in the future. Mr. BARCLAY (Dunedin City). - Sir, I desire to say a word or two before this motion House has affirmed that a breach of privilege has been committed by the publication of this report in the Dunedin Evening Star, and it is clear, I think, that a motion should follow to the effect that the proprietor or the publisher of that paper, if it be desired to give him a chance to reply to any charges, should appear at the bar of the House and make what defence he can. After that a motion should follow in- flicting punishment of some kind or another, if it is considered advisable to do do. Let me here remark, as a matter of some interest, that the practice of fining seems to have become obsolete in the British Parliament. A high authority says :- " In former times the House of Commons im- posed fines for breaches of privilege, but the practice has long been discontinued, except in so far as the payment of fees as a condition precedent to release from imprisonment par- takes of the nature of a fine." The House, however, still retains the power of imposing the punishment of imprisonment. A Committee such as the honourable Minister suggests is, no doubt, proper and advisable for the purpose of discovering where the leakage occurred ; but it does not touch the question of the principal offender, the proprietor or the publisher of the Evening Star. And I should like to know whether it is the intention of the Minister to move in the direction I have suggested, after this motion is disposed of, or not. Sir J. G. WARD .- Let the Committee report first. Mr. BARCLAY .- The Committee cannot re- port anything but that the publication is a breach of privilege; and the House has de- clared that it is so. A motion should follow that the publisher or the proprietor of the paper should appear at the bar of the House. I would like to know whether Ministers intend to move a motion to that effect or not. Sir J. G. WARD (Colonial Secretary) .- The course I have followed is what was formerly adopted by this House. Two courses are open -the one is to summon the publisher of the journal to appear at the bar of the House, and the other is to set up a Committee of Privilege to inquire into the matter. After that Com- mittee reports, it will be for the House to con- sider whether further action is necessary or not. Mr. BARCLAY .- I submit that, the House having declared this report to be a breach of privilege, it is the duty of the Government to act on that resolution, and ask the proprietor or the publisher to appear before the bar to give an explanation, and, when the Committee's re- port is submitted, it will be for the House to deal with the culprit who has given the infor- mation. It has been said this afternoon that this House has been a subject of ridicule owing to its weakness in punishing breaches of privi- leges and other offences against it. The news- papers of the colony may well ridicule the House if it does not defend its dignity and 
<page:682>
utter contempt and inefficiency if they do not defend their privileges. He said,- " Could it be expected that they would stand high in the estimation and reverence of the people if, whenever they were insulted, they were obliged to await the comparatively slow proceedings of the ordinary Courts of law for their redress? They certainly must have the power of self-vindication in their hands ; and if there be any authority in the recorded pre- cedents of Parliament, any force in the recogni- tion of the Legislature, and in the decision of the Courts of law, they have such a power." I do not say in this case that any very great harm has been done, nor do I for an instant blame the reporter who furnished the report. On the contrary, I think it was a very clever and smart thing for him to do. He had nothing to do with the publishing of it. The whole of the responsibility for the publishing of the evi- dence must rest upon the management, and it is simply the publication of the report that our Standing Orders deal with and endeavour to prevent. I do not think it necessary at this stage to say anything further, than that I be- lieve it is the duty of the Government to at once take steps to have the publisher brought before the bar of the House. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) .- The Minister for Railways has told the House that there were two courses, either of which might be followed. I am afraid he has been led astray. There is one question, and there is only one course pos- sible which can be followed. Where he has  been led astray is in this : The case of 1874, which was quoted, was a case in which a Com- mittee of Privilege was set up to inquire into a question of privilege, before the House had decided whether a breach of privilege had been committed. But what is the position to-day ? The House has declared this to be a breach of privilege, because it is as clear as daylight that, a newspaper-that is to say, some person out- side the Committee-having published evidence taken by the Committee before the Committee had reported to the House, a breach of privilege has been committed. Now, I ask, What is the next course that ought to be pursued ? The course is clear, both by the rulings of previous Speakers and by what has occurred before in this House. If honourable members like to turn to the "Rulings of the Speakers," on page 158 they will find, in the case of a newspaper article, "If a member calls atten- tion to it it is read by the Clerk." That was done. Then, " A motion should be made that it is a breach of the privileges of the House." That also was done, and it was carried. Now, what is the next course to pursue ? "The per- son responsible for the article is summoned to the bar of the House to give an explanation ; after the explanation the House determines what course should be pursued." There are two rulings by Mr. Speaker Munro, one in 1867 and the other in 1868, dealing with this parti- cular matter. I have them both here, but I Mr. Barclay and the Speaker's ruling was that the person responsible is to be called before the bar of the House for his explanation. And it would be a gross injustice to the man who was accused of a breach of privilege if he were not immediately called before the bar of the House for his ex- planation. He might have some explanation that would be satisfactory to the House. In that case the House would proceed no further. He might admit the breach of privilege and apologize, as was the case in 1874, and the House might be satisfied with the apology. If the House is not satisfied, it may determine on a fine, or some other means of punishment. It is as clear as it can be that a breach 5.0. of privilege has been committed ; and we have declared that a breach of privilege has been committed ; and now we ought to ask the person responsible to make an explanation, and to make an apology if he has an apology to make. We are going in the wrong direction in proposing to set up a Committee when we have already declared that a breach of privilege has been committed. I think that the honourable member who is temporarily in charge of the House has taken a wrong course -- a course which is not according to precedent, and a course which very likely will be unjust to the publisher of the newspaper. It may be that somebody else is to blame ; it may be that some- body else has disclosed the evidence. When we have the publisher before the bar of the House -as we ought to have-we can ask him for an explanation, and ask him who disclosed this evidence. An Hon. MEMBER .- He will not tell. Mr. J. ALLEN .- If he does not tell us he will have to suffer the consequences ; but it is obvious that it is right that we should ask how he came by this evidence, and if we find that there is another culprit in the course of the examination we have a right to punish him as well. We have one culprit now, and that is the publisher of this evidence, and that culprit ought to be punished. The House has declared this to be a breach of privilege, and the House  would be stultifying its own action if it does not go further, and ask the publisher of the newspaper to come before the bar of the House. and then, having heard his explanation, it will be for the House to decide what shall be done. 1 It is quite clear that the Minister is absolutely astray in this matter. The course now being pursued is not according to precedent, and is a wrong interpretation of what took place in 1874. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City). - Suppose the culprit does not defy the House. Support he appears at the Bar in obedience to the order 1 of the House and makes a full and ampie apology ; and suppose, also, that he did what a captain-I forget his name-did in England when he was adjudged guilty of a breach of privilege by the House of Commons. He ap- peared at the bar of the House and made LD ample apology. It was the custom then is 
<page:683>
with his handkerchief and said, "This is a very dirty House." And so that farce ended. What would the member for Bruce do then? The House ought to vindicate itself, as the honour- able gentleman says. I have seen many such cases in this House during my parliamentary career, and I have always seen the thing end in an unsatisfactory way. No doubt there has been a breach of privilege in this case, but I have never seen any good result by carrying the matter to the bitter end. It is now proposed to set up a Committee. There is no doubt the circumstances of this case are of a most flagrant nature. It is one of the worst cases of breach of privilege that has ever come before the House within my knowledge, because here are the actual shorthand notes taken by the Com- mittee's parliamentary shorthand writer handod to the Dunedin Evening Star. Now, nothing can be stronger than that. I would not so much complain if the members of the Com- mittee had given their impressions or a précis of their proceedings to this paper. But in this case here are the shorthand writer's notes of the whole of the evidence handed over en bloc. Well, I think, speaking of it as a matter of privilege, it is the most impudent thing that has ever occurred since I have been in this House. While I do not want to allow the House to make itself ridiculous in this matter, I think the proposal to set up a Committee to provide the House with all the information required is a good one. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston). - I do not see any great harm in setting up this Committee. It will give the members of the Committee something to amuse themselves with during the session. They will be able to have a fish- ing-excursion or two to enable them to get at the root of the matter, and, as was stated by the member for Wellington City, they might have a cheap trip to Dunedin. But I certainly think it is a great farce to look at this matter in the same light as the member for Dunedin City (Mr. Barclay). He has evidently spent all the day looking up constitutional history, and constitutional law, and all that sort of thing, and, like all young members of the House, he has got a great idea of the dignity of Parlia- ment-"I, the member for Dunedin, and the dignity of the House that I belong to." When the honourable gentleman has been a little longer in Parliament, when he has learned a little more of the proceedings in reference to these questions of privilege, and more of what underlies the motives upon which action is taken, he will feel a very great con- tempt for anything like the raising of a ques- tion of privilege. Then, it depends to a very great extent upon who the sinner is. It de- pends also to a very great extent on the sort of politics the person who commits the offence holds, and it is very like suspending a member of Parliament : if he is a member supporting the Government of the day, well, he can com- mit almost any offence in this House and no notice is taken of it ; but if he is an opponent of those who support the Government, then he will find a Star Chamber erected and he will get his punishment, not for the offence which has been committed, but because of the politi- cal whims of those who surround him. An Hon. MEMBER .- Not in the case of the Dunedin Evening Star. Mr. PIRANI .- So far as the present case is concerned, it is not so much a question either of the paper publishing the information or of the reporter who got it, but it is more a ques- tion of who supplied the information, because the person who supplied the information must have known when it was supplied that he had no right to supply it ; and I say, as I said before, that I lay the fault to a very great ex- tent on the shoulders of the Committee them- selves, who evidently did their work in such a loose fashion that they have asked for this sort of offence to be committed. If a Commit- tee likes to take proper care of the reports of its proceedings, and if the members them- selves respect what goes on before the Com- mittee, there cannot possibly be any publica- tion of this sort, because, as has been pointed out, it is the actual shorthand re- porter's notes which have been published, and not a mere resume of the proceedings of the Committee. And I take exception altogether to the axiom laid down according to the Minister of Justice-that the publication of what goes on before Select Committees is in- duced by the presence before the Committees of members who do not belong to those Com- mittees. Why, one of the greatest sinners we ever had in this House in regard to the publica- tion of matters coming before the Committees was the Premier of this colony. Honourable members will remember the old Press room before it was pulled down, and will recollect that it was quite a common thing for certain members of the House to go to that Press room after meetings of the Committees were over, and to give information to the pressmen con amore, just as they pleased. An Hon. MEMBER .- NO. Mr. PIRANI .- It is a fact, and can be borne out by other pressmen in this House. It was never looked upon as a serious offence at all ; and to say that members who do not belong to Committees at all give away information is to talk utter nonsense, for there are hardly any members in this House who take the trouble to attend the meetings of the Committees. I regret that there are not more, because then those meetings of Committees would be of much more use than they are. But the ques- tion of ascertaining who is responsible for this report being published is undoubtedly putting the cart before the horse. If the Minister thinks it is desirable and the House thinks it is desirable that there should be an inquiry as to who divulged the proceedings it will not do very much harm, but it would not do a great deal of good. To invoke the mighty power of Parliament in cases of breach of privilege, even in the Old Country, is very much a thing of the 
<page:684>
guilty of a breach of privilege by the House, because that paper challenged a Minister to say outside what he had said in the House, the House laughed at the very idea of bringing the offender before the House, because they have no sympathy with this antediluvian form of pun- ishment. It is altogether out of date, and, however much the professor of constitutional law may advocate such ideas, men of common- sense know that they have no effect. So long as it is a good report that is published-and in this case the Chairman of the Committee assures us that what was published was a fair report of what took place before the Committee- no great harm is done. And, if there is any- thing on which light should be shed by the Press in regard to what is being inquired into by this House, it is what has gone on in connection with these dredging companies, and that is one reason why I am not sorry that this question of privilege has been raised, for it will direct the attention of honour- able members to what is going on before that Committee. If this question had not been raised the Committee would have reported, the evidence would perhaps not have come before the House at all, and the whole thing would have ended in smoke. Now, this matter has aroused the attention of the House to the question before the Committee, and it will arouse attention in the country, and much more thought and consideration will be devoted to the alleged evils complained of than would have been the case had the matter been dealt  32106019788246 with in the ordinary course. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton). - The motion now before the House is that a Commit- tee be set up to inquire into the matter of the publication of evidence, which publication con- stituted a breach of privilege. Now, Sir, I am not aware, from the Standing Orders, that there could be a breach of privilege in an officer of the Committee giving this evidence. The whole gravamen of the offence is the publication. That publication has already been declared by the House to be a breach of privilege. The Stand- ing Orders say that it shall be a breach of pri- vilege for any member of the Committee or any other person to publish evidence taken before a Select Committee which Committee has not reported to the House. Then, the question comes, What course is the House going to take, having already affirmed that a breach of pri- vilege in this behalf has been committed? Are we going to do anything at all? What can be the object of setting up a Committee ? All the Committee can do is to try and ascertain how the reporter of the Dunedin Star obtained the information. Supposing it should be ascer- tained that he obtained it from one of the officials of the Committee, the House will not be in any better position, except that it will be the duty of the Government to dismiss the official who is guilty of handing over the evi- dence. On the other hand, the Committee would, no doubt, have the power to call upon the reporter of the Star, put him on his oath, Mr. Pirani formation, it would be the business of the Com- mittee to report to the House, and the House would deal with him in the ordinary course for contumacy. This seems to be the position which would naturally follow. But after all this investigation has taken place the House would be no nearer than it is now, it having affirmed that a breach of privilege has taken place. I should like the Minister for Railways. in the course of his reply, to indicate what good purpose he expects to follow from the setting- up of the Committee-what is the object of it ? If it is merely to provide a means of retreat to the paper from the probable results of its action in committing a breach of privilege, let us under- stand plainly and straightforwardly that that is the object. If, on the other hand, he pro- poses to set up the Committee to ascertain whether an official has been guilty of handing the information over, I have already shown he would be able to accomplish nothing but the dismissal of the erring official. So far as I am concerned, I have been connected with the Press of the colony for a great number of years, but while I hold a seat in the House I consider the honour of the House to be far greater to me than any professional connection I have with the journalism of the colony. I do not sympa- thize at all with the remarks of the honourable member for Wairarapa, who spoke from & journalistic point of view, as if it ought to be the duty of the House to stand by and see its dignity set aside and then laugh at it. I do not wish to dwell on this point; I merely rose for the purpose of saying that I trust the Minister will explain how far he proposes to carry the matter. If the proposal to set up a Committee is to provide a way out by the back-door for the paper, let us understand what we are doing. If, on the other hand, it is intended as a genuine effort to provide means of ascertaining on whom the responsibility must lie for the breach of privilege, I say that is already settled by the House in the motion that a breach of privilege has taken place. Mr. McNAB (Mataura) .- I think the honour- able gentleman in charge of the motion can well defend the proceedings he adopted. I do not think it follows that his resolution is out of place. In the first place, I would refer honourable members to the "Rulings of the Speakers " already quoted from. On page 156 they will find, "The first motion moved should be that a breach of privilege has been com- mitted. If that is affirmed, then a further reso- lution is moved." Honourable members will remember, in spite of this being laid down by Mr. Speaker O'Rorke, there is one other method by which the House proceeds : it appoints a Committee to go into the evidence and report to the House whether a breach has been com- mitted. If honourable members would only listen until I have settled the point they will then be able to understand the position. At the present time I am settling this question. Now, in place of the procedure which was adopted in 1874, this House has this after- 
<page:685>
it has declared that a breach of privilege has been committed. What is the next step to take? Let us look at the Standing Orders of the House, as interpreted by the ruling of the Speaker, and see if the Hon. the Colonial Secretary is not in order in intro- ducing this motion. Looking in page 157 of the Rulings, we find No. 13 :- "The House first decides whether a breach of privilege has taken place, then hears explanation of the person accused, then decides whether it will proceed further or not." Our next business after declaring that a breach of privilege is committed is to make provision for hearing the person accused, and the best way in which the House can hear the explana- tion of the person accused is to ask that person to appear and give evidence before a Committee, which will report to the House. Hon. MEMBERS. - NO. Mr. McNAB .- Sir, I am not responsible for the ability of the honourable member for Riccarton to follow logical argument, but it is not necessary at all that the accused person should be brought to the bar of the House and there give his explanation. The person accused can equally well give an explanation before a Committee of the House ; and it is the duty of that Committee, having heard the explanation of the person accused, to bring down its report to the House, and then is the time for the House to decide what the next step to be taken is: whether the House ought to punish the person who is accused ; and if it is to punish him what the nature of that punishment will be, or whether the circumstances surrounding the breach of privilege are such as not to #cc-zero warrant further action. This Committee which is being set up by the resolution before the House will bring down a recommendation to this effect, and then the House will proceed, or decide that no further action shall be taken. Regarding the general question of whether we ought to open our Committees to the reporters of the different papers, I am one of those who hold that our Committees ought to be as open as, at any rate, the Courts of the land. If we open our highest Courts of the land to the newspaper reporters, then what have we got in this House and in the hearings before the Committees that we should debar the reporters from appearing ? It need not follow that because in this House the proceedings of the House are privileged- and then, again, they are only privileged to the official publication of the House - therefore the privilege will attach to the reports that re- porters may send to their papers of the pro- ceedings of the Committees ; and, if no privileges attach to the report, who, then, will be injured by any publication ? That is my opinion, and that is the direction in which I will vote if the question is brought up for an amendment of our Standing Orders; but at the present time there is no proposal before the House to deal with our Standing Orders. We have decided the question that a breach of privilege has occurred, and I believe we ought not to stop at punishment will be inflicted in the event of the Dunedin Star not being able to give a satis- factory explanation-which I hardly see can be done-of what appears in its columns. But I believe, myself, that the method which the honourable member who is leading the House at the present time has suggested is the best course we can follow, and that we should require the publisher of the Dunedin Star to appear before a Select Committee, and let that Com- mittee report to this House, and then the House can decide what punishment it will mete out. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) .- Sir, an attempt has been made to show that the breach of privilege case which occurred in 1874 has no bearing on the case before the House. Sir, I am willing to admit that on one point the two cases are not exactly parallel-that is, that in the case now before the House the House has decided that a breach of privilege has been committed ; whereas in the case in 1874 the matter was referred to the Speaker of the Legislative Council, who ruled that, in his opinion, "a gross breach of privilege had been committed," and he recommended that a Committee should be set up to inquire and report, and a Committee was set up accord- ingly. There are a number of members who have expressed the opinion that it is not competent for the House to set up such a Committee, because the House had already affirmed the fact that a breach of privilege had been committed. But according to a ruling of Mr. Speaker's, quoted by the honour- able member for Mataura, the first motion should be, "That a breach of privilege had been committed," and if that is affirmed a further That is exactly resolution must be moved. what is now being done. Some members who have spoken seem to think there is only one issue involved. Sir. there is more than one issue involved. The member for Dunedin City (Mr. Barclay) expressed the opinion that only one person was responsible, and that that person was the publisher of the journal. Sir, is not the party who supplied the information equally responsible ? I submit he is ; and we want to know who supplied the information, and with that object it is proposed to set up a Committee, and I consider the order of reference covers everything that is required. I will read the finding of the Committee in the case that has been quoted. "The Committee find that Mr. - , a wit- ness before the last-named Committee, gave the information to Mr. - , a member of the House of Representatives, who telegraphed the article to the Southern Cross newspaper at Auckland on Sunday last, the 2nd instant, and that the said article was reproduced as a Press telegram in the Wellington Tribu e newspaper of the 4th instant. Your Committee are of opinion that a breach of privilege, for which Mr. - and Mr. - are primarily responsible, has been committed by the publication of this telegram." That is to say, the Committee inquired into the breach of privilege and discovered who the 
<page:686>
this case. We want to discover who the guilty parties are, and, if the Committee discover the names, they will report them to the House, so that the House may deal with them as it thinks fit. Mr. BARCLAY (Dunedin City) .- Sir, I de- sire to make a personal explanation. I under- stand the honourable member represented me as saying that no one was liable to punishment in this case but the publisher. Of course, I never said anything of the sort. I never dreamt of it. I said that, whoever was not responsible, the publisher certainly was responsible for the pub- lishing, and the House had so decided. I con- tend that the publisher is the one person who we certainly know is responsible, whoever might not be. Mr. MASSEY (Franklin) .- Sir, by way of explanation, I would like to say that I took down the words as they were spoken by the honourable member. The words used were, "The only person who is responsible is the publisher." I think the honourable member will not deny that I am correct. Motion agreed to. Sir J. G. WARD .- It has been suggested to me that the member for Bruce being a mem- ber of the Goldfields and Mines Committee, it would, perhaps, be better if some other member of the House took his place on the Committee of privilege. Mr. J. ALLEN .- I would rather not sit on the Committee. Sir J. G. WARD .- I move, That the name of Mr. Pirani be substituted for that of Mr. J. Allen. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- Sir, I submit the time for amending the motion has gone past. Mr. J. ALLEN .- I wish to ask leave to with- draw from the Committee. Mr. DEPUTY - SPEAKER. - The amend- ment can only be made with the indulgence of the House, and, under the circumstances, I do not suppose any member would object to the Minister for Railways moving the amendment. Mr. BARCLAY (Dunedin City) .- I would like to point out that the member for Palmerston expressed some strong opinions on the subject this afternoon. He is also connected with a newspaper as proprietor. He has expressed the opinion that these cases never come to any- thing, which is not quite correct. I think it would be better to select some honourable member who has not expressed such a very decided opinion on the question. Sir J. G. WARD .- I feel sure that the honourable member will, on reflection, see that what he has suggested is scarcely fair. An honourable member from the opposite side ought to be on the Committee, and he should be one of experience. I did not select the honourable member for Palmerston because he is a news- paper proprietor, but because he is an intelli- gent member on that side of the House. Amendment agreed to. Mr. Massey Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) .- Sir, when 7.30. the debate was adjourned on Friday evening last I was speaking, and the Premier attempted to prevent me going further by urging his colleague the Minister for Public Works to move the adjournment of the debate. The result of that would have been that I would have been excluded from making any further remarks ; but fortunately that was frustrated. I had been alluding to the fact that the Right Hon. the Premier and Colonial Treasurer had ended the year on the 31st March last with a deficit in the Public Works Fund of something like £260,000. I do not know that it has ever occurred before in the history of New Zealand that we were unable to meet our liabilities at the end of the financial year, either by loans in hand or by loans authorised. Neither by loans authorised nor by money in hand had the Pre- mier sufficient money to meet this liability. and I think it may be said to be a dishonest action on the part of the Treasurer or on the party of the colony to incur liabilities with- out having money to meet them. I had also alluded to the enormous power of borrow. ing money that had been placed in the hands of the Colonial Treasurer for the current year. and I stated it to be no less than, including the balance in hand, including loans already authorised, and including the two millions which he proposed to ask for this year-I say I stated that the amount available during the current year was no less than $5,000,000 sterling. The Premier, however, denied that; and it will. therefore, be necessary for me to give deta .. to show that that is correct. Under the Cor- solidated Stock Act of 1884 the Premier is authorised during the current year to borrow money by means of debentures for the sinking fund, say, to the extent of $50,000; under the Government Loans to Local Bodies Act, be can borrow $200,000 without appropriation. under the Act of 1886; he has authority. with the appropriation of Parliament, to borrow $50,000 under the Act of 1891; he has the authority, without the appropriation of Parlia- ment, to borrow, under the Act of 1898. another $250,000 : making altogether. under the Govern- ment Loans to Local Bodies Acts, EMwww. Under "The Land for Settlements Act. 190)." he has power to borrow the balance of the sim not borrowed last year, amounting to. Mv. $281,000 ; and under the same Act this year he can borrow another $500,000-making 57-1.00 under the Land for Settlements Act of 190 Under the New Zealand Consols Acts. 144 and 1900, he has authority to raise another $294,000. Under the Government Advan .::: to Settlers Act he had a balance on the 31 .: March last of $620,000, and, with the new kat this year of a million, that will give her £1,620,000. Under the Aid to Public Works and Land Settlement Act the balance = the 31st March was £800,000, and, as he po- poses to ask for a new loan of a mi ... that will make £1,800,000. Under " Tb" Dairy Industry Act, 1898," he has author:) 
<page:687>
Insurance Act of 1899 he has authority to borrow $25,000 : making a total for the cur- rent year of £5,100,000. I allude to this in order that honourable members may see how largely we have come to depend upon borrowed money, and to show that the State now is living upon borrowed money. If a check takes place now or at any time upon our power to borrow, our whole scheme falls to the ground, and this from a Government which professes to be a non-borrowing, self-reliant Govern- ment. They have led us into a greater scheme of borrowing, into wilder schemes of borrowing, and into a greater reliance upon borrowing than any Government that has existed in this colony before. I also referred to the question of the present being an unfavourable time for going upon the money-market. The Premier has taken great credit to himself for raising a loan of half a million at 4 per cent. locally. Now, I calculated the interest that that loan would yield for the first year, and I find it amounts to over 44 per cent. I looked up the Act and found that we are only authorised to borrow this money on such terms that the debentures would yield to the debenture-holders only 4 per cent. They have sold those debentures to yield to the purchaser 4} per cent. for the first year- illegally, I say. Honourable members will find on page viii. of this Statement this curious expression : " To complete the security required by the investors, 1,658 debentures have been printed," and I wish to know why those words "have been printed " have been inserted. One would think that if the security was given to the debenture-holders the Premier would have used the word "issued." The fact is that they are illegal, and that is why they are not issued. Sir J. G. WARD .- What debentures ? Mr. J. ALLEN .- The debentures to secure the half-million loan borrowed in the colony. I wish to find out what the effect of this loan has been. The Premier said the best thing would be to borrow locally, and to a certain extent and under certain conditions I admit it. But it has its evil effects, and the effects have already been felt by the banks and those requiring money. I will just give one instance. The Corporation of Wellington were trying to secure a loan from the Australian Mutual Pro- vident Society, and the only one condition on which they could not agree was this : That the A.M.P. Society desired the Corporation of Wel- lington to pay the interest in Australia. Upon that point they did not agree ; and there was a chance of their coming to some agreement until the A. M.P Society got their money lent to the Government at 4 per cent., the interest to be paid on the other side. And now the Corpora- tion of Wellington, I have no doubt, will be left in the lurch, because this money has been taken by the Government at a higher rate than the Corporation were making terms for with the A.M.P. Society. I could give other instances of the effect of local loans being raised in New Zealand and on the "other side." The Bank of New South Wales, for instance, is now raising their rate of interest upon de- their interest upon advances lent to their cus- tomers. The Government have been preach- ing about cheap money, but this is not the way to obtain cheap money. Now I have to refer briefly to the London issue, in order to show how unfavourable the times are for raising money at Home. During the June quarter we find that £500,000 of money was borrowed at par, the cost being £3,160, while the loan locally raised only cost £1,650. And I have a few words with regard to the £500,000 which has been borrowed from the Public Trustee, being moneys repaid on account of the Bank of New Zealand pre- ference shares. I want to ask why it is that in one of our Public Accounts this money is put down as invested by the Public Trustee in Government securities at 3 per cent. In B .- 10 of this year, being a return showing the public securities of the colony, the investment of the Public Trustee is put down as a security of the colony at 3 per cent., and that return is signed by the Controller and Auditor-General ; but there is another return, B .- 11, which is not signed by the Auditor-General, but which is signed only by the Public Trustee, where we find that very sum put down as a security at 3} per cent. I have but little time to refer to the Bank of New Zealand and the question which the Premier has raised with regard to the Bank of New Zealand dividend. If I had time I could show that the Minister for Railways, when the original Bill was before the House- and the Premier too-made it one of the con- ditions of the agreement that this dividend should be paid as soon as it possibly could be paid ; and yet the Premier the other evening said that action would be taken which would deprive the shareholders of the possibility of securing the dividend. I wish to refer now to one more point with regard to the raising of money in London. The Colonial Treasurer some years ago denied a statement of Mr. Duthie, then member for Wellington City, that the Stock Exchange were not quoting our 3-per-cents, which was partly true and partly untrue. They do quote a certain number of our 3-per-cents ; but even to-day they do not quote the whole of our 3-per-cents. They do quote the whole of our loans on the Stock Exchange in London, except $2,526,620 of our 3-per-cents, which they do not quote at all ; and I say these difficulties will have to be removed be- fore we can hope to go successfully on the Lon- don market and secure our money, even when the better times do come. Then, I will also refer to the fact of the non-settlement of the Mid- land Railway question, and its effect upon our position in London. The time has come when the Premier ought to deal with this question, and settle the matter honourably for the colony, so that there may be no drawback in this respect to our borrowing money in London. I will refer only for a few moments to the question of old-age pensions. The Premier originally, speaking on this question, estimated that the amount required for old-age pensions for the first year would be $90,000 ; for the second year, $90,000; third year, $108,000; 
<page:688>
but in a little over three years we are already paying, or propose to pay for this year, £215,000 for old-age pensions-just about double the estimate for the third year. The Premier originally made a promise to the House that he would bring down a scheme to provide for contributions being made by those who were to receive the pension. An Hon. MEMBER. --- NO. Mr. J. ALLEN .- Yes; at page 540 of Han- sard, Volume 103, Mr. Seddon said,- "I have promised that I will, if I am able, endeavour to submit a scheme outside this, dealing with the questions of assurance and insurance on the lines of that in connection There is with the British Post Office. no difficulty, I say, in that legislation being passed subsequently to this old-age pensions scheme." That scheme has never yet been produced before the colony, and the time has now come -and, indeed, has long gone past-when the Premier should have fulfilled his promise that the old-age pensions scheme should be put on a better basis than it is at present. Now, in regard to the investment of departmental funds in Government securities I have this to say : that the bulk of departmental funds are in- vested in our own Government securities. For instance, the Post Office funds amount to nearly six millions and three-quarters, and of that amount six millions of money is in- vested in our own Government securities, and only £725,000 out of six millions and three- quarters is invested outside the Government security, and I say that is a doubtful policy. But I am not going to dwell on that as being as of much importance as the other point, and that is this : that the Government are utilising Government funds at 3 per cent., whereas by going to London or by going to the local people here they pay 4 per cent., and have to give them special conditions and advantages to get their money. Yet, at the same time, we are taking from our Post-Office Savings-Bank and from the Government Life Insurance their funds at 3 per cent., and I wish to point out what the effect has been. The effect on the Post Office, I think, has been disastrous. The amount of 3-per-cents now held by the Post Office is $1,879,614. The interest has fallen to the depositors, and the amount which is being paid by way of interest is falling year by year, and now the Government are only able to pay for certain sums 3 per cent., and that amount will have to be decreased still further if we are going to continue to invest the funds of the Post-Office Savings-Bank in our own Government securities at 3 per cent. Then, what is the effect with regard to the Govern- ment Life Insurance Office. The Government Life Insurance have $625,900 of 3-per-cents, and the interest for the period from the 31st December, 1897, to the 31st December, 1898, fell 2s. 8d. per cent. From the 31st December, 1898, to the 31st December, 1899, it fell 2s 10d. per cent., and from the 31st December, 1899, to the 31st December, 1900, it fell 1s. 11d. per cent. Mr. J. Allen this period the Government commenced to take from the Government Life Insurance money at 3 per cent., and the result to-day is this: that the funds invested by the Government Life Insurance Department are earning £4 9s. 2d., whereas the funds of the A.M.P. Society are earning £4 13s. 4d. And, if that is so, can the Government go on competing with the A.M.P. Society, offering equal advantages to those who deal in the Government Life Insurance Depart- ment? It cannot be done, Sir. They cannot pay the same bonuses that the A.M.P. Society are paying, and it is placing the Government Department in an unfair position as regards competition. I regret I have little time left, as you have just rung your bell on me, Sir, but I fear that this large depend- ence on borrowed money is becoming a very serious menace to the colony. I fear the heavy taxation which has been imposed on us, al- though we have been able to bear it during the "fat " years, may be a very difficult thing to bear during the "lean " years, if we happen to get some. I fear, Sir, that the interest on borrowed money, which has been increasing, this year will increase. The estimate is that it will increase this year some £70,000. I fear that is a menace to the safety of the colony ; and this immense dependence on borrowed money is, in my opinion at any rate, a very serious thing for the colony. And, Sir, this has come from those who profess to be able to carry on without this great dependence upon loan-money from outside, or from inside either. And, Sir, it is the same with everything else- they profess, but they never practise : and if the Right Hon. the Premier were here to-night I should have to say something about his profes- sions with regard to those who have been of great service to the colony during the last two years - those who have been fighting our battles in South Africa. Everybody knows how the Premier has paraded "our boys at the front." and on every platform in the colony he has made political capital out of them. I recollect the Premier's patriotism about twelve years ago. It was the patriotism of separation, and the patriotism of elective Governor, and to-day, Sir, I say-although I will not say what I should say if the Premier were here-I say that he is parading "our boys at the front " merely for political purposes, and that alone, and I will prove it to the Premier when he is present. I will not take advantage of him in his absence, but when he is present in the House I shall prove, I think, to the House and to the country that he has simply been using our boys who have gone to the front solely for political pur- poses, and that he cares no more about them than he cares about everybody else ; he only cares when he can utilise them for his own political advantage. An Hon. MEMBER .- You know nothing about it. Mr. J. ALLEN .- I do know something about it, and I shall say what I know when the Premier is here. I will not say it to-night. Sir, I think that this Financial Statement 
<page:689>
the colony ought to be awakened to a know- ledge of the position we have drifted into -a position in which we are unable to meet our liabilities, a position in which no pro- vision has been made for our liabilities. I say I do not know that there has ever been a time in the history of the colony when the Colonial Treasurer has been placed in the position of having to go to the foreign money-lender ad- mitting, "We have so much liabilities and we cannot meet them, and we have to come to you for aloan." Is it a favourable condition under which to go to the outside money-lender for a loan of money when you have to tell him that you have exceeded all the money available, and that you have incurred liabilities which you have no means to meet ? Supposing you could not borrow the money in London or here, what would become of the £260,000 extra liabilities to meet which there are no ways and means at present available ? Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- Time is up. Mr. WITHEFORD (Auckland City) .- I had not the slightest intention of speaking, but I would like to say a few words chiefly directed to the question of the position of the working- men of New Zealand, and of the industrial classes, and of our industries and of our manu- factures. An Hon. MEMBER .- We cannot hear you. Mr. WITHEFORD .- I must ask the indul- gence of the House to-night, for, like many more of my fellow-members, I have been laid up for the last few days. In regard to the  question of the industrial position of New Zealand, I ask, Why should not the same spirit of Ministerial prestige as is given to military matters be given to the establish- ment of industries? Let us provide an alter- native for the periodical stagnation and depres- sion which have ever occurred, and which will otherwise be actually brought about by the well-meant policy of the present Government. In proportion to the check given to private capitalists and industrial concerns, so the State should provide a counterbalancing system by which workers will not between two stools come to the ground and be left without any work at all. The working-man cannot regulate finance or control financial concerns, and the law- makers who introduce regulations which in- crease the cost of production should be pre- pared to show that they can produce on the same system, to prove that they are going on practical lines. I would like the Go- vernment to lay down a practical system in regard to each form of industry they think necessary to interfere with, and show how articles for sale or export can be produced at a profit within the four corners of the Acts, or proposed Acts, affecting these in- dutsries. The Government have individual ability of high order, and high enough to devise and carry out a more up-to-date busi- ness policy. The railway - formation should also be carried out on commercial lines, and run parallel with land-settlement, the pro- secution of one leading to .the successful VOL. CXVII .- 43. should be carried out more energetically in the interests of the whole colony, because mining communities provide the best cash markets for the settlers' produce. Development should be carried on on more practical and go-ahead lines than in the past. If men can be sent Home in order to marshal our business and arrange for the sale of our produce, I fail to see why the same plan should not be carried out in regard to goldfields development, nor why specially qualified men should not be sent to the goldfields to make them more productive, directly and indirectly. Then, there are raw materials which can be obtained in different parts of the colony; all this should be made the basis of industrial works ; we should start first one and then another department in accordance with their merit. The reducing of rates of interest is clearly borne by people dependent on their incomes, and with trade and industries the reduction of profits on manufactures will mean reduction of wages. Such is the traditional effect shown in the past on trade in the case of individuals, and it will doubtless prove the same in the case of the country ; the business of a country is only the business of thousands of individuals rolled into If revenues are cut off and unproductive one. expenditure increased, sooner or later the State employés will have their wages cut down, just as people have their incomes cut down through the reduction of interest. I feel we have not paid sufficient attention as a Parliament to the industries of the colony. The prevailing ten- dency of our legislation is so to hamper the industries in connection with the Factories and other Acts that there will be a percentage of loss in connection with the products of the colony, instead of a percentage of gain. The consequence is the colony will be placed in the position of the old woman and her apples : she lost a little on every apple she sold, but she said that it was the quantity she sold made up for the loss. If each industry is to be attacked so that the goods we produce cannot compete with those outside, it means that the greater our manufactures become the greater will be the loss to those who have money in- vested in them. A constant stream of money is required to turn the colonial wheel of pro- sperity. If Government could arrange to pump that stream of wealth out of our own gold- fields, they would at the same time turn the whole of the wheels of every other local industry in the colony. That is why I should be very pleased if the Minister of Mines would give greater attention to a more speedy development of the goldfields, because, though we cannot always command the markets of the Old World, we are benefited by strong internal markets, such as those of the goldfields, which provide the best market for the settlers' produce, and are, therefore, worthy of every encouragement. Personally, I am a supporter of the Government, and I am going to continue to support them ; but when there is a slight tendency to visionary legislation, and a failure to pay sufficient atten- tion to providing reproductive work for the 
<page:690>
late them to doing something practical in the interests of the workers. Anything I 8.0. say against the present Government in regard to the stagnation of trade that periodi- cally comes on the colony applies with equal force to my friends on the other side of the House. I will tell members why I say so : Some ten or twelve years ago, when a similar difficulty was faced in the colony, and the miners were leaving our goldfields, I came to Wellington and saw the late Sir Harry Atkin- son and some members of his Government, and pointed out to them that shipload after ship- load of experienced miners were leaving the northern goldfields for Australia and other parts of the world to develop the mineral resources. Sir Harry Atkinson promised to see that some- thing was done by means of which the ex- perienced miners whose knowledge and service were of such value in the development of the goldfields of the colony, should be retained in the country. I suggested to him that practi- cal use should be made in the first instance of the Geological Department, and that the men should be sent to investigate the position of the different auriferous districts of the colony. They should find out what mines had been partially developed, and see that proper treat- ment was being given to the ores of the district, and point out to people who were spending money whether they were spending it so as to obtain the best results from their work. As I mentioned the other day, one mine in Auck- land-the Waihi-was not being properly run at one time. They were not treating the ore in  a proper manner, with the result that it was returning only 3 dwt. to the ton; but we find that under a different treatment last month's return from the mine was valued at £38,000, and every month the average value of the mine is now over £30,000. That mine, as I have said, was much neglected at one time ; but on account of one young man with expert know- ledge going to the field the system of treat- ment was improved, and the mine has produced gold to the value of two millions sterling in the last ten or twelve years. There are a number of other properties in a similar position between Wellington and Auckland ; and I maintain that if the Government would take action to demon- trate the value of our mineral resources-let the honourable gentleman take up the mining industry first of all, and let other Ministers deal with other industries later on-the result would be similar to that achieved at Waihi. The goldfields of the colony would turn out large quantities of gold. Many mines that are nowy returning nothing at all would be made to produce handsomely, and in that way much good would be done to the colony, for every one knows how valuable a goldfield is to a country. An Hon. MEMBER .- What about the Royal Oak ? Mr. WITHEFORD .- It is said that mine is not being treated in a proper manner; but £50,000 has been spent to develop it, and, al- though it has turned out gold valued at £50,000, much good might yet be done for it by the Mr. Witheford also be done in other parts by instructing the people to use the right plant, and to so treat the ore that the best results would be obtained. Sir, I feel rather reluctant to take up the time of the House to-night ; I am not in proper form to address the House. I consider, however, it is the duty of members to point out to the Ministry that we should give more practical stimulus to industries, for pre-eminently the great question of the age is the profitable employment of the people ; yet it is probably the subject to which we give proportionately the least attention. We are all to blame, more so than the members of the Government, if we do not strengthen their hands as much as lies in our power. As far as I am concerned, I shall do what I can on behalf of the province I come from. In the North Island we have gold enough to pay off the national debt of the colony if the Government will only go to the trouble of devising some satis- factory scheme for getting it out of the ground. The colony has already produced gold to the value of $56,000,000, which is far in excess of its national debt. The English people could not turn that amount of gold out of England for the reason that they have not got it. L.et the world know that we have mineral wealth. which, if properly developed, could make us in- dependent of the foreign money-lender. In re- gard to gold production, I would like to say that I believe the Minister of Mines is a good, practi- cal man, and that if he set to work he could de- vise a system by which the unemployed miners of the colony could be made to produce gold ad- vantageously to the country. I say, Sir, that it would be far better to set them to work to de- velop these hidden treasures that we have all over the country than to allow them to leave our shores. Our miners have a far better know- ledge of the auriferous conditions of the districts in which they are located than any man im- ported from other countries can possibly have, and if we permit them to leave, we suffer an irreparable loss. In any one of these men we may be losing a Sir John Mckenzie, an R. J. Seddon, or a Minister of Mines like the Hon. Mr. McGowan. I believe the Hon. the Minis- ter will make a name for himself in this country if he will only rouse up and stimulate the goldfields industry. Apart from the wealth the miners would produce, every man would be valuable as a settler, and a taxpayer, and a contributor to the population. Is it right that the Government, who are talking about a de- creasing population, should sit quietly and see our able-bodied miners leaving the goldfields, simply because English capital is being with- drawn ? I say, Sir, that it is wrong to do so. There is no better market in the world for the sale of produce than on a successful goldfield. When we consider the immense amount of auriferous country between Wellington and Auckland, and the rich gold-mines already opened up in Auckland; when we take into consideration the Urewera-country and the Kaimanawa Ranges, I say it is a great pity that nothing has been done to develop that rich country. Instead of showing timidity in regard 
<page:691>
proud that we have such wealthy resources, which only await the strong arm of the working- man for development, and the guiding hand of the Ministry. Sir, I think that we have now had quite sufficient of military glory, and I would like to see the Government making an effort to popularise industrial, agricultural, and mechanical glory. I would like to see something done in the direction of inspiring our young men to take off their coats and engage more in mechanical pursuits. And when any new industry is started I would like to see the Government go with a band, to inspire our young men, just as they did when they went to see our young men off to fight the Boers. Get them to make the young fellows feel de- lighted at having the patronage of the Govern- ment by feeling that attention is being directed to these pu suits. So much can, I think, be done by Parliament and the Government to popularise peaceful pursuits and to encourage our young men to get to work earnestly that I hope the matter will be given our most serious attention. Nowadays there is too much tendency to indulge in politics. There is too much de- sire for the glories of war, and too many of our young men want clerks' billets, so that they can keep their coats on. We want to get that de- sire out of the minds of our young men. They should feel as much pleasure in mining, agri- cultural, and mechanical pursuits. Mr. HUTCHESON .- Why do you not have a go at that kind of work yourself ? Mr. WITHEFORD. - I have done it myself, and I am just as proud of having done that kind of work as of any other. Now, in regard to land-settlement questions, I know that most   honourable members could teach me a good deal more upon that subject than I know myself, and I shall not refer to it further than to say, as a member for Auckland City, that I find there is nothing mentioned in the State- ment in connection with expenditure in that direction in the Auckland Province. We find that large sums have been expended in other parts of the colony in the purchase of lands. We were told some little time ago that a sum of £700,000 was spent in Canterbury upon close settlement. Now, I do not object to money being expended in the South, because I consider that the prosperity and progress of the South is intimately connected with the welfare of the North; but at the same time I say that the settlement of the enormous areas of waste lands in the North Island will ad- vance the interests of the whole colony. Those lands require to be surveyed and alternate lines of railroad run through them, and the sections should be cut up in accordance with their suitability for occupation in small or large areas, so that those who take up the smaller sections may, while improving their land, find work on the larger areas. A scheme of that sort would be something practical, and would be far better than continuing the experimental legislation that has taken up so much of our time during the last session or two. I know that the Government are capable of carrying is my duty to urge them to push this colony ahead, and that is not to be done by introducing the class of legislation we have had during the last few weeks in this House. It is. simply setting class against class. Let us have a few years' trial of the legislation already on the statute-book, because if we go on piling up legislation of a similar character it may only have the effect of undoing all the good we have already done. We require to give a few years' trial to existing legitimate legislation, and instead of breaking down industrial structures, to rear greater temples of industry in our midst, so that every one in the colony who wants work may get it. By a practical arrangement we ought to be able to take another 500,000 men in this country and find them work, be- cause our resources-our raw material-are so great and our climate is so favourable that there should be no difficulty whatever in making New Zealand the great manufacturing centre of the Pacific. But we cannot accomplish that by placing restrictions upon every little industry that has started, and making it difficult for the people to produce goods at a price that will pay and enable them to compete with the outside world. If the Government think people are going to put their money into industries and go on manufacturing goods at a loss they aro very much mistaken. And if the Government policy is right in connection with those restric- tions, let them prove it by showing that it is possible for people to produce goods at a price which will enable them to get some return and also pay their men the current rates of wages - let them show that that can be done while keeping within the four corners of the re- strictive measures they have passed. I regret very much that I did not hear the speech of the member for Hawke's Bay, because I have a very great regard for the other side of the House. As I have stated, I am very friendly with the members of the present Go- vernment, and yet, as Lord Salisbury said, "I am on friendly terms with foreign Powers." The Minister of Lands, I believe, is firm in his determination to remedy the gross neglect which has characterized the action of the Government during the past ten years. With regard to the treatment of the North of Auckland, I believe his intention is to rapidly open the Crown lands in the North Island and hasten the settlement of the country, and I believe if he does that he will save the position of the Government, espe- cially if he is backed up by his worthy col- leagues the Minister for Public Works and the Minister of Mines. There is any amount of pastoral land which is waiting to be occupied, and which if taken up will carry several million inore sheep and cattle than we have at present in the colony ; and that will mean employing men in fencing, and in other ways, and thus will greatly tend to increase the prosperity of the colony. Then, the Minister of Mines could also employ large numbers of men in digging for gold, in which case we shall not need to go to the London money-market ; but, on the other hand, we shall become lenders. 
<page:692>
money to other nations. I think the Minister for Public Works is one of the best working-men in the Ministry. He devotes himself steadfastly to his work, and I believe his intention is to expedite the construction of the North of Auck- land line, and complete the North Island Main Trunk Railway within the next three years; and I hope to see the principal lines in other parts of the colony completed also. The Minister for Railways is one of the most able members of the Government, and runs his department in an efficient manner. I am ex- ceedingly sorry that I have such a bad cold that I cannot dwell at such length as I should like upon the work they might do to promote industrial prosperity. in regard to the mail- service, I do not agree with the sentiments expressed by the Government. With respect to encouraging the carriage of mails via Suez, my idea is that to bring our mails and pas- sengers by way of Australia means their per- colating through all the ports of Australia, coming to us second-hand, as it were, and their landing here a week later is a mistake. think the Premier said it would be a good idea to encourage steamers coming by the Suez Canal to Australia and New Zealand. In re- gard to the Fr'isco mail-service, I think that both on commercial lines and on grounds of defence it is a great service for this country. An Hon. MEMBER .- What about the Van- couver service ? Mr. WITHEFORD .- I think that in every respect the Fr'isco service is better than the Vancouver. It is quicker, and you would have that which is most important for every country to have-namely, an ally. When I tried to get the British Government to subsidise the mail- service from New Zealand, either by way of Fr'isco or Vancouver, they would not do it ; but they said, "Next to the British flag, we hope you will have your mails and passengers carried under the American flag, because the day will come when we shall work in unison," and therefore every effort during the last six or eight years with regard to mail connection has been on that suggestion. In regard to com- mercial allies, it is necessary for a colony situated in an isolated position like New Zea- land to have an ally. Colonies like New South Wales and Victoria are connected by rail on the great Australian Continent, but we depend entirely on water - carriage for our connection with the outside world. In the case of America we get a port five thou- sand miles nearer than any European port, and we have there seventy millions of people of the English-speaking race. They are great tra- vellers, and they are stretching out their hands into the Pacific. They have obtained the great ports of Honolulu and Samoa, and arrange- ments are in force which will enable New Zea- land to benefit by those ports. Of that I have not the slightest doubt. The Americans are making those ports great bases of supply. They have ordered 100,000 tons of coal from New Zealand for Samoa, and every three weeks they are getting fresh food from New Zealand Mr. Witheford through the whole of the South Sea Islands. New Zealand cannot hope to monopolise the trade of the South Sea Islands, and we cannot fence those islands round with a barbed-wire  fence and say we are the only nation which shall trade there. Therefore what we must do is to work in conjunction with some Power which is going to take up a great posi- tion in the commercial world, and work with them, and be, as it were, junior partners. I consider that by working in with the Ameri- can Government, by taking advantage of the Frisco mail-service and getting the benefit of the American subsidy of €50,000, we are act- ing on strictly business lines ; but we should not be doing so if we cut our connection with them, because they would then seek their ally in some other colony or State. I consider that on com- mercial grounds we cannot do better than work in strictly friendly unison with the American people, and when it comes to the question of defence the argument is very much stronger. What is the good of spending $60,000 or £600,000 in defending our ports here-what is 1 the good of it as compared with that little bit of bunting called "Old glory "- the Stars and Stripes - in conjunction with the Union Jack of England ? The Americans have their fleets of ironclads and cruisers in proximity to thee waters, and with a mail-service running undet the American flag, with our mails and pas. sengers being carried under it, there is thus always an alternative line, and in the event of hostilities it would be a great point for us New- Zealanders to be in friendly commercial alli- ance with so powerful a nation as America. The building of 10,000-ton steamers to connect with Australia and other parts I really thin's is unnecessary, when we have 6,000-ton boats already subsidised that come here and go across to Australia, and with the new ships being built for the Union Company, and the excel- lent fleet already run by the Union Company and the Huddart - Parker Company. With these I do not think there is any necessity for building 10,000-ton ships to connect with Australia. As regards railway-construction. I have already said all I wish to say about it- that it would be in the interests of the whole colony to push it on to the fullest possible extent. As regards the rolling - stock and \- material, I do think we ought to construct everything we possibly can in the colony. I am quite sure our friend the Minister for Railways will in the future, if possible, do what he has not done in the past-erect workshops with suf- ficient accommodation and with the necessary plant to build the required trucks, carriages, and locomotives, because when these industries are started they expand from year to year. Although the Government will not give bonuses for the establishment of different industries direct to the settlers of the colony, they are practically giving those bonuses to the foreign manufac- turers, and every £100,000 that is sent away for rolling-stock and material used in the Govern- ment service is a bonus given to the people in other countries to erect workshops. Goods of 
<page:693>
should be manufactured here, and it should be the first duty of the Government to see that every industry is put upon a prosperous footing, and to carry this out the Government should see that any legislation should not be in the direc- tion of hampering. but of fostering such industry. Mr. Speaker, and gentlemen, I thank you for the kindness with which you have listened to me to-night. You know, in the past, I never have taken up unduly the time of this House, and I felt so unequal to speaking that, had it not been for the earnestness I feel on this question of the unemployed being found work, I would not have spoken to-night. I consider it a pity, and a loss to any country, that there should be ten thousand men unemployed, -as is the case in almost every country in the world. If a man had a farm, and in one corner of it there were, say, a dozen men doing nothing from morning to night, you would say that was bad management. Here we have hundreds of men with nothing to do at all. It is not a matter of what the times are, but we know that the upsetting of a financial institution or the stopping of opera- tions of a mining company will often throw three or four hundred miners out of work. These men cannot start a mine, and I am sure that something could be done for them by the Government-that is, to select the richest of the mines that are partially de- veloped by foreign capital, make a test of the richness of the lodes, and see which would pay working-expenses, and put the men on these. If there is anything above working-expenses so much the better; but in any case it keeps these men employed until something turns up. When we consider that all the necessaries of life are grown by farmers, it will be seen that all that these men require to keep them living on a goldfield is produced in the colony, and that nothing is sent out of the colony at all. £53 per annum is the average earnings of men on the goldfields in this colony. A great many of them described on returns as miners are not working miners at all, but shoeblacks -as everybody on a goldfield puts themselves down as miners. This reduces the average earnings of the actual workers. Therefore there is a productive form of work on goldfields which, if carried on in a practical manner, must be for the good of the colony. I am satis- fied with the resources of New Zealand 8.30. from north to south if taken in hand by the Government in the proper manner. We can lay down a programme that would make New Zealand one of the richest and best countries in the world ; but it must be done by hard work, and by always producing something. Every man's labour should produce something towards the industrial wealth of the nation ; every man's labours needs to be turned to prac- tical account, and that is what the Minister of Mines is for, and that is what we are here for : to lay down some practical policy for developing the resources of the colony ; there is no use coming to the House and sleep- ing. If the Government take the thing properly would be one of the greatest manufacturing centres in the whole world. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton). - It is very surprising that, although two leading members of the Opposition have spoken, the My ex- Ministerial benches continue dumb. perience of some years in this House is, that. there has never been a speech on a Financial Statement which has so closely followed the course of financial politics as that delivered by the honourable member for Bruce. He showed throughout the whole of his speech great power of condensing facts regarding the finances ; he showed a grasp and grip of financial matters unexcelled by any member ; and I venture to say that speech deserved a reply from some leading member of the Government. That reply has not been given ; and the fact that the Government sit coolly by while that strong impeachment of their policy was uttered, and such powerful facts are adduced, indicates that they desire this debate should fizzle out. But the speeches that have been uttered already by the ex-leader of the Opposition and the mem- ber for Bruce are speeches that, whether the Government like it or not, will be read through- out the colony ; and, no doubt, the statement made by the honourable member for Bruce as to the present financial position of the colony will receive consideration both within and with- out New Zealand, and it is for the Government to justify their position in opposition to the statements he made. Sir J. G. WARD .- We can do that all right. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- I hope the Govern- ment will. I think the time to do so is when the statements are made. Now, in the earlier part of the Financial Statement the Treasurer devotes a large amount of attention to a criti- cism of newspaper remarks made in reference to the financial position of the colony. Ex- tracts are quoted from papers, and the writers are denounced as " penny-a-liners." Sir, who was responsible for the state of things which was referred to in the criticisms of the papers a few weeks ago ? I venture to say it was the Pre- mier. The whole responsibility of the Premier in connection with the matter is laid bare by him in the interview which has been freely quoted from, and which was reported in the Lyttelton Times by some one who happened to be there, and who evidently took a full short- hand note of the remarks of the Premier at that interview. Now, Sir, it is a matter of common report, from persons who attended that depu- tation to the Premier, that he made very important financial disclosures at that inter- view as to the position of the colony ; that was a matter of common report without going to the newspapers for it. But that was not the only instance. On two occasions in this House the Right Hon. the Premier said in so many words that the financial position of the colony was causing him the gravest anxiety, and that he had the greatest difficulty in making both ends meet. The remark that he made was this : He said on one occasion, " It is not that the revenue is not keeping up, but it is that 
<page:694>
meet." Then, Sir, coming on the top of a statement like this, we had the statement made throughout the colony, and not denied, first of all, that the Government had borrowed £100,000 from the A.M.P. Society at 4 per cent., with interest payable out of the colony, in order that the society might save paying in- come-tax. Shortly afterwards we had the fur- ther statement that the Government had bor- rowed from another insurance company trading in New Zealand the sum of £25,000 ; and these statements were so much in conflict with the al- legations of the Treasurer that at the close of the year he had a credit balance of £532,000, that people were alarmed at the idea that, within the course of three months, the Government, with such a vast surplus, was compelled to go, hat in hand, down Lambton Quay for the purpose of borrowing money in order to pay salaries in New Zealand. Sir, that was the position, and the responsibility for what the Premier com- plains of in the criticism of the newspapers as to the acute financial difficulty in this colony a few weeks ago, rests with the Premier, and not with these people he chooses to describe as "penny-a-liners." Now, Sir, in the course of the speech made by the member for Auckland City (Mr. Napier), who was put up by the Go- vernment to reply to Captain Russell, he used this term : "If the Conservative party came back to power." Sir, the Conservative party is never coming back to power ; that party, as a party, has disappeared for ever from the politics of New Zealand. At the election of  1890, and at the election of 1893, and the election of 1896, and the election of 1899, the country has declared against the old Conservative party as it existed. That is the position, Sir, without any doubt ; and, therefore, to raise this bogey of setting up the old Conservative party, as it existed in days past, as the alternative which the country has to fear-setting up the idea that if there is a change of Government that change will necessitate the abolition of the Advances to Settlers Department, of the land- for - settlements-policy, and other progressive planks that this country has adopted during the last ten years-is absurd. Whatever changes there may be-and, of course, changes there will be in connection with the politics of this country in time to come-these changes will be in the direction of a policy that shall combine progress with prudence and honesty of ad- ministration, and which will bring the country back to what I regard as the policy of the greatest statesman New Zealand has yet pro- duced-I mean the Hon. John Ballance -whose policy in 1891 was that of self-reliance, and independence of the London money-market. Now, Sir, let me refer very briefly to what was the actual position of the colony, as at the 31st of March last, as compared with the position the previous year. During the year ended the 31st March, the revenue of this colony increased by £272,000, but the expendi- ture increased by £340,000 ; and, if to that in- crease of $340,000 we add an increase of the Mir. G. W. Russell any member of the Government to controvert and prove to be wrong : that, compared with the previous year, the colony during the year ended 31st March, 1901, went to the bad to the extent of £141,000. I say that is the position as com- pared with the previous year. And, Sir, if we turn to the accounts for the quarter just ex- pired, the quarter ended the 30th June, we get still further light as to the actual financial posi- tion of the colony. Let me point out that the Gazette issued last Tuesday shows that at the beginning of the quarter there was £523,000 cash in the Public Account. At the end of the quarter there was a debit balance of $97,000, and the Treasurer starts the second quarter of the financial year £280,000 poorer on the Consolidated Account than he began the September quarter of last year with. And if we turn to the liabilities, we have a very strong side-light thrown on the Government finance. Honourable members will understand that the liabilities on the Consolidated Account represent the known and unpaid accounts as at the 31st March. In other words, they are the bills which the Government have in hand on that date and have not paid. In 1892, under the treasurership of the Hon. Mr. Ballance, the lia- bilities of the Consolidated Account amounted to £101,000. Last year they were $203,000, an increase of over $73,000 as compared with the previous year. In other words, on the 31st March, 1901, the Government had over $70,000 more unpaid accounts in hand than they had on the 31st March, 1900. Let me show honour- able members the departments in which the chief increases were. In the Colonial Secre- tary's department the liabilities were £6,000 more than in the previous year ; in the Post- master-General's department the liabilities were £7,000 more; in the departments of Minister for Railways the liabilities the were £16,000 more; the Defence Department's liabilities were $35,000 more; and the lia- bilities of the departments of the Minister of Lands were £5,000 more. These amounts show a total on the increase of the liabilities of £69,000, other departments making up the other £4,000 of the increase of liabilities. But, Sir, when we turn to the Public Works Fund, the liabilities in comparison with the previous year become absolutely colossal. These figures are not, perhaps, actual payments due, but they are commitments - that is, accounts owing, and engagements so far entered into that the colony will be compelled to pay the money sooner or later. What was the position in 1892, when Mr. Ballance was Treasurer ? The liabilities of the Public Works Fund on the 31st March, 1892, were #313,000. Last year they were £1,292,000. The increase during the year was made up in this way : The increase of liabilities as compared with the previous year was, on railways, $489.000 ; on roads, $131,000; on telegraph extension, £6,000; on buildings, £29,000 : on lighthouses, £7,000; and on contingent defence, £140,000: making a total increase, as compared with the 
<page:695>
was the late Mr. Ballance's policy. This Financial Statement bristles with comparisons between 1891 and 1901. I will take members back to the man who founded the Liberal party that has been triumphant during the last ten years, and will arraign the present Go- vernment before I am done by saying that they have departed from every one of the cardinal principles on which Mr. Ballance built up the Liberal party. Here are some quota- tions from the Budget speech of 1891. He says,- " If we are to maintain our credit and finan- cial independence, borrowing in the English market must cease ; while any local borrowing is likely to be confined to the absolute necessity of carrying on those essential works of coloniza- tion, such as the settlement of the people on the land, on which depend so directly the pro- sperity of the community." That is what local borrowing was to be con- fined to ; and again he says,- " On the other hand, if the machinery of Go- vernment could be simplified, and judicious retrenchment carried to its proper limit, the expenditure side of the account might still be considerably reduced. But we are strongly of opinion that any material reduction must come from a more direct and simple form of admin- istration, directed to the attainment of practical ends ; and it will be necessary to see that our measures of legislation do not include liabilities which will render this form of economy an impossibility." He further says,- "It is true our debt is great, and the popula- tion to bear the burden comparatively small. We have marched for twenty years at a furious pace, too severe to last, and have piled up obli- gations to make sane men pause." " I desire that it may be understood that the only safe policy for the colony is one of self- reliance-one which fosters colonial enterprise and creates a colonising spirit, which recognises that the capitalist equally with the labourer must be identified, by residence and fulfilling all the duties of a colonist, with the progress and destiny of New Zealand." In another part he went on to say that Parlia- ment should commence to " erect the structure of our financial independence." These, Sir, were the leading lines of the Ballance policy of 1891. Now I shall proceed to show how they have been departed from by the present party ; and now take, first of all, the growth of the national debt. Cn the 81st March, 1901, the net debt of the colony was #37,359,000 ; on the 31st March last it was £48,557,000, showing in round numbers an increase of £11,200,000 in ten years. This is surely, as Mr. Ballance said, "marching at a furious pace." Now, analysing the debt a little closer, I shall show how Mr. Ballance carried out his principles. The net debt on the 31st March, 1893-the year Mr. Ballance died-was £38,144,000, so that, after carrying out his policy of self-reliance for two years, Mr. Ballance increased the debt by or at the rate of £1,302,000 per annum. Sir J. G. WARD .- Does that £7,000,000 in- clude released sinking funds ? Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- I am taking the net figures of the Financial Statement as given by Mr. Ballance. I am quite prepared to admit that a large part of this vast increase of £1,302,000 per year that has been placed on the back of the country, is for interest-earn- ing objects, such as land for settlements, advances to settlers, and loans to local bodies ; but the fact remains that on a great part of it the colony has to pay interest, as I shall presently proceed to show. I now turn to the accounts for interest and sinking fund. This is stated in the Budget to be for the last year £1,745,615; but this statement is grossly mis- leading. In order to put the colony's finances in a false position, various charges on interest and sinking fund account are ignored. The British money-lenders need not be deceived with the idea that the colony is carrying a debt of £48,557,000 on interest and sinking- fund charges amounting to £1,819,000, as ap- pears in the estimated expenditure for the year :- Actual Payments for current year on Interest and Sinking Fund. As per estimates 1,819,000 On 3-per-cent. loans for Advances to Settlers and Land for Settle- ment Accounts 67,200 . Land for settlements 62,693 Advances to settlers 8,000 .. Accident insurance . 70 £1,956,963 The amount payable will be, as per estimates, £1,819,000. Then, in addition to that, there are recoveries on the 3-per-cent. stock, on page 5 of the estimates, from Advances to Settlers and Land for Settlements Account, £67,200. On the Land for Settlements Account a further sum of £62,693; from the Advances to Settlers Account, #8,000 ; and from the Accident Insur- ance, $70. So that the actual interest which will be payable by the people of this colony almost entirely to the British money-lender this year is $1,956,963. The Treasurer has invented a plan by which, instead of stating the gross amount of the debt on the one side and the accrued interest from the interest-earning de- partments on the other, he deducts the amounts receivable from the interest-earning departments from the gross amount of the interest payable, and thus places, as I say, a false and fictitious statement of the position before the country, being the net interest payable after deducting the amounts receivable from interest-earning departments. Without any hesitation, I say that the interest payable by this colony for the year ending on the 31st March, will be £1,956,963. And now I just pause for a moment to say it appears to me that very often but little reliance can be placed upon the statements as they emanate from the Treasury. In the 
<page:696>
under the heading of the Public Works Ac- count, there is stated an account of the sale of the $500,000 of 4-per-cent. debentures, London issue, and the #500,000 4-per-cent. debentures, colonial issue. Now, we knew of the colonial issue of $500,000 of 4-per-cents., which is dealt with in the Financial State- ment, but until that Gazette came out this week we were not informed that the Govern- ment had raised $500,000 at 4 per cent. in London during the last quarter. This is the first intimation given that, in addition to the colonial loan of $500,000, another $500,000 had been borrowed by the Government in London. But when I turn to the estimates of ex- penditure what do I find ? I find that whilst the Gazette of the 20th August states that the English colonial issue of that loan was at 4 per cent., the Government are actually taking authority to pay at 32 per cent. on both the London and colonial issue. Which is correct ? I ask the Treasurer, or whoever may deal with the speech I am making, what is the explana- tion ? Honourable members will see on the estimates, under the heading of " Aid to Public Works and Land Settlement Acts, 1896-1900," " Interest on $500,000 at 34 per cent., 1st Oc- Interest on tober (London issue), £8,750. $500,000 at 3} per cent., 1st October (colonial issue), $8,750." And yet, in the New Zealand Gasette published on the 20th August, a few days after the Financial Statement was de- livered, it is stated that the loan was obtained at 4 per cent. and not at 34 per cent. An Hon. MEMBER .- A printer's error. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL. - I do not know whether it was a printer's error or not. But there is another element that should be con- sidered in estimating our interest and sinking- fund charges as compared with ten years ago. In the year 1894, the then Colonial Treasurer, the Hon. Sir Joseph Ward, brought down a scheme in connection with the drawing loan, which very materially reduced the interest and sinking-fund charges. I am not going to weary honourable members with a statement of the very technical proceeding by which that was done. I will simply read to honourable mem- bers one short passage from the Budget of 1894, which explains my position. The Colonial Treasurer said,- " After careful consideration and considerable correspondence, I decided to do away with the charge for interest and sinking fund on bonds which had already been converted, and confine ourselves to making provision only for the bonds remaining in the hands of the public. After this year the charge for interest on the Consols will diminish in proportion as the debt becomes extinguished by the annual drawings ; under the former method it steadily increased year by The charge under this loan for year. . interest and sinking fund has been diminished by #182,957." If you want to make any comparisons of what was the position ten years ago as compared with that to-day, you will add $182,000 to the sum of $1,956,963, which is the interest this Mr. G. W. Russell by a stroke of the pen you will get what the position of the colony is to-day compared with what it was ten years ago. And what must be the effect of this huge increase of the debt ? The effect of it must be that there is a frightful increase of the taxation of the people of the colony. The Budget shows that the increase. so far as Customs revenue is concerned, is £653,655 as compared with 1891. I am going to reduce this to a matter of population, and honourable members will then see exactly what the position is. In 1891 the population of the colony was 626,368, and the Customs revenue was €1,527,207, or a net amount of $2 8s. 9d. per head. During the year just closed. with a population of 772,504, the Customs  revenue has risen to £2,180,862, or #2 16s. 5d. per head. That is to say, the Treasurer is drawing at the present time 7s. 8d. per head of Customs revenue from every man, woman, and child more than Mr. Ballance did in 1801 : and the result is that the revenue of the colony from Customs sources has increased to the extent of $296,126 more than the basis of \-- Mr. Ballance's revenue from Customs would produce. Let me give honourable members a sample case of what this means. If you take the paper H .- 9, " Consumption of Articles in Common Use," and take the case of a man and his wife with a family of five children, what will be the result ? The father would pay on spirits, €1 19s. 10d., and on tobacco, #1 12 -. 2d .: 1 the father and mother would pay on wine, -- 2s. 7d. ; on English ale, 1s. 4d. ; on New Zealand beer, 6s. 7d. ; and the whole family would pay on tea, 12s .; on coffee, 10d .; on sugar, ₺1 8s. 7d. ; and on ad valorem goods. £6 13s. 10d. In other words, that family of father, mother and five children-the children all being under fifteen years of age-would pay to the Customs revenue #12 17s. 9d. a year under the impost at present placed on families in this colony on those articles. The Govern- ment refer in terms of regret to the shrinkage of the birth-rate. I venture to say that were the Government wise in carrying out their duty, their object would be to lessen the bur- \- dens upon the necessaries of life, because, after all, in my opinion, the very large shrinkage of the birth rate, and the decline in the marriage rate, are economic questions rather thall social questions; and I believe, therefore, that the policy of the Liberal party in this colony should be by prudent administration, by re- trenchment and economy, to seek to lessen the burdens of the people, and specially to take the burdens off those things that are necessaries of life. I have shown that during the last ten vears the Customs revenue has increased £653,000, and upon the basis of Mr. Ballance's revenue in 1891, the taxation from Customs has gone up nearly $300,000 per year. I say that is not what was expected from the Liberal Go- vernment. In the utterances of Mr. Ballance from which I have goted, he spoke very strongiy of the necessity of this colony being weaned from servile dependence upon the London money-market. He said that borrowing in the 
<page:697>
reliance. Let us see now how far this has been carried out. During the year that has just expired the present Government raised in loan moneys ±1,749,000, made up thus :-- Loan - moneys raised during Financial Fear ended 31st March, 1901. For public works 900,000 .. 380,000 Advances to settlers .. Land for settlements 219,000 . . Loans to local bodies 176,000 .. Dairy industry 1,781 Accident insurance 2,000 .. Consols 17,900 .. · Sinking fund accretions 52,800 . . Total £1,749,481 . . And, Sir, nearly the whole of this money, excepting what has been taken out of the pockets of the people so far as the savings-bank deposits are concerned, has come from the English money-market; and at the present time this colony is absolutely dependent on the English money-market ; because, if circum- stances should happen so that New Zealand should, from any cause, or from various causes, be unable within the next six months to go on the English money-market and borrow large sums at less than 4 per cent., I tremble at what the position of this colony will be twelve months hence. Now, let us look at the public works expenditure, and how that is mounting up. The last year that the Atkinson Govern- ment were in power-that is, the year ending 31st March, 1891-$157,000 was spent in public works. John Ballance came into power in 1891 with a mandate from the colony, that he, by   the public works expenditure, was to stem the tide of emigration which was going from New Zealand, and by which we were fast losing our population ; and he did it. How did he do it? He did it with an expenditure during the year ending 31st March, 1892, of $389,000. That was the amount that Mr. Ballance spent on public works during the year when he was Colonial Treasurer, and ending the 31st March, 1892. Then we go on, and honourable members will be interested in seeing what followed : For the first three years after Mr. Ballance died the expenditure was kept within reasonable bounds. It was in 1893 £472,000, in 1894 $409,000, in 1895 $359,000. And now watch how it grows : In the next year, 1897, it was $411,000, next year £427,000, next year $864,000, next year $916,000, next year #964,000, and last year the colony spent on public works £1,307,000. Finally, the Treasurer comes down with his Financial Statement and says the public works estimates this year are £1,950,000. And yet, as I have shown honourable members, the Hon. John Ballance, having received a mandate from the country, came in and saved New Zealand, and turned the tide of prosperity back to our shores, instead of from them, on a public works expenditure of $389,000. Now, I say that during the current year the Seddon Go- during the year ending 31st March, 1892. I would ask honourable members : do they realise -does the country realise - what an awful state of things is involved in this colony carrying on at this present time as it is with borrowed money ? For what would be our position at the present time if suddenly circumstances were to compel us to stop this drain of borrowed money, and return to the simple forms of Government which were initiated by Mr. Ballance, and which he said were absolutely necessary to be carried out if the colony was to be weaned from a servile dependence of the London market ? The follow- ing shows the public works expenditure from 1889 up to the present :- £ 1889-90 214,000 427,000 ¿ 1896-97 .. 1890-91 1897-98 157,000 864,000 .. 1891-92 916,000 389,000 1898-99 .. 1892-93 472,000 1899-1900 .. 964,000 .. 1893-94 409,000 1900-1901 .. 1,307,000 . . 1901-1902\* 359,000 1894-95 1,950,000 .. 1895-96 411,000 \* Estimated. I cannot help thinking that the Budget now before the House is not only a record for length and verbosity, but that it is also a record for humbug. It says that there should be "a jealously guarded expenditure," and that "the national expenditure should be cut down to the lowest limit consistent with efficiency." In the year ending the 31st March, 1891, the annual appropriations for departmental expenditure were $2,014,000 ; on the 31st March, 1895-the Government had been prudent up to that time ; they had held their hands, and the expenditure had only risen consistent with the necessities of the colony's finance and the bare expenditure necessary for the development of the colony- in 1895 the departmental expenditure had in- creased up to £2,189,000. Then I take a jump from 1895 to 1899-1900. In that year our expenditure rose to £2,854,000; in the follow- ing year it rose to €3,144,000, and during the present year the Government propose an ex- penditure of £3,329,000. These are the annual appropriations, and do not include old-age pensions. This short table indicates the growth of the departmental expenditure :- 1890-91 .. 2,014,000 1899-1900 .. 2,854,000 1,998,000 1891-92 1900-1901 .. 3,144,000 2,018,000 1892-93 1893-94 1901-1902\* 3,329,000 2,147,000 .. 2,189,000 1894-95 ' Estimated. I say that down to 1894 and 1895 a reasonable brake had been kept on the expenditure, but since then the colony has gone a "mucker," and we are approaching without any doubt that period in our history when there must be a roar for retrenchment, and when the necessities of our position will be so forced upon us that the colony will be absolutely compelled, whether we like it or not, to go in for such drastic re- 
<page:698>
guarded expenditure," and they call it "reduc. ing the national expenditure to the lowest limit consistent with efficiency." But that is not the only fact : Let honourable members take up the estimates at the present time and they will see that the salary of nearly every high-salaried official is increased. An Hon. MEMBER .- Not that of the Auditor- General. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- The salary of the Auditor-General is not an annual appropria- tion; I am dealing with departmental expendi- ture under annual appropriation. Now, let me take Mr. John Ballance's year, because Mr. Ballance's second year of expenditure was less than it was in his first year. Take the year 1891-92 and compare it with the estimated ex- penditure for the year we are in at the present time. During the year 1891-92 the actual ex- penditure on the departments of the colony was £1,998,000. The estimated expenditure this year is £3,329,000, an increase in ten years of £1,331,000 in the expenditure on the ordi- nary departments of the Government of this colony. In his earlier days as Premier Mr. Seddon had those democratic ideas of sim- plicity which were worthy of him as he then was-a Liberal leader. But, unfortunately, he went to England, and got badly bitten with the military craze. Here is the proof of it: The Defence vote for 1895-96 was £68,000, but last year, excluding the cost of the South African contingents, it was £119,000, and this year it is estimated at £183,000, also excluding the  South African contingents - as compared with 1895-96, an increased military expenditure this year of £115,000, and this does not in. clude contingent defence. I am one of those who think that, while it is desirable we should have our shores defended, and that our population should be in a state of readi- ness to meet any emergency that may reason- ably be expected to arise; but I protest from my place in this House, as one of the represen- tatives of the people, against the tendency which is showing itself at every turn to create a military caste in this colony. Let any man take the estimates and see how, within the last year or two, the number of permanent military officers has been enormously increased ; and I ask, Is this necessary? I do not think it is. We should encourage our Volunteers, and con- fine the permanent establishment to that small reasonable number of departmental officers that may be necessary at headquarters and in the four centres ; and, if we do that, New Zealand will be prepared to meet any foe that might come along. But during the last few years there has been an unreasonable tendency on the part of the Government to raise the military pro- fession to an abnormal and undesirable status. We want to remember that our chief line of de- fence here is the British navy. I am prepared to vote any reasonable sum that may be neces- sary to increase the number of warships that surround our shores to keep an invader off ; I am prepared to vote for any reasonable Mr G. W. Russell date, and to enable them to have a reasonable amount of ammunition ready in case of emer- gency. But the very idea of turning numbers of our young men into persons strutting about our streets, wearing swords, and epaulets, and red jackets, fancying themselves a different class or caste in the community, is, to my mind, utterly abhorrent ; and I venture to hope the Government will pause before taking any further steps in the direction of making this country more-what shall I say ?- some- thing in the nature of a third-class military State of some European empire. We must recognise that we are colonists, and that the nearer the approach to the simplicity of colo- nial life the more thoroughly we shall be able to work out our destiny. Unless we put our foot, while the country is young, on the ten- dency towards the military spirit which is so sedulously cultivated at present, there will be a tendency in the course of forty or fifty years towards the country having something in the nature of a standing army; and who is there that does not recognise what a menace to the liberties of the people the existence of anything of that sort may be? I think members will agree with me when I say that, bearing in mind the manner in which the Government have increased the borrowing, have increased the public works expenditure, the military expendi- ture, the loan expenditure, and the departmental expenditure, I am not far wrong if I say that prudence has been cast to the winds, and the philosophy of the Budget may be summed up in the Epicurean phrase, "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die." Last year the House increased the salaries of Ministers, and increased their number, in order to enable them to trans- act to better advantage the work of the colony. Yet, I think, if we were to add on to the in- crease of salaries of Ministers and the increase in their number the cost of the Royal Commis- sions set up during the year, it would be recog. nised that a very enormous increase has taken place in administrative expenditure, for I hold that each of these Commissions has been merely doing work and making inquiries that could have been made, and ought to have been made, by a really capable Min stry. We have had, first of all, the Rivers Commis- sion, on which the member for Geraldine has been placed, and for which probably he has received certain emoluments. He has had his reward. We have had the Coal-mines Com- mission, and I venture to say that the work done by the Coal-mines Commission ought to have been done by the officers of the Mines Department, and that there was no need what- ever that a Commission should be appointed outside the Mines Department in order to deal with the facts obtained by that Commission. Now I come to the Commission on Federation. and what have we got for that #3,800 of ex- penditure? We provided some dozen or so of gentlemen with a trip through the Austra- lian Colonies-men who reported exactly as we knew they would report before they started.

and what has the colony got for that ? And, Sir, in connection with that Commission, what do we hear? We hear that the Government, outside of the Disqualification Act, have pledged themselves to increase the pay of members of that Commission over and above the money that is allowed by law; and when the ques- tion was asked a few weeks ago in the House the Premier did not deny it, and said it was intended to bring down an amendment of the Disqualification Act. Then, Sir, there was the question of teachers' salaries, and what did the Government do regarding that? "There was a matter of £8,000 voted by this House last session for teachers' salaries, and the Government kept that expenditure dang- ling in the air, and the Minister of Educa- tion was writing letters to every Education Board in the colony and putting them off, until at last, about the 5th April, when the finan- cial year had closed, the Premier stepped in and settled the whole question, and the money was started to be paid over. What is the posi- tion regarding that? I venture to say that it did not suit the Government to pay that $8,000 over during the financial year -- they wanted it to increase their surplus-and there- fore that expenditure was kept dangling before the eyes of the Education Board until a few days after the close of the financial year, and then it was paid. And what happened ? Why, another Commission was set up. The Government ap- pear to be so absolutely destitute of adminis-  trative initiative and capacity that they refer almost every question of importance to a Royal Commission, and so they set up a Royal Com- mission regarding teachers' salaries. I venture   to say that that Commission was set up largely in order that the member for Masterton might be appointed Chairman of it. Everybody in this House knows the restive attitude of that honourable member during last session. Every- body knows that when the Government brought down a Bill dealing with teachers' salaries it was he who called a caucus and led the attack, and went and warned the Government that their proposals would be thrown out. And then, shortly after the session is over, my honourable friend is appointed Chairman of the Commission, and look at the effect. There is no restiveness now ; he is as mild as milk-he has come to heel-and he provides his best style of attack on every man who chooses to open his mouth against the Ministry. The honourable gentleman has been whipped into line, and it has been done by a Royal Commission. Then, Sir, we have had another Commission, and on . that there was my honourable friend the mem- ber for Motueka, who is not here this evening. That I should describe as a Commission long .drawn out. I believe it took some five months to inquire into matters relating to the Midland Railway. Now, Sir, what is the position of that question ? Does any member of this House mean to tell me that New Zealand or England will be satisfied with the report of that Commission, which will cost probably a thou- ture-holders of the Midland Railway is such that I hardly like to characterize it in this House. I feel, as a New Zealand colonist, that the idea of a number of men spending, as we ourselves have shown, between £600,000 and £700,000 in making railways in New Zealand, and then bringing it in that they have no interest in that expenditure and that all their money has been swallowed up, is such that I feel ashamed of it. I venture to say, Sir, that though we may not suppose the London money-market, which is an exceedingly sensi- tive thing, would be likely to boycott our loans and do us an injury, I believe it will be better for this colony to do the righteous thing in connection with the Midland Railway, and to find out not from such a Commission as was set up, consisting of two Government supporters and two or three officials, but from men who have a large world-wide experience, and who are able to judge on such a matter, what the fair value is that New Zealand has got from the expenditure of those people, and do the honest thing. Sir, I am of opinion that the words of a book that some of us may have read more when we were younger than we do now, that "Righteousness exalteth a nation," are distinctly applicable in such a matter as this, and I feel as ashamed of this country taking over the Midland Railway and not paying a fair value for what it has taken over as I would be if I had had a house built and the unfortunate contractor had put him- self within the penal clauses of the contract, and I found myself sitting in a house for which I had not paid a sixpence. That is a fair state- ment of the position of the colony towards the Midland Railway debenture-holders, and I sub- mit that, whatever may be the sentiments of the Government, especially of the Right Hon. the Premier, public opinion in this country will rise to the occasion and compel the Go- vernment to bring down sooner or later some plan by which we can say with a clear con- science that we have not taken one sixpence from the debenture-holders of the Midland Railway for which they have not received full value. I do not say anything on behalf of the company, because the company went into the matter as a business speculation with their eyes wide open, and they lost. But I do say that the debenture - holders who went into the matter understood as business-men that the guarantee of this colony stood behind them, and it was only at a certain point in the history of that great undertaking that they discovered that they and their lawyers and everybody connected with them had been mistaken, and that the overriding power of the Crown in seizing the line wiped out their sup- posed security for their advances. I say that under those circumstances this country can afford to be honest ; and I believe the time will come when, whether this Government do it or not, the people of New Zealand will insist on an honest course being taken in connection with that great undertaking. Now, Sir, I would ask 
<page:700>
so far as we can see at the present time? The labour question dominates the finances of New Zealand. There is at the present time a stand- ing army of 5,627 men employed as labourers on the co-operative works carried on by the State in New Zealand. They are kept going on loan-money, and a large part of the money that is paid to them from the English lender filters back into our Treasury in the shape of Customs duties. Stop the loan - money, and the Seddonian finance would tumble to pieces like a house of cards. Mr. Ballance, as I have stated, turned the tide of adversity into prosperity by an expenditure of $389,000 a year. It apparently takes $1,950,000 a year under the Hon. Mr. Seddon to keep things going. Now, let us ask ourselves what would happen if, say, one-half of this army were turned loose. Wool is down : the revenue from that source will be two millions of money less this year than last year, and private expendi- ture will therefore be restricted by that amount. As I have already said, wool is down to the extent of $2,000,000 sterling, and the spending- power of the people will therefore be restricted this year to that extent ; and if our standing army of co-operative labourers were turned loose to look for work in the open market, or if our public works expenditure were reduced to even the amount that Mr. Ballance considered sufficient-$389,000 per year-there would be such an " unemployed " difficulty in New Zea- land as has never yet occurred. Sir J. G. WARD .- Would you like to see that? Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- No, I should not ; I should be pained to see anything like that brought about, and I will now tell the Govern- ment where they have blundered, and what they should have done to prevent such a catas- trophe. The Government have not expended sufficient money on settlement side by side with expenditure on public works. They have drawn the genii from the bottle, and he is there standing before them, and they cannot get him back. He is the co-operative labourer. I do not say that the time has passed when the Go- vernment could deal with this important ques- tion as statesmen, but they have not proved themselves to be statesmen. They have proved themselves to be opportunists; and year after year the expenditure is growing, and it keeps growing, on roadworks and railways, whereas their attention should have been directed to land-settlement. In this way numbers of men now engaged as co-operative labourers should and could have been absorbed. Vacancies would thus have been made in the labour-market, which would have been filled by men now engaged as co-operative labourers. One of the first planks of the policy of Mr. Ballance was that of settlement upon the land. What did the Government do under the Land for Settlements Act of last year ? Why, Sir, they put only 177 farmers on the land, according to their own showing in the Financial Statement. One hundred and seventy-seven is the total number of farms that were provided under the Land | don money- market, a policy of self-reliance. Mr. G. W. Russell men's homes, as they are not worth looking at from the point of view of land-settlement. In Canterbury and Otago, which I am best acquainted with, the total purchases by the Government last year under the Land for Settlements Act were only £53,000. In a previous speech this session I showed that the expenditure was $186,000, but if I give the Government credit for their purchases. not for what they paid for, the amount is $350,000. I would ask, Why have they Lot done more ? They have authority to buy up to $500,000 every year. The cash paid last year under the Land for Settlements Act was only £186,000 ; whereas, including the unexpended vote of the previous year, they had the right to spend $630,000. Can you wonder, Sir, that the number and influence of the co-operative labourers keeps on growing, and that we have our constituents urging us to get the Govern- ment to give them work rather than starve + I say, if the Government wish to return to the policy of Mr. Ballance, instead of, as the Premier is everlastingly doing, dancing abou: in and out of the colony-I say, Sir, instead of the Premier being the Minister in charge of the purchase of lands for settlement, that that department ought to be handed over to the ablest man in their ranks, who should "go the whole hog," so far as the legal powers are con- cerned, in the purchase of lands for settle- ment. An Hon. MEMBER .- Where ? Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- Everywhere. They ought to go on settling the lands in the North Island. I do not wish land-settlement only in the South. Do the Government mean to say that in Wanganui, Masterton, Wairarapa. and in other electorates, especially Hawke's Bay. there are not great tracts of country suitable for settlement as well as in Canterbury and Otago? What I complain of is that the Canter- bury people have been told all the time that the land-for-settlements policy is a quid pro quo as against public works expenditure in the North. Mr. SYMES .- Rubbish ! Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- I think the inter- jection of the honourable member for Egmont is excessively insolent and ill-timed. As I have already stated, the Government, by their own showing, spent during the year ended the 31st March last only £53,000 on land for settlements in Canterbury and Otago, and I say, there- fore, that his remark is improper. I 9.30. am quite prepared to meet the honour- able gentleman in fair argument, but when he interjects such a remark as " Rubbish " it simply shows that he does not know what he is talking about. You have rung the bell upon me, Sir, and I will only say, in conclusion, that there are other matters upon which I should like to have spoken before my time was up; but I have shown clearly that what we want is. first of all, to carry out the Liberal policy that has been laid down so far as land for settl- ments is concerned, independence of the Lon- 
<page:701>
our public expenditure. Honourable members may think I have spoken severely. Sir, I have said what is in my mind, and I have supported the position I have taken up by facts and figures. It is for those who hold a contrary opinion to quote facts which controvert the statements I have made. I believe the future of this colony is a great one, but it will only be great in so far as its future is one which combines progress on all important questions together with economy in administration, honesty in our Government, and that large- hearted brotherhood which, I believe, is the foundation of Liberalism everywhere through- out the world. Mr. ELL (Christchurch City) .- Sir, I have listened with a great deal of interest to the speech of the honourable member for Riccarton ; but, while listening to his remarks in respect to the growth of the departmental expenditure, I cannot help calling to mind the clamouring there was last session-although I resisted it and voted against it, and will always do so -- the clamouring on the part of a number of honour- able members in this House for raising the salaries of the different officers in the Govern- ment service. An Hon. MEMBER .- Name ! Mr. ELL .- There is no need to name them. It was said that Magistrates were not paid enough ; and that the Judges were not paid enough, and then there was the further com- plaint that sufficient was not being done to-  . wards marketing our produce that the farmers were raising in New Zealand. Under that . head there is an increased expenditure of £9,000. Then, there were complaints made #cc-zero by a number of honourable members with regard to the Tourist Department. Now that department has been set going, and there is an increase there of about $9,000. Then we established another department, which was very much needed, though I am very sorry to say it has not borne the fruit the majority of us have expected from it. I refer to the Public Health Department. Certainly it has not been in operation for more than twelve months, but still there is a halting on the part of the heads of that department. We were in hopes that it would have the effect of stimulating the local bodies to greater activity in improving the health of their districts ; but it has not come up to our expectations in that direction, though the set- ting-up of that department means an increase in the public expenditure of nearly $7,000. These votes can be defended, no doubt ; but, on the other hand, a very considerable bill is placed be- fore us this session for cablegrams. We cannot get at them. We simply see the huge sum, and we see a considerable increase over last year. I hope we shall have a little light shed upon this particular item in the public expenditure. Then, we have an item-and this is only typical of the ground of my complaint with regard to the de- partmental expenditure-of ₺260 for the Review of Reviews. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- I must call the honourable gentleman's attention to my ruling to in detail in this debate. Mr. ELL .- It seems to me that there was no need for that expenditure. We spend a lot of money every year in sending away hand-books setting forth the attractiveness of the colony, and there is no need for spending money as is proposed on the Review of Reviews ; while, on the other hand, when a man unfortunately meets with an accident on the railway and loses a limb, or loses his life and leaves a wife and perhaps five or six children, and when the Public Petitions Committee recommend a grant of £100, and that amount is cut down to £50 Sir J. G. WARD .- What case is that ? Mr. ELL .- There was the case of a man who lost an eye, and the Committee recommended a grant of £100, and that was cut down to £50. Sir J. G. WARD .- He was not killed. Mr. ELL .- No; but he lost an eye, and the statement was made that he was half a mile away from the line; but the man in this case was walking along the Hazledean Road, and near the railway-line, when a spark from the engine got into his eye, and it was taken out by a doctor, the doctor giving it as his opinion that that spark was the cause of the man losing his eyesight. The Committee recommended a grant of $100, and it was cut down to $50. Yet we have $260 proposed to be voted for the Review of Reviews, which was not needed, and which the Government were not warranted in authorising, and I shall be prepared to vote for striking that item off when it comes up in the estimates, as a protest against the spending of money in a direction which was not warranted. Then, with regard to the great increases in the public works expenditure-that expenditure has grown enormously, as has been pointed out by the member for Riccarton -- in 1893, during the present administration, £341,337, and for the current year, £1,950,000. And who has asked for the expenditure? All round this House, from year to year, there has never been enough money put down on the esti- mates to meet the demands of honourable members. It seems to me, with regard to the growth of public works expenditure, that the members of this House should take their full share of the responsibility. It is all very well to say that the Colonial Treasurer is abso- lutely responsible with regard to the increase of this expenditure; but I say that honourable members should accept their responsibility, seeing that they clamour for increased votes, and complain that the votes are not large enough. And I am only stating what are the actual facts. Then, there is another matter that I have to complain of, and that is the adminis- tration of the Lands Department. For years and years on end promises have been made on the platform by member after member, pretty well throughout the length and breadth of New Zealand, that the land-sales would be stopped, and still they are going on. Land has been sold in the immediate neighbourhood of the centres of population. Land is being sold right alongside the main trunk railway-lines, where 
<page:702>
State were to retain them it would then become possessed of the enhanced value, and the en- hanced value would go into the pockets of the people; but while they are being sold for cash the enhanced value goes into the pockets of the speculators who purchase them. In the neighbourhood of Napier the Minister authorised land to be put up to public auction, and the upset price was £160 per acre. At Mangaweka, on the Main Trunk line of rail- way and the main road through the North Island towards Auckland, he has authorised the putting-up of land there, and the upset price is fixed at £140 per acre. Now, we know how values have grown in the immediate neighbour- hood of the main trunk lines of railway and along our main roads. Now, instead of the State parting with these lands, they above all others should be retained by the State, and the enhanced value come into the pockets of the community ; but the State is parting with the lands for cash. But the Minister has not fol- lowed out that policy, and I venture to say that in that particular again he is departing from the principles laid down by the late Mr. Ballance. And it was the intention of the late Mr. Ballance to stay the sale of Crown lands for cash, and he emphasized that fact over and over again, and that is why his name has been so much revered and so highly spoken of by the Liberals throughout New Zealand. Then, with regard to the Public Works Fund, we have had transfers from the surplus revenue of two millions and a quarter of money. We  have had extracted from the pockets of the community through the Customs revenue, by taxing their food, by taxing necessary articles of clothing, by taxing necessary furnishings in the home-we have collected from that source far more revenue than we need have collected, and we have had so much out of that surplus that we have had two millions and a quarter of money to aid the Public Works Fund. That policy I have never approved of. I have always considered it to be absolutely wrong and unjust to the working-classes of this colony that they should be taxed, first on their food, and articles of clothing, and absolute necessaries in the shape of furnishings to their homes, and that that should be used towards the cost of con- structing the roads, bridges, and railways, which have, no doubt, considerably enhanced the land-values of the colony. I say that the interest upon these moneys which have been expended in constructing our railways and roads is, undoubtedly, a proper and just charge on the land-values of the colony. And in this connection we have been promised for a good many years past the application of the better- ment principle, in order that the State shall recoup itself to a certain extent for the expendi- ture on public works by the enhanced value of the lands which are benefited by the construc- tion of those works, and that that enhanced value should to a certain extent go into the pockets of the community. New South Wales . has had this principle in operation for some years, and we ought to have put it into opera- Mr. Ell says. An Hon. MEMBER .- It is too late now. Mr. ELL .- No, it is not too late. Land- values are still on the increase, and they are rising, and at an enormous rate. A remark made by the Hon. the Premier not very long ago was to the effect that, according to the latest returns, they had gone up another six millions. During the last few years land-values have gone up 20 per cent., and yet we get no more land-tax than we did when the land-tar was first put into operation. With regard to the complaint of the honourable member for Bruce that the vote for old-age pensions had in- creased so enormously, I do not regard that as matter for complaint at all. The country has benefited by it. The money that has been paid out to these old people has not only made their lives more pleasurable to them, but the country has benefited, because a great portion of it has come back to the pockets of the community by being spent amongst them. I do not think we are justified in saying that the system has broken down, or that it has failed to do good, because a few have made an ill use of what has been to the great majority a great source of comfort. We have been told on various occasions, and particularly by the Premier when he spoke at Amberley in the early part of 1900, that the Government had taken the duty off cotton goods, and to that extens had benefited the poor man. They have done nothing of the sort, because they are collecting more money out of the poor man now than at the time the tariff was altered. In 1896 the value of cotton piece-goods coming in free of duty-the commonest kind of cotton goods in use by the poor people-into the country amounted to £210,000, and in 1900 it still amounted to £210,000. The lesson is this : that they have come into the country in in- creased quantity, but, instead of coming in duty- free, they have come in charged with 10 or 20 per cent. duty. The effect of the alteration of the tariff has been that, instead of the people paying less on cotton goods, they are paying considerably more. If any honourable member will take the trouble to go into any of the ware- houses he will see there bales and bales of stuff that used to come in free now paying 10 or 20 per cent. duty. A great deal still requires to be done with regard to Customs taxa- tion, and I am entirely in accord with the honourable member for Riccarton that we are taking too much from this source. There is still 30 per cent. on sugar, 25 per cent. on raisins, 25 per cent. on sultanas, 60 per cent. on currants, 50 per cent. on figs, 100 per cent. on dates, 50 per cent. on preserved ginger, and from 10 to 20 per cent. a valorem on cotton piece - goods. Then, ceun- terpanes, which are a necessary furnishing for every decent working-man's home, are 20 per cent. ad valorem ; handkerchiefs 20 per cent .: oilcloths, which are the covering of a poor man's floor, for only rich men can go in for carpets. are charged 20 per cent. ; cutlery is charged 20 per cent., and numerous other items I can 
<page:703>
tured in the country successfully. This amounts almost entirely to a revenue tariff; it is cer- tainly not protective in any sense. And yet we are allowing the land-values of this country, which have gone up to such an enormous extent, to get off without paying a fair share of taxation. If members will turn to the amount of the land-tax in 1893 they will find it amounted to £297,181, and in 1901 it amounted to $294,583-£2,598 less than in 1893. That, Sir, is what we are getting out of the land-values, although they have gone up nearly 20 per cent. This is due, of course, in some measure at least, to the fact that estates have been subdivided. That is one reason. Another is that the Government, in the ad- vances to settlers, escape paying the mortgage- tax. Now, with regard to the dispute as to whether the Premier is responsible for the mild panic which spread over the colony, there is no doubt, if the newspaper report is correct, that he started it ; but that has been pretty well threshed out by the member for Hawke's Bay, the member for Bruce, and the member for Riccarton, and no good purpose is to be served in considering the point any further. I now wish to refer to a social question. The member for Auckland City a short time ago referred to the fact, in answer to some remarks I made, that drunkenness is not on the increase in New Zealand. It seems to me, while we are dealing with the economic side of the questions in this country, the Legislature and the Ministry have a duty with respect to the social life of the people. If members will turn to the Police Commissioner's report of last year they will read these remarks :- "The increase in the number of charges of drunkenness during the year has far exceeded that of any previous year, so far as the records show. The total during the year was 6,289, being 757 over the figures of 1898." Then, again, it goes on to say :- "This large increase in Auckland is, in my opinion, largely due to the increased efforts of the Auckland police, under Inspector Cullen, to more expeditiously remove drunken persons from the streets than was formerly the case, and to the fact that during the whole of 1899 the closing-time of licensed houses in Auckland was eleven o'clock p.m. instead of ten p.m." And yet in the face of this report that drunkenness was increased by increasing the hours of sale, the Premier has the audacity to suggest that the hour of closing for the whole colony shall be fixed at eleven o'clock. Mr. HANAN .- And reduce the penalties. Mr. ELL .- And reduce the penalty, as the honourable member for Invercargill states, in order to encourage drunkenness. There is no other term for it. Now, the Commissioner does not repeat his remarks respecting the effect of drunkenness in this year's report, but, however, they are applicable to this year, namely :- "Drunkenness is always reflected in the number of such offences as manslaughter, abusive and threatening language, breaches of decent exposure and behaviour, obscene and profane language, and obstructing and resisting the police. The net increase under the fore- going heads is 288." Now, here we have the opinion of the Com- missioner that some of the worst features of our criminal record, that some of the worst crimes that disgrace New Zealand, are at- tributable directly to drunkenness, and yet we have the Hon. the Premier suggesting to in- troduce legislation that will give further privileges to a trade which is working these terrible results upon a young country like this, and amongst the people of a young country like this. The Commissioner, in his report for the present year, states :- " During the year the number of charges of drunkenness was 7,299, being an increase of 1,010 on the figures of the preceding year. This increase far exceeds that of any previous year so far as the records show." Here we have again the report of the Com- missioner that drunkenness is still on the in- crease. Now, with regard to the drink bill of New Zealand, this bill has been prepared by Mr. C. M. Gray, one of the oldest Justices of the Peace, and one of the most respected citi- zens of Christchurch, and a man who has been Mayor on several occasions. Mr. Gray has pre- pared the drink bill for a number of years past. The drink bill for the 31st March last is as fol- lows :- Gallons. 555,772, at 40s., 1,111,544 Spirits Wines 116,703, at 40s., 233,406 .. Ales 52,617 175,390, at 6s., Colonial beer .. 6,773,520, at 4s., 1,354,704 7,621,385 £2,752,271 This gives an average for the year of £3 78. 6d. per head. Now, in 1896 it was $2 17s. 2d. ; in 1897, £3 1s. ; in 1898, £3 2s. 4d. ; in 1899, £3 3s. 1d .; in 1900, £3 5s. 10d. ; in 1901, £3 7s. 6d. : so this will show that the drink bill per head of the people is going up at an alarming rate. An Hon. MEMBER .- It is our prosperity. Mr. ELL .- Yes, Sir; but it has its effects, and, instead of granting facilities for the sale of drink, the lesson is this: that it is the duty of the Legislature and the duty of the Govern- ment to assist by every means in their power in checking the sale of liquor amongst the people, seeing it has such terrible results, as shown by the police reports. Mr. FISHER .- The reports published in the Appendices to the Journals last year show that the consumption has gone down. Mr. ELL .- The honourable member can speak after I have done. Sir, a kindred subject to the one that has been so fully dealt 10.30. with and so fully commented upon by honourable members is that of the enormous increase of our public debt, and the enormous increase of the interest charges upon that debt. One-third of the total amount of our revenue has now to be taken every year to pay interest to the foreign bondholder. It seems to me 
<page:704>
attention of members of the House. A question that involves so much expenditure and that necessitates the collecting of so much revenue is one that should certainly engage our serious attention, so that we may see if we cannot devise some means to check the further growth, and to do something in the direction of reducing the great public debt which now rests on the tax- payers of the colony. Mr. R. THOMPSON .- How will you do it ? Mr. ELL .- The member for Marsden wants to know how we are to reduce it. Well, the best way to reduce it is to endeavour to pay some of it off, and to check the further in- crease we should borrow less from the foreign bondholder. Then, Sir, there is a matter that has on various occasions in years past engaged the attention of the House-I refer to the question of the currency. Hon. MEMBERS .- Oh! Mr. ELL .- It is a matter that seems to excite some of the members of this House. Whenever any one mentions the currency it brings a smile on their faces, and directly any one mentions the word "currency " the ex- pression comes from the lips of members, "Oh, you only want a bale of paper and a printing-press." I have been charged by cer- tain honourable members, who have not taken the trouble to listen to what I have said but have simply jumped at conclusions, that I have been advocating the purchase by the State of a bale of paper and a printing- press, and rolling off notes for distribution  amongst the people. I have suggested nothing of the sort, but what I have suggested is that the State should adopt the same methods of creating credit as banks have adopted. Now, Sir, with regard to the State controlling the currency, I desire to say that, prior to the year 1666, the State had absolute control of the cur- rency, and issued all the currency to the people A clause was then inserted in one of the laws giving private people the power of taking their gold to the Mint for the purpose of having it minted, and from that date up to the present time the currency has practically been under the control of the banking institutions of the English-speaking world. Now, how have they used that power? It has been said that the State is not a proper authority to have absolute control of the currency, and that, if the State were to get this. terrible disas- ters would result. If honourable members will refer to " The History of Monetary Systems," by Alexander Delmar, who is regarded as one of the greatest authorities on currency and on banking, they will see in Appendix B a list of suspensions and failures of banks covering eight or nine pages of closely printed matter- of failures that have occurred since the esta- blishment of private coinage, and since private control of the currency was allowed. Now, we have instances on record, not only in the Old Country, where the State has frequently had to come to the assistance of banks to enable them to carry on their functions to prevent disasters taking place, but in Australia also Mr. El of the banks. We know the history of our own colouy in the case of the Bank of New Zealand ; and also the savings-bank at Auckland, which There is on record a reso- there was a run on. lution of the directors of that bank. Mr. MASSEY .- It was not the Post-Office Savings-Bank. Mr. ELL .- No; it was a private savings- bank ; and we find that the directors thanked the Government for coming to their assistance in helping to tide them over a difficult period. I am sorry that the honourable member for Wakatipu is not in his place, for he has stated that the banks cannot create credit. I am now about to quote from McLeod on " Banking." He is a recognised authority on the customs of bankers. On page 128 of the first volume he says,- " He reaps exactly the same profit by creating a credit in favour of his customer as if he gave him the actual cash,"-he is now referring to what a banker may do in his banking parlour, whether to a State, a Municipality, or a mer- chant-"and the cheques drawn against these credits so created by the banker circulate commodities exactly in the same manner as bank-notes do, which circulate commodities exactly in the same manner that gold and sliver money does. Consequently, these credits so created by the banker are currency or circu- lating medium. From this it manifestly fol- lows that banking credit is banking capital." We have the testimony from Delmar showing the injuries that have resulted from handing over the control of the currency to private bankers, and we have the authority of one of the greatest writers and authorities that the bankers can create credit, and that they do so. Now, what does McLeod say ? On page 136 he says, with regard to the benefits that have re- sulted from creating credit by bankers,- "Now, suppose a farmer is known to be active, skilful, and industrious, and obtains a farm upon lease, which is capable of great im- provement. He goes to the bank. and, upon the security of his lease and some friends. who become bound for him, the bank grants him a cash credit. With this advance-pure credit- he reclaims the land, employs the people, reaps the harvest, and, when that is gathered. pays back the loan. It was in this manner that that prodigious progress in agriculture was made in Scotland. There were immense quantities of reclaimable land and abundance of unemployed people, but no capital or money to set their industry in motion. Seeing this state of matters, the Edinburgh banks opened branches in numerous parts of the country, and sent down boxes full of one - pound notes, and granted cash credits to the farmers. The farmers made their purchases and paid wages with them ; and the enormous tracts of barren land were changed into fertile cornfields. Now, these one-pound notes were not a substitute for any specie : they did not supersede or displace any previously existing money ; they were a pure addition to the existing money ; and, see- ing all this, what are we to say of the doctrines 
<page:705>
of money can be of any use to a country, and that to issue paper in excess of specie is robbery ? " That is a distinct answer to the statement made by honourable members that it is dan- gerous to create credit without a certain pro- portion of specie at the back of it. If we limited the amount of our currency in this country to, say, 75 per cent. of notes to every 25 per cent. of gold, it would stop progress in every direc- tion. We do not carry on the business of this country by simply one-pound notes and the silver and gold we have got here. The progress of this country has been helped along by the credit created by bankers; it is by credit that we have practically constructed our public works and carry on nearly all the different institutions and industries in New Zealand. Now, to show that there is another real danger with regard to this control of the currency by the bankers, I will refer members to a speech made by the late Mr. Ballance. When in Supply on the 4th September, 1885, Mr. Bal- lance said, --- "There was a fear on the part of the banks that, in the case of a cruiser coming to one of these ports, there would be a run on the banks, and there was a threat made that, unless some- thing was done to protect the ports, a large portion of the bullion held against the note- issue would be sent over to Melbourne ; and no doubt that threat would have been carried out if the Government had not taken steps to have the ports fortified." There is a pretty position for the currency of the country to be in-the Premier stating that unless the country was prepared to thoroughly fortify the ports and spend money #cc-zero in that direction they would ruin the currency of the country by shipping the gold that was at the back of it out of New Zealand ; and that is the position we are in at this present day. It seems to me that it is a question that should engage our attention-that we should have our currency on a more secure footing than we have at present. The banks have no right to be in the position to threaten to ship the gold out of the country, or to do anything to dis- locate the currency, thereby injuring the whole country. Now, with respect to this question, I may say that a proposition was made by Mr. Verrall, a member of this House in 1890, in favour of the State assuming sole control of the currency, and on that division I find the names of Mr. Ballance, Mr. Duncan, and Mr. Hall- Jones as having voted for it. Mr. HALL-JONES .- What was that on ? Mr. ELL. -- There is no necessity for the honourable gentleman to think lightly of the vote which he gave on that occasion, because it was a vote which, I venture to say, goes in a very proper direction. In addition to that, in regard to the State assuming the whole control of the currency, we have the Hon. Mr. Ward stating in 1899 that, in his opinion, it was only right that the State should take control of the cur- rency and the issue of notes from the Treasury in Wellington, and we have the Premier also VOL. CXVII .- 44. we have Ricardo stating that he considered that the State should assume the sole responsibility of the issue of notes, and Mr. Gladstone has also given his opinion in the same direction, and a number of others whom I could mention. I do not ask that the State should not have gold be- hind the notes. They could have the gold, and carry on banking in the same way that bankers do. That could be done easily by the Govern- ment, and we should then have our currency on a far more secure footing than we have it now. We have in deposits, which are at call in the banks and the Post-Office Savings-Bank, a sum nearly equal to thirteen millions of money, and yet we have only two millions of gold in the country. Supposing there was a run, could these demands be met ? Obviously they could not be met. Yet it is said you must have gold behind the notes ; but the fact of the matter is this : that the currency of this country simply circulates on the confidence of the com- munity, and not really on the gold basis, and without confidence our currency could not hold out for a day. To give an illustration, as show- ing what has been done for the bankers in New 'Zealand at present, from 1895 to 1900 the Go- vernment have paid to the Bank of New Zealand interest to the amount of $206,785 on Treasury bills. They have simply created credit on the note of hand of the Colonial Treasurer, and they have charged the Government of New Zealand $206,785 for creating that credit. What 1 say is this : that if the Manager of the Bank of New Zealand, in his parlour, on simply a note of hand from the Colonial Treasurer, can create credit to this extent, and then charge the Go- vernment interest on that credit, then I say that the manager of a State bank could do the same and save the country that interest. There would be more security behind a State bank than behind the private banks. Then, we had the statement from the Minister in charge of the Advances to Settlers Department, and from the Premier, that the Bank of New Zea- land have advanced the Government $239.000 during the last financial vear, simply on their note of hand ; that is, the bank created this credit in favour of the Government, and the Government have simply operated on it by means of cheques in the ordinary way. Now, Sir, if honourable members are so very anxious to reduce the interest charges, then the best thing that they can do is to give the Govern- ment all the moral support they can to induce them to establish a State bank of issue, which will put our currency on a more secure footing, which will advance credits to the Government and credits to the local bodies. This is a work which is carried on by banks in other countries. The Bank of Scotland, which has a Roval charter, the Bank of England, which has a Roval charter, and the Bank of Ireland, which has a Royal charter, are all to a certain extent State banks, and they advance credits in favour of the British Government. In Sweden they have had for many years a State bank, but that belongs absolutely to the State. The directors are elected for three years. It is a bank of de- 
<page:706>
the note-issue is on a gold basis. In Belgium there is a bank of issue, which has been in existence since 1850. It is a State bank for public and private business, and the paper there is issued on a gold basis. In Austro- Hungary, the issue there is under Stare control, and the State shares in the profits of the bank. The notes are issued there on a gold basis. In Norway they have two State banks, and they also issue on a gold basis. I might enumerate a number of other countries in which the State has a direct control over the currency with regard to the issue of notes and shares in the pro:its which the bank makes out of the com- mimity. And in this connection, in addition to showing the great advantages and the great profits which arise out of banking, and seeing that the Government policy has been to establish State fire insurance, so that the charges for fire insurance might be reduced to the community, it seems to me that a monopoly of this character should not have the control of our currency, and be able to create loans in favour of the Govern- ment ; and that means the earning of an enormous amount of money, and I hold that it is a mono- poly that the Government of New Zealand should tackle. I firmly believe, if a vote were taken of the electors of New Zealand, there would be an overwhelming majority in favour of the State having the right to issue the notes, and in favour of the State establishing a State bank. At the time of the declaring of a dividend for the April quarter the banks had in reserve profits nearly three millions and a quarter, and the amount of the dividend for the four banks  32106019788246 -of course, the Bank of New Zealand did not pay a dividend amounted to $242,500. This will give an idea as to the very profitable character of this business. Now, Sir, with    regard to the way the banks act with regard to the currency, if honourable members will take a bank-note from their pockets -- I am sure there are still some in this Chamber-on examination they will find on some of them " We promise to pay on demand here." That is dated Auckland. On others they will see " We promise to pay here . Wellington " ; and on others we find " We promise to pay," without any locality being named. That latter note can be cashed any- where. But suppose a man at the Bluff had ten Bank of New Zealand notes, or notes of any other bank, and they were dated from Auckland, and he goes to the bank and wants those notes cashed. If the bankers are in any difficulties with regard to gold in that particular bank, or if the bank is in any straits with re- gard to redeeming its notes, it may absolutely refuse to cash any one of those notes. That is the position our currency is in, and I say this House has no right to leave the currency in that position -- that private trading institutions can, if they do not conduct their businesses in a careful way, depreciate the currency of this country. And they can do it as things are at present. If notes are dated from Auckland i down (Mr. Ell). I believe the honouralle and are presented at the Bluff, what right have we to give the bank the power of saying, " You must take those notes or post them to Auck- 'terests of the country in which he lives. We Mr. Ell I say we have no right whatever ; and, Sir, I make no apology for pressing my opinion on this question under the notice of this honourable House, and I make no apology to honourable members who have twitted me with having State bank on the brain. It is a question that will have to be faced by this House in the near future, and, if the House rises to the interest of the trading community, it must take steps in the immediate future to have a stronger grip of the currency of the country ; and, in addition to t' at, it must take power to create credit in favour of itself, and that can be done by a State bank. It was done by the Belgian Government. When the Belgian Government started the construction of their railways it had only a small surplus in band. But they had a State bank. There is no neces- sity for flooding the country with paper money. You want to adopt the same practice as the banks themselves. The Belgian bank simply created credit in favour of the Belgian Govern- ment, and the Belgian Government operated on that credit in the same way that the Advances to Settlers Department operated on the $230.0 \*) credit that the Bank of New Zealand created in favour of that department ; and all that I am asking is that the State shall establish a State bank under proper safeguards, which w uld then be able to create credit in the same way and just as readily as the Bank of New Zealand created credit in favour of the Government. To give you an idea that our currency 11.0. is not all it should be now, I went to the Bank of New Zealand to cash my cheque last month. I asked for eighteen sovereigns and two in silver, and I was refused it over the counter. And the late Hon. Mr. Bathgate gives another case, in which he presented a pound- note to a bank, and they said they could not cash it. If it is only in isolated cases like this it would not disturb the position of the country. but if a number took place a panic might arise. As I have shown, we have thirteen millions at call in the Post Office Savings-Bank and the pri- vate banks, and only two millions of gold in the country, and if a panic were to start it might bring about a disastrous result, unless the Government assumed the responsibility and de- clared the notes of the banks legal tender. I do hope that this matter will receive very careful and serious attention of the members of this House in the very near future. So far as I am concerned. I do not intend to leave the matter alone, and I am prepared to co-operate with members to bring about what I consider a very desirable change in the condition of our cur- rency, and our method of creating credit to carry on public works and other institutions in New Zealand. Mr. LAWRY (Parnell) .- I do not suppose i there is any member of the House who does not ; realise the earnestness and honesty of purpose ! of the honourable member who has just eat gentleman is fired with patriotism. I believe he desires earnestly to advance the best in-

represented a district in Canterbury has fallen upon the honourable gentleman. I refer to Mr. Verrall, who, in season and out of season, advo- cated a State bank in this colony. But it will be a very long time before the country realises, if ever it does, that there is a necessity for a paper currency in New Zealand. I understood the honourable gentleman was going to move an amendment in favour of establishing a State bank. Why did he not have the courage of his opinions in that respect ? Mr. ELL .- I gave notice that I would move it, but I did not have time to do so. Mr. LAWRY .- Then, it was the honourable gentleman's misfortune, and not his fault. did not intend to speak to-night until I heard the speech of the honourable member for Ric- carton, a speech more full of fallacies than any I have ever heard in this House. The honourable gentleman does not understand even the kindergarten system of politics in this country. He has no knowledge of the Customs duties in this colony. Does he not realise this great fact that the Customs duties in the colony are in the main voluntary ? He said that the Customs duty per head had been rising gradu- ally. Does the honourable member not know that the Customs duties of this country could not be increased in volume unless the people had the spending-power to enable them to ex- pend their money on dutiable goods which they purchase? The honourable gentleman said that the Customs duties of this colony was so much per head of the population. There never was a greater fallacy uttered in this House or in any Parliament of the British dominions, because I know for a fact there are people who give great banquets in this country, and who pay more money in one night in the matter of Customs duties than the honourable gentleman pays in the whole twelve months. Take myself, Sir ; I smoke cigarettes. Is there . anything on the face of the earth to compel me to pay duty on the cigarettes that I may buy? It was seldom that I ever agreed with our Chief Justice, Sir Robert Stout, when he was in this House, but in reference to this particular question he pointed out to the House and the country that the country settler need scarcely pay any Customs duty at ail. He said here on one occasion that he could grow his own sheep, and eat his own mutton ; he could hive his own bees, and eat his own honey ; he could grow his own pigs. and eat his own bacon ; he could rear his own hens, and eat eggs produced on his farm. Sir, the honourable gentleman's lecture to mem- bers of this House, from start to finish, was in the worst taste I ever heard, and I hope never to hear again anything in comparison with his speech on the floor of this House. What position does the honourable gentleman occupy in this House? He only represents one man -- a majority of one, and yet the honourable gentleman presumes to rise in this House and lecture men who knew all about politics in this country when the honourable gentlemen was in a somewhat different and the present time. I would like the honourable gentleman to tell me who trusts him in this House. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- You do. Mr. LAWRY. - Do I? I believe, Sir, that if an immense pressure was brought to bear on the honourable gentleman by this House and by the country, that under that intense pressure the honourable gentleman could be induced to occupy a seat on these Ministerial benches. But there never will be any pressure. Sir, we have heard to-night the greatest "flapdoodle" I have ever heard uttered in this House. Does not the honourable gentleman know that the financial position of a country is correctly I gauged by. the amount of money that is paid in to its banking account, and the amount of money expended through the Go- vernment bank ? During the whole course of the honourable gentleman's speech he wanted to make the House first, and the country afterwards, believe that we were expending millions of money every year, and that we had nothing to represent that expendi- ture. Did not the honourable gentleman know, when he spoke about the number of men em- ployed on the co-operative works, that they were getting so much per day-that every man is virtually a contractor ; and would the honour- able gentleman insult these men by saying they are not earning the wages they are paid by the State ? Does the honourable gentleman not know that every man employed on the co- operative works is creating an asset for the State commensurate with the wages that the State pays him ? Will the honourable gentle- man deny that ? Sir, it appears to me it does not matter how much money we borrow and expend if we have an asset to represent the ex- penditure. I would like the honourable mem- ber to understand this: if we expend it judi- ciously we provide an asset to represent it. The honourable gentleman referred to the fact that only a small amount of money has been ex- pended on land for settlements in Otago and Canterbury. Why is that so ? Because of the honourable gentleman's opposition. What did the honourable gentleman do the other night ? When we had a fight to give the Government power to obtain money to secure land for settle- ment in Otago and Canterbury, the honourable gentleman denounced the whole proposal, and when the division-bell rang, where was he? He was like Moses when the candle went out -- he was in the dark entirely, hidden away in some obscure corner ; yet the honourable gentleman stands up in this House and presumes to lec- ture the Government for not having spent sufficient money in Canterbury and Otago to secure land for settlements. Does the honour- able gentleman admit that? The honourable gentleman will admit nothing that does not emanate from himself; and what emanates from himself is not worth a moment's con- sideration. Then we come to the quasi-leader of the Opposition, the member for Bruce. The member for Riccarton said the speech of the i honourable member for Bruce would be con- 
<page:708>
what intelligent elector in the country would take any notice of the speech of the member for Bruce. I remember well when we brought down the first proposal in this House to bor- row money to advance to settlers, the honour- able member for Bruce said the country would be involved in debt, and that the settlers would never be able to pay the interest. Sir, he de- nounced the scheme from the base to the apex : but what has been the result ? The result has been a triumph of a policy that is worthy of any Government on the face of God's earth. Then, Sir, we remember that when we were fighting for the abolition of that iniquitous tax - the most iniquitous ever exacted on the face of the earth -the property-tax, the member for Bruce, who is the acting De Wet of the Parliament, leading a disbanded party in a guerrilla political warfare, stood up on the floor of the House and said-or his party said so, which amounts to the same thing-that interest on money would rise, that none but the highest class of securities would be accepted, that agricultural industries would languish, and, in effect. that the country would rush headlong to financial destruction. Who will trust the utterance or the opinions of an as- pirant to Ministerial honours whose predictions have been so completely falsified by practical results ? Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- To what party did you belong then ? Mr. LAWRY .- I belonged to the party of progress and the party of liberty, as I do now, and I am now going to make my last protest against such interjections and insinuations as  the honourable member for Riccarton is in the habit of making. I hope that he will have sufli- cient intelligence to understand the courtesies associated with this House as they obtained when I first entered it, and the position honour- able members occupied in this House. When I was first returned I was opposed by the whole force and strength of the Atkinson Govern- ment, and the whole force and strength of the Bank of New Zealand ; and if the honourable member knows anything at all about the matter he would know that what I am now stating is an absolute fact. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- You were returned as a Conservative. Mr. LAWRY. - Well, Sir, I do not see much use of presence of mind when the honourable member for Riccarton can make a statement like that, which is not based on the highest principles of truth. When I was first returned I was opposed by the whole strength of the Atkinson party of Auckland, as exemplified by the fact that Mr. W. F. Buckland was my opponent, and he was one of the strongest sup- perters the Atkinson Government ever had. My policy was that I would support that party which was prepared to bring down a measure abolishing the property-tax, and substituting in its place a tax on land and income. When I came here, what did I find ? I appealed to the greatest statesman that New Zealand has ever seen. Sir George Grey. He said to me, " Lawry, we have an element on the Opposition Mr. Lawry have on the Opposition side three or four squatters, and if the Opposition were to bring in a measure to abolish the property-tax and substitute in lieu thereof a tax ou land and income, we would have those squatters against us, and we would not be able to carry our measures "; and he added, " The best thing we can do in the meantime is to support the Administration formed by Major Atkinson." I am not quoting the honourable member for Riccarton, but I am quoting the words of a statesman. Sir, if the late Mr. Ballance had taken my advice upon that occasion he would have turned the Atkinson Government out of power; and, instead of being in office in 1891, he would have been ir office in 1887. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL. - The Stout- Vog .: 1 Government were in office then. Mr. LAWRY. - In 1887 the Stout-Vogel Government were defeated at the polls, and the Atkinson Government came into power, and because I could not get what I wanted from the Opposition, except on the lines indicated. I had no alternative but to support the adminis- tration of the Atkinson Government ; but from the very start I told Sir Harry Atkinson that if ever a motion was brought down with the purpose of abolishing the property-tax I would leave the party which I had conditionally joined, and I would support any Administra- tion that would do what I believed to be in the best interests of the country. At that time Mr. Ballance could not do what he desired. for the reasons that I have already given. Now, Sir, dealing with the honourable member for Riccarton in the way I have referred to. the honourable gentleman is using a stedet- hammer to kill a mosquito. The honourable gentleman has fluency of speech ; he has the ability to clothe very small thoughts m suitable words. What effect have they upon the country ? We know what the honouraide gentleman has done in the past. We know that when he was in Parliament on a previous occasion the honourable gentleman made a political track such as an unskilful ploughman would make upon a piece of fallow with his plough, or an amateur on a bicycle. He wab- bled from one side to the other, and the result was, when the election came the honouraide gentleman was relegated to private life, a po-i- tion, judging by his speech to-day. to which the honourable gentleman should be r. le- gated at the next general election, and meri- toriously remain there as long as he lives. Take the speech of the honourable member for Bruce to-night ; take the speech of the honourable member for Riccarton. If New Zealand, or if the Old Country, attached any importance to the speeches made by those two honouratie gentlemen, what would the effect be? The effect would be to drag upon New Zealand a calamity which every loval subject would feel it his duty to do his very best to avert. What would be the effect if a fisherman, who went down to the wharf for the purpose of mak- ing his living, caught a bundle of fish, and 
<page:709>
these fish for sale, but these fish are stinking"? Every person he met would believe that he was telling the truth, and that the fish were abso- lutely stinking. Does the honourable gentle- man want to destroy the credit of this country ? If he does, and if this country and the financial institutions of the world believed what the honourable gentleman stated, the effect must be to destroy our national credit. But, for- tunately for the country, fortunately for our credit, and unfortunately for the honourable gentleman's reputation, there is not a man in the House or the country, old or new, that will attach the slightest importance to the honour- able gentleman's utterances. It makes one sick when we realise that an honourable member who has been 'returned here by one vote should stand up and criticize a Govern- ment under whose influence, and under whose influence alone, he could have entered this Chamber. I think it is rather unfortunate, Sir, that I never make any preparation before I speak. If I had prepared a speech I would or could have applied the political lash to the honourable gentleman I have referred to. Sir. we have had before this House during the present session a number of petitions relative to the question of licensing the sale of alcoholic liquor in the King-country. I should like to place this matter fairly before the House and the country. It has been stated very frequently that at the time when the first sod of the rail- way was turned there was a stipulation made between the Natives and the then Premier, Sir Robert Stout, that alcoholic liquor was to be prohibited, and should not be introduced into the King-country. I was present on that occa- sion, and I declare that no such stipulation was ever made publicly. I represented at that time one of the leading journals of the colony. It was my duty to faithfully report everything that transpired at that time. I say that Sir Robert Stout, the present Chief Justice. in making a statement of that nature has misled the public; because, if the arrangement was made, it was a private matter between himself and the leading chiefs of the King-country, or I was misled. I have the honour and the privi- lege of being well acquainted with the whole of the Native chiefs of the King-country, and I know very well that just after the first sod of that railway was turned a petition was sent throughout the King-country, and it was signed by nearly all the leading chiefs, asking the Go- vernment to take steps by enact ment to prohibit the sale of alcoholic liquor in the King-country. But what do the Prohibitionists forget ? They forget that there was a much more important matter attached to that petition : it was, that there should be no sale of land in the King- country. That was the principal request in that petition. The Prohibitionists have railed against the Government because they have not brought in section 33 of the Alcoholic Liquors Sale Control Act in that district, forgetting that that section could not possibly apply to the King-country. That section can only apply to a district where there are a lot of political teemed friend the honourable member for the Clutha, where a vote has been taken. I think any district that would by a majority of votes carry prohibition ought to be disfranchised. Of course, that is merely a personal opinion. The Prohibitionists have declaimed against the Government, because, as they allege, they have not enforced the Act which was obtained surreptitiously; but, I ask, has any Prohibitionist ever stood by the principle con- tained in that petition-namely, the non-selling of land in that district? I would like to point out that last year a Committee sat for seven or eight days, and took evidence on the question as to whether the prayer of the peti- tion for the sale of liquor in the King-country should be given effect to. I would like to point out to the member for Mataura, who is one of the most fair-minded men in this House, who was once a Prohibitionist, but who has seen the error of his ways, and who now believes in the liberty of the subject-I would ask him what did the petitioners ask for? Did they not ask that the people of the King-country should have the same power and privilege as the people possess in the District of Clutha? What do we find ? We find that one of the strongest Prohibitionists in Auckland, Mr. T. B. Hill, declared (as re- ported in a Taranaki paper) at a picnic at Raglan that he regretted exceedingly the action he had taken in going round and ob- taining signatures to stop the legitimate sale of alcoholic liquor in the King-country. And what do we find further in con- 11.30. nection with this matter ? I am very sorry that the Chairman of the A to L Public Petitions Committee is not in his place, for after these petitions were referred to our Com- mittee on my own suggestion, the Chairman of the Public Petitions Committee moved a resolu- tion that we should invite the Rev. Mr. Isitt to give evidence before that Committee, and that he should have the power to summon any wit- ness that he required. The Rev. Mr. Isitt forgot to mention before that Committee the admirable and eloquent speech made in the House upon the question by one man who knows more about it than Mr. Isitt will ever know, if he lives to be as old as Methuselah. 1 refer to the honourable member for Napier (Mr. A. L. D. Fraser). We gave the Rev. Mr. He brought Isitt not latitude, but license. down his witness from the Waikato-the one I refer to is Mr. W. J. Ellis, a Justice of the Peace in the King-country. Mr. Ellis gave his evidence, and then at the end of his evidence Mr. Isitt followed, and, speaking on the ques- tion, said that he had information that there was, in consequence of the sale of alcoholic liquor in the King-country. sly-grog selling, and there were few virtuous women in the whole country. He had forgotten that Mr. Ellis had married a half-caste lady, born in the King-country, and who was an honour to her sex; and I shall never forget, so long as I live, the denunciation poured on Mr. Isitt's head by the very witness he had brought down to support his own case. Then, Sir, the Rev. 
<page:710>
Mr. Isitt, who I believe by his misrepresenta- tions disgraces the cloth he wears-and I will tell him so if I meet him-delivered an address at Taranaki. He said, in effect, that he could not expect to get fair-play from the Committee, because there was only one Prohibitionist upon it-namely, Mr. Thomson, the member for the Clutha. Sir, I could have got the reverend gentleman before the bar of this House for a breach of privilege. We sent the reverend gentleman down a report of his evidence for correction ; but the reverend gentleman altered every single one of the questions of my cross- examination of him to fit in with his replies. I need not say anything more about this ques- tion excepting that Wahanui, the great Maori chief, told me that he had made a huge mistake when he approached the Stout-Vogel Govern- ment and asked them to keep licensed houses out of the King.country. I saw the greater chief Rewi just before he died, and he told me the same thing. I saw just before I came down here one of the most intelligent men asso- ciated with the Maori race - Mr. Arthur Ormsby. He told me he hawked a petition all around the King-country with a view of getting signatures for prohibition. He said, "I have since gone round and interviewed the whole of the Natives, and what the Natives really want at the present time, and what the Europeans in the King- country want, is to be enabled by vote, as they did at Clutha, to decide whether they should have licensed houses in the King-country or not." I think we all know that a great American has recently been through New Zea- land, a gentleman who contested with Mr. Mckinley the position of President of the great democracy of America. I mean Mr. Woolley. Mr. TANNER .- Nothing of the kind. Mr. LAWRY. - Who did he contest it against ? Mr. TANNER .- He never was fairly in the contest. Mr. LAWRY .- Then, I have less respect for his friends than I had before, for they said he did. But, Sir, a lot of fanatics in Auckland gave this gentleman a breakfast. At that breakfast he is reported in the New Zealand Heraid -- which never makes a mistake, one of the greatest journals of the world, a journal that abused me and others into Parliament, a journal that helped to put those honourable gentlemen on the Government benches with a stronger support than can be claimed by any other Government in the British dominions -- this journal said that Mr. Woolley stated at that breakfast that he was proud to know-1 am speaking from memory -- that there was an affinity between the two great races in this country. the aboriginals and the European settlers, and that he was very proud to know or realise that he had come to New Zealand many years after the time the Maoris had baked missionary for breakfast. I hope, before this gentleman leaves the colony, he will correct that statement and say he knew nothing whatever about it. My honourable friend the member for Napier will bear me out when I Mr. Lawry say that if there were any earnest people in New Zealand that the Maoris respected it was the missionary. At a time when it was scarcely safe for Europeans to go about in any part of New Zealand the old Maoris respected those people who came here at great sacrifice to teach them the Gospel and Christianity. I say the Maoris never killed a missionary for the pur. pose of using him in a cannibalistic sense. The honourable member for Napier, and the Native Minister, if he were here, would tell the House that the only two missionaries the Maoris ever killed were the Rev. Mr. Volkner and the Rev. Mr. Whiteley. And why did they kill them ? Because they were infatuated with fanaticism, and believed they had to do so to please some deity in whom they believed. It is a very wrong thing for a gentleman like that to come to New Zealand and make a statement of that nature ; and it is to be hoped the gentleman will apologize before he leaves our shores. I cannot help expressing the strongest dissent from the statement made by the principal De Wet of this Parliament. I refer to the honourable member for Hawke's Bay. He is doing here what De Wet is doing in South Africa -- he leads a guerrilla warfare. He said there never was a period in the history of the colony when farm-produce was so lou ss at present. Surely he knows nothing wiat- ever about the condition of the country. The condition of the country at present is that. although there is a decrease in the price of wool, there is a corresponding increase in the price of the carcase. I was speaking, when in Auckland, to a gentleman who holds a seat in the other place. I said the decrease in the price of wool must make considerable difference to his income. He said that what he lost in the price of wool he obtained in the increased price of the carcase of the sheep, and also on the We have been told that the Giw- lambs. vernment ought to have increased the facilities to bring people out to take up land. We have heard it stated on the floor of the House that the Government ought to increase the facili for settlement by outsiders. Personally, bio not believe anything of the kind. As I think I stated at one time, we ought to keep New Zel  land for New-Zealanders. I should like honour- able gentlemen to reflect for one moment that we have in our country thousands of childtel. --- children who are brought up to understand milking cows, feeding cattle, herding shop. and driving horses. If we unduly induce pe ple to come to this country to take up the limited area of first-class land we now possess. w.a. will the inevitable result be ? We shall place these children, when they become men and  women, in a worse position than my honouracle friend Mr. MeNab's father and I myself were in when we came to this country. Sir. I believe in the settlement of the country, but I believe in the gradual settlement of the country by the sons and daughters of the " sod." I believe that the settler of New Zealand is the backbone and mainstay of the country, and I would like to say at this particular stage that I am sure the Government of the present time, by bringing

and which the whole country resents, are not intentionally, but are, in effect, bringing these settlers into conflict with labour. I believe that labour has as much right to be represented in this House as capital, but I believe, Sir, that by bringing in Bills such as we have had lately the inevitable result will be to bring country members into conflict with the city representa- tives in this House representing labour, and the result will be detrimental to labour itself. In departing from this subject I would like to have seen the honourable member for Waite- mata and the honourable member for Franklin in their places. I would like to point out and emphasize what the honourable member for Napier said the other night. I must not refer to a previous debate, but I understood that on a certain occasion the honourable member for Napier severely castigated the honourable member for Waitemata for the slur and for the scurrilous innuendoes, not supported by facts, that he threw across the floor of a certain place I must not mention. The honourable member talked about bribery. The first time, Sir, that I stood for any electorate in New Zealand I stood against a supporter of the Atkinson Go- vernment. It was realised all along the line that I was going to win. In fact I had the election won four days before the day of the poll, but on the day of the poll I did not win, and that was the most important time. Would the honourable member for Mataura like me to tell him the facts? I will do so. Sir, it was  understood in the Franklin South electorate that I had the election won ; and I had won it if it had not been for bribery and corruption. The people in Waiuku had been agitating for a   railway from Pukekohe to their settlement. A survey of the line had been made, and the people on the eve of the election were promised that the line should be made without delay ; and they said, " We cannot support Lawry, because END OF ONE HUNDRED-AND-SEVENTEENTH VOLUME. By Authority : JOHN MACKAY, Government Printer, Wellington. vernment that will make this line for us." An Hon. MEMBER .- Shameful. Mr. LAWRY .- Yes, it was shameful. And up to the present time there is nothing to repre- sent the railway excepting the holes perforated by the flag-poles. Yet the member for Waite- mata says that I and other honourable mem- bers sold ourselves to support a certain measure on the strength of receiving #40. Sir, I would like to take this occasion to corroborate what has already been said on the floor of the House, that during last session I attended every caucus of our party, and I have no hesitation in saying -and my statement will be better received than the honourable gentleman's affidavit -- that the question of giving members $40 to support a certain measure never cropped up at any caucus meeting. The member for Mataura - whose word would be taken against that of the mem- ber for Waitemata or against that of any other member of the House -- says, "Hear, hear." The honourable gentleman, in that "Hear, hear," expresses the very highest principles of immutable truth. Sir, look at the Opposition benches now. It was said by an old fox- hunting clergyman, in the West of England on one occasion, when some of his parish- ioners found fault with him because on the Sunday morning he was preaching he sent his horse away to be fresh for him for a fox- hunt on the following day-he said to them, " Listen to what I preach: I want you to follow the light, not the lantern." Where are the political lanterns to-night ? where is the light? If there is any light at the present time it is burning with a ghastly, cadaverous hue. There is no source of replenishment, and very speedily it will burn out through sheer lack of combustibles. Debate adjourned. . The House adjourned at five minutes to twelve o'clock p.m.
