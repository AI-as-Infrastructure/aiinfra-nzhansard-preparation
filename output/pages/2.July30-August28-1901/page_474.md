REVENUES RECEIVED, 1891 TO 1900-1901. It will be interesting, and remove misgiving, if in simple form the revenues received through the principal revenue-producing departments of the State during the year 1891 and the year 1901 are placed before members. The following table gives the actual receipts for each year respec- tively :- 1890-91. £ Customs 1,527,207 .. 631,191 Stamps 357,348 Property-tax . .

The latest census of the people proved that during the last five years our population had been, relatively to the pre- vious five years-that is, from 1891 to 1896- actually decreased in number by 7,366 per- sons. The opinion of the late Hon. John Bal- lance, as expressed in his Budget in 1891, may not be out of place, showing as it does the bear- ing an increased or decreased population has upon the prosperity of the colony. Mr. Bal- lance said,- http://www.hathitrust.org/access use#cc-zero "I consider it my duty to direct the attention of the Committee to the lesson conveyed by the census returns of the population recently issued. Briefly, the rough results of the census, as shown by enumerators, give a population, subject to revision, of 623,352 persons, not including Maoris, against 578,482 persons in March, 1886, making an increase for the five years of 44,870. But the natural increase for this period, being the excess of births over deaths, is 64,168 persons ; so that the loss by excess of departures over arrivals is 19,298. "The arrivals recorded in the five years were 73,386, and the departures 83,948, giving a loss of 10,562 persons. It would thus appear that the unrecorded departures amounted to 8,736 persons.

"Now, here is a loss of wealth and wealth- producing power, in the departure of so many people from our shores to seek employment in other colonies, which demands the serious con- sideration of Parliament."
