utter contempt and inefficiency if they do not defend their privileges. He said,- " Could it be expected that they would stand high in the estimation and reverence of the people if, whenever they were insulted, they were obliged to await the comparatively slow proceedings of the ordinary Courts of law for their redress? They certainly must have the power of self-vindication in their hands ; and if there be any authority in the recorded pre- cedents of Parliament, any force in the recogni- tion of the Legislature, and in the decision of the Courts of law, they have such a power." I do not say in this case that any very great harm has been done, nor do I for an instant blame the reporter who furnished the report. On the contrary, I think it was a very clever and smart thing for him to do. He had nothing to do with the publishing of it. The whole of the responsibility for the publishing of the evi- dence must rest upon the management, and it is simply the publication of the report that our Standing Orders deal with and endeavour to prevent. I do not think it necessary at this stage to say anything further, than that I be- lieve it is the duty of the Government to at once take steps to have the publisher brought before the bar of the House. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) .- The Minister for Railways has told the House that there were two courses, either of which might be followed. I am afraid he has been led astray. There is one question, and there is only one course pos- sible which can be followed. Where he has https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.32106019788246 been led astray is in this : The case of 1874, which was quoted, was a case in which a Com- mittee of Privilege was set up to inquire into a question of privilege, before the House had decided whether a breach of privilege had been committed. But what is the position to-day ? The House has declared this to be a breach of privilege, because it is as clear as daylight that, a newspaper-that is to say, some person out- side the Committee-having published evidence taken by the Committee before the Committee had reported to the House, a breach of privilege has been committed. Now, I ask, What is the next course that ought to be pursued ? The course is clear, both by the rulings of previous Speakers and by what has occurred before in this House. If honourable members like to turn to the "Rulings of the Speakers," on page 158 they will find, in the case of a newspaper article, "If a member calls atten- tion to it it is read by the Clerk." That was done. Then, " A motion should be made that it is a breach of the privileges of the House." That also was done, and it was carried. Now, what is the next course to pursue ? "The per- son responsible for the article is summoned to the bar of the House to give an explanation ; after the explanation the House determines what course should be pursued." There are two rulings by Mr. Speaker Munro, one in 1867 and the other in 1868, dealing with this parti- cular matter. I have them both here, but I Mr. Barclay and the Speaker's ruling was that the person responsible is to be called before the bar of the House for his explanation. And it would be a gross injustice to the man who was accused of a breach of privilege if he were not immediately called before the bar of the House for his ex- planation. He might have some explanation that would be satisfactory to the House. In that case the House would proceed no further. He might admit the breach of privilege and apologize, as was the case in 1874, and the House might be satisfied with the apology. If the House is not satisfied, it may determine on a fine, or some other means of punishment. It is as clear as it can be that a breach 5.0. of privilege has been committed ; and we have declared that a breach of privilege has been committed ; and now we ought to ask the person responsible to make an explanation, and to make an apology if he has an apology to make. We are going in the wrong direction in proposing to set up a Committee when we have already declared that a breach of privilege has been committed. I think that the honourable member who is temporarily in charge of the House has taken a wrong course -- a course which is not according to precedent, and a course which very likely will be unjust to the publisher of the newspaper. It may be that somebody else is to blame ; it may be that some- body else has disclosed the evidence. When we have the publisher before the bar of the House -as we ought to have-we can ask him for an explanation, and ask him who disclosed this evidence. An Hon. MEMBER .- He will not tell. Mr. J. ALLEN .- If he does not tell us he will have to suffer the consequences ; but it is obvious that it is right that we should ask how he came by this evidence, and if we find that there is another culprit in the course of the examination we have a right to punish him as well. We have one culprit now, and that is the publisher of this evidence, and that culprit ought to be punished. The House has declared this to be a breach of privilege, and the House <!-- PageHeader="1" --> would be stultifying its own action if it does not go further, and ask the publisher of the newspaper to come before the bar of the House. and then, having heard his explanation, it will be for the House to decide what shall be done. 1 It is quite clear that the Minister is absolutely astray in this matter. The course now being pursued is not according to precedent, and is a wrong interpretation of what took place in 1874. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City). - Suppose the culprit does not defy the House. Support he appears at the Bar in obedience to the order 1 of the House and makes a full and ampie apology ; and suppose, also, that he did what a captain-I forget his name-did in England when he was adjudged guilty of a breach of privilege by the House of Commons. He ap- peared at the bar of the House and made LD ample apology. It was the custom then is
