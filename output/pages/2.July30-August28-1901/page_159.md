the boys would be far better on a training-ship ; for when a boy comes off a training-chip we all know that among British people a sailor is wel- comed everywhere -- every one is favourable to the sailor boy. Therefore I think it would be a great deal better that we should be without these land institutions, and have a training-ship in- stead. I intend most cordially to support the motion, and I am very pleased with the honour- able gentleman's persistence year after year ; and I do not regret the time that has been devoted to this discussion in the Council, because it has attracted and must attract attention in the country. The Hon. Mr. TWOMEY .- Sir, if the Order Paper were bigger I should not have taken up the time of the Council, as I do not profess to have any special knowledge on this subject, but there is one point that has been raised on which I wish to express an opinion. This point was raised by the Hon. Mr. Montgomery. I can understand the honourable gentleman's desire to maintain the high reputation of the British sailor ; he has. I understand, occupied a dis- tinguished position in the mercantile marine himself at one time, and consequently may be : pardoned if he has a partiality for that pro- fession. But J. think, like the Hon. Mr. Reeves, he is taking a very narrow view of it, and I was astonished to find that the British navy would not allow into the service any boy who had any taint of criminality. I do not know, ' when we look back at the British sailor, that ! he is of such an extraordinarily exemplary character that we need be so timid about the admission of a person who may be guilty of a very innocent and harmless trick in his early youth. 1 do not think he would suffer by that. { cording to the statement of the Hon. Colonel There is a great difference between people: there are two classes of people-people who are found out, and people who are not. These children may be in their early age guilty of a little in- discretion which their after conduct might well atone for, and I do not see that they should be ! branded for ever because they happened to do some little thing of a criminal character, pro- bably very innocently. That is the point I wished to speak on. While I do not think I would go altogether so far as the Hon. Mr. Feldwick, I do not think these ships should be shut altogether to persons who have been guilty of indiscretions. I, of course, have no know- ledge on this subiect. but I realise that a good work would be done by training these boys to a means of earning a livelihood. I think, too, that the assertion that the necessity for these training-ships is traceable to our legislation is a rather extravagant statement. I think it is altogether contrary to fact. I have a distinct recollection of a time previous to the introduc- tion of this legislation, and if such a statement had been made then, having regard to the con- dition of the workers at that time, it might be Â· said that something of the kind was necessary to provide for the unemployed in those days. At the time every street-corner was constituted a meeting-place for the unemployed. Our destitution from end to end of the land. Now the position has changed, and you might travel for miles, and days, without meeting a swagger. You would not iind one, and you do not hear of an " unemployed" meeting. Every- body has plenty of employment -- in fact, it is difficult to find workers; and that is the change that has come about contemporaneously with the currency of those laws which the honour- able gentleman deprecated, and which he said resulted in a training-ship becoming a neces- sity. I do not think that the honourable gentleman could support that statement by any system of reasoning, and I do not think it is capable of being substantiated by a single fact. What I state is the absolute truth as it is pre- sented to us now by our social conditions, and I think the honourable gentleman made a mis- take in making the statement, which anybody can see is at variance with facts. The Hon. Mr. FELDWICK. -- I would like to say, as a matter of personal explanation, that I did not state that children of criminal taint should not be admitted to a training- ship, but that we should have only the one object in view, irrespective of training boys for the Royal navy-that of training them to a sea life. The Hon. Mr. GOURLEY .- I have a mis- understanding on this question. If the motion is to establish a training-ship such as has been described by the Hon. Mr. Jennings-namely, the "Sobraon," which is moored in Sydney Harbour -- then I am opposed to it, because I consider that that ship is nothing more nor less than what the Minister of Education said vesterday-a floating prison. Then, ac- Pitt, these boys are taught the goose - step, 1 to know how to stand at ease, to touch their hats to their officers, to wheel to their right and left, and otherwise to do what they : are told ; but they have no freedom of action. The only good thing I see about that ship is that she has a schoolmaster on board, and that is the only good thing about it. Just imagine for one minute a vessel moored in Sydney Har- bour, which is one of the prettiest harbours in the world, and those children are cooped up on board that vessel, and can only look at their beautiful surroundings, while they know that other children of their own age are allowed some freedom of action for at least two or three hours in the day for the ordinary recreation which youth requires. Does anybody tell me that such a ship is the place for young children ? I say, No; and I say again that the industrial school on land is far better than a floating prison. If you want to establish a training- ship pure and simple I am with you -- that is, if it is to be a ship to train boys for the sea, as I understood from the Minister of Education yesterday that that was his idea. That is all right, and by all means have a training-ship, and provide that no boy on board shall be under fourteen years of age, and keep him there until he is sixteen, by which time. if he gets &
