Act "? Of course, at present a mortgage that is executed at all is, ipso facto, executed under either the Deeds Registration Act or the Land Transfer Act ; but, seemingly, the meaning of the words "executed under this Act " must mean "executed in the form contained in the First Schedule of this Act." Well, assuming that a mortgage were so executed, I ask, Is it a desirable thing, the Land Transfer system being simplicity itself, to introduce a hybrid system? Is it desirable to establish, in the interests of public policy, such a system ? I have spoken of the Legislature as being during recent years the great benefactor of the legal profession in the colony ; but there is no doubt, in passing the Land Transfer Act, the Legislature benented the .community at large enormously at the expense of the legal profession : The profits which the profession drew from the complications of the old system were greatly reduced by the very simple procedure and the security of title given by the Land Transfer system. One of the induce- ments which at the present time induce a wise owner of land to bring it under the Land Trans- fer Act is the lessened cost of dealing with land under the Act. If this Bill is going to have any effect at all it will be to reduce the cost of mort- gages outside the Land Transfer Act, not to make the costs under the two systems equal ; and this distinction calls attention to another fallacy in the argument of the promoter of the Bill, for the mere cost of preparing the deed is-I will not say a small part-but it is by no means the whole of the costs in con- nection with the preparation of the mortgage ; the investigation of the title outside the Land Transfer Act is often a very long, and therefore costly, business. But, speaking generally, the -cost of preparation of the deeds under the old system is considerably more than under the new. Now, if this Bill passes it will equalise the cost under the two systems so far as the mere preparation of the deeds is concerned. Is that desirable in the interests of public policy ? I submit it is not. It is in the interests of the community that all land should as fast as pos- sible be brought under the provisions of the Land Transfer Act, and, if that is so, you will by passing this Bill be taking a retrograde step ; we shall be removing one of the inducements at present existing to have land brought under the Land Transfer Act. Instead of tending to make one system you will have created an extra one, and have given the more ancient one a greater chance of prominence than it appears to enjoy at present. I have here the Land Transfer Amendment Bill introduced by Sir Patrick Buckley in 1892, and members who turn to clauses 14 and 15 of that Bill will find that they provide practically for the compulsory bringing under the Land Transfer Act of all transactions subsequent to the Bill becoming law : - " And whereas it is expedient that all lands within the Colony of New Zealand shall as speedily as possible be brought under the operation of the principal Act, and that, until land can be fully brought under the provisions with regard to dealings with such land and the evidence of title thereto shall be assimilated as nearly as possible to that prescribed by the said Act, but without guarantee of title : Be it there- fore further enacted as follows :- "Except as hereinafter mentioned, no instru- ment executed after the coming into operation of this Act for the purpose of creating, trans. ferring, encumbering, or otherwise dealing with any estate in land shall be registered under 'The Deeds Registration Act, 1868,' if the person or any one of the persons executing such instrument for the purpose aforesaid was at the date of such execution entitled to main- tain in his own name or in his own right an application to have the land brought under the operation of this Act." The very first conveyance of land executed after the passing of this Bill, if it had passed, would have given the purchaser a sort of pro- visional certificate of title under the Land Transfer Act, which in course of time would have matured into a certificate of title in the ordinary form. I will read a few words from Sir Patrick Buckley's speech in the Council in introducing the Bill,- " With regard to the second portion of the Bill, it was explained in the last portion of clause 14 that it was expedient that all lands in the colony should as speedily as possible be brought under the operation of the Land Transfer Act. It was proposed that when the Act came into operation there should be no further registration except under the provisions of the Act. Any person who had a title to land might adopt the simple mode prescribed in the Bill of going to the Registrar, and if the Registrar was satisfied that he had a title he would give him a provisional certificate. After the lapse of a certain time -- twelve years -he might then obtain a certificate of title granted under the Land Transfer Act." Though this may have been considered by the Council at that time too drastic, I would submit to the Minister that it is not in the interests of public policy that any inducement that at present exists to have the operation of the Land Transfer Act widened-to have more land brought under that system-should be re- moved ; and if this Bill is to have any effect at all it will be to lessen to a considerable extent one of the main inducements. I should like the Minister to explain whether the Govern- ment have considered this aspect of the ques- tion. Having considered the Bill a good deal last session, and this session again, this appears to me to be far the most important question of public policy touched by the Bill. In regard to the Schedule itself, no doubt the covenants set out in it approach much more nearly to those ordinarily in use than the covenants im- plied by the Property Law Act or the Land Transfer Act ; and in that respect perhaps the Bill may be considered to effect an improve- ment. But I would suggest that if the Go- vernment are satisfied that the covenants implied by virtue of the Land Transfer Act are now so out of date as to be obsolete,
