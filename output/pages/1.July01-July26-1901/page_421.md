An Hon. MEMBER .- Who is the authority ? Major STEWARD. - I will give it to the honourable gentleman presently. Another writer says,- " It needs but a little study of comparative politics to convince any one free from prejudice that the two-party system, whether in the English form or the more aggravated form of the United States, becomes, the nearer a perfect democracy is approached, more and more in- compatible with careful legislation, with honest and capable administration, and with the real freedom of the people." And of the evils of party government as it exists in the United States, Bryce, in his " American Commonwealth," says, -- " The tremendous force of party organiza- enslaves local officials, it in- tion . creases the tendency to regard members of Congress as mere delegates, it keeps men of independent character out of local and national politics, it puts bad men into place, it perverts the wishes of the people, it has in some places set up a tyranny in the name of democracy." Tyranny is indeed of the very essence of the https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.32106019788238 system, inasmuch as the leaders of party often do not hesitate to use the whole force of their organization to compel the acceptance or re- jection of propositions which may not involve any cardinal principle, and have not necessarily any connection with the matter of confidence or want of confidence in the personnel of the Administration. And that, Sir, notwithstand- ing the dictum of Lord Macaulay, who says that "No question should be made a Minis- terial one unless it is absolutely necessary for the Government as an executive body to carry out the administration of the country." " Parliament," says Sir Robert Stout, "ought to be a place where members could freely ex- press their opinions, and not be clogged with the feeling that if they speak or vote in a cer- tain direction it will injure the Ministry in power." And it is with a view to achieving that very desirable result that the present measure is introduced. It is the outcome of investigations into the workings of the present system that have been carried out by Committees of this House. The whole subject was exhaustively gone into in the years 1891 and 1894, and, shortly, these were the findings of these Com- mittees: The Committee of 1891 reported to the effect that- " Many and very serious evils are inseparably connected with, and spring from, the system of party government here; that it is unsuited have been felt, varying only in degree." The Committee of 1894 expressed the opinion that -- "Party government as it exists in New Zealand is not adapted to obtain the best results in government, and that a change is requisite." Sir, since that date I have had the honour on several occasions to submit a Bill to this House aiming at bringing about an effective reform. Though that Bill has not yet reached the statute-book. I believe it is solely because the House, not having been elected on the special issue, has not truly reflected public opinion in regard to it-indeed, I am convinced that if the proposed reform be remitted to the people under the referendum clause which it is proposed to insert in the Bill in Committee it will be adopted by a large majority. Since this measure was first introduced it has been extensively discussed in the columns of the public Press. Writing on the subject the Otago Daily Times says :- "Two of the most salient evils of the party system are the autocracy of the Premier and the forcing of members' consciences, a state of matters which is largely owing to the fact that the Premier selects his own Ministers, and possesses the sole power of bringing about the retirement of the Administration. The in- dependence of subordinate Ministers, as well as of members of the House, is thus fettered by a tyranny which is essentially undemocratic. The conscience of the country is gra- . Â· dually awakening to a sense of the evils and in- conveniences which attach to the present party system of goverment, and though the bond of traditional customs is not loosened in a day, right reason will eventually triumph." Another journal says .- " As to the grave evils of the party system, and the desirability of doing something to remedy them, there can be no two opinions amongst thoughtful and unbiassed men." Another writer says, -- " Under the elective Executive system would there be no gain to the country ? Is it a small thing even that an incapable or dishonest Minister could then be sent about his business without upsetting the whole Government ? Is it a small thing that Ministers could then be chosen for their ability and fitness for their posts, instead of being appointed for purely party reasons? I do not say that the fittest man in the House for each portfolio would always be so chosen, but that desirable end would at least be possible. At present this is not the case. The Premier has the sole ap- pointment ; he is limited in his choice to his own side of the House, and he has to reward those men who have, as it is called, ' claims on their party."" And another writer says : - " An elective Executive would tend to poli- tical purity, more sincerity, and speedier des- patch of business." And yet another,- " Were it not for the pernicious influence of party government, stonewalling would not be
