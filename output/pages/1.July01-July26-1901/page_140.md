than he could have made had it gone to arbi- tration. He said, - "I deemed it best to close the dispute by allowing them 2d. per stone, because the matter would otherwise have had to go to arbitration, and I believe that, as is usual in such cases, the arbitrator would have assessed the damage at a figure between those in dispute." He ought to have insisted on having an arbi- trator appointed-as I had already told him such had to be done in event of a dispute-in order that the question should be properly and definitely settled. Now, Sir, it happened another assessment was made of the same lot. This was a second assessment by another in- surance company who had an interest in the parcel. It is necessary, I suppose, to read all this because I wish it to go into Hansard, and, although reading out figures involves loss of valuable time, it is the only way to get it into Hansard. The table will show clearly the great discrepancy between the two assess- ments :- " Delphic," 15th September, 1898. Second Assessment. -- ExA- Sound. Damaged. mined.

And here are whole lines where the first assessor, Mr. Ismay, awarded all the sheep as damaged, whereas the second assessor, who had gone over the same parcel before the same buyer and claimant, found a large quantity of them to be sound. As an instance,- 274-75 Lambs. Second Assessor. Examined by Mr. Ismay. Sound. Damaged. Exd. Exd. Sound. , Damaged. Per stone. Per stone. 3 at 4d.

Award. 671 at 2d. per -tone. 406 at 3d. per stone. 30 at 4d. 310 at 3d. 406 at 4d. . 20 at 6d. - 1,407 436 So that out of a parcel of about 3,000 sheep, of which Mr. Ismay examined 199, he awarded damage on 1,407, the value of damage ranging up to 6d. per stone, whereas the second assessor of the 3,000 examined 265, and awarded only 436 damaged, the highest allowance being 4d. per stone. A careful study of the two assess- ments shows that Mr. Ismay, when he said that only 7 out of the 50 were damaged, when 27 were claimed, was very near what the second assessor arrived at-namely, he examined 110 of the 1,104 lot, and found 91 sound and 19 damaged ; thus 19 out of 110 is very close to " out of 50. Mr. Ismay has threatened to take an action for malicious slander against me for having referred to his work in connection with this large award. I may say that in the report that appeared in the papers of my statement it was made to appear that I had reflected upon him by implying that he had been bribed. That report was not correct. I said, "I do not say the man was bribed "; but in the report which appeared in the papers it went on to say, "I did not know whether the man was bribed or not." I say emphatically I do not believe Mr. Ismay was bribed, or could be bribed, nor that the buyer would use such means. What I do think was this : He was afraid that unless he gave a big award to the claimant, he would not get further employment. The whole sys. tem is infamous. Some of the buyers, if they do not get the assessors to approximate the amounts they claim, frequently object to having these assessors, and as these men are paid by the and not by a fixed salary, it is to their interest. of course, to get as many assessments as possible. I say if he thinks fit to take action against me
