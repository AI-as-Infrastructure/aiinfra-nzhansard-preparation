a large number of cemeteries where the trustees were appointed by the Superintendent under a provincial Ordinance. Will this Bill in any way affect these cemeteries or the Cemetery Boards ? I quite agree with the principle of the Bill. Road Boards and local authorities are fitter trustees for a cemetery than individuals, who die or disappear, or who may neglect their duties. The Hon. Mr. W. C. WALKER .- The Bill is not one dealing with old cemeteries which were provided for by Ordinance ; they, no doubt, have been validated, and there is no necessity to vali- date them again. The difficulty now is that Road Boards are not local authorities under sec- tion 2 of the Cemeteries Act. It is to rectify this that the Bill is necessary. If I find there is any necessity to make the Bill go further and cover more ground in the same direction I shall be prepared to meet it. Bill read the second time.

Bir. this measure I am now moving the second reading of is rendered necessary owing to the fact that the Presbyterian Church of Otago and Southland has decided almost unanimously to join hands with the Presbyterian Church of New Zealand. In connection with the property held by the Presbyterian Church of Otago and Southland legislation was years ago passed, and one of the terms of the union between the two Churches is that this property shall remain under the trusts which hold it at the present time. That being so, it is absolutely necessary that the Synod, or the governing body of the Otago and Southland Presbyterian Church, should be continued, not- withstanding the union, for the purpose of carrying out the trusts under which these lands are now held. This Bill is to give effect to that provision. I move its second reading. Mr. J. ALLEN (Bruce) .-- I wish to ask the mover of the second reading of this Bill one question. I think he has in his remarks deal with the subject I am about to refer to, but I hope he will make it clear in his reply. What I refer to are the particular trusts in Otago and Southland. At the present time these trusts are held, amongst other things, for higher educa- tional purposes. A portion of the money deriv. able from the endowments is being used for services in the Otago University, and three prof - sorial chairs are being kept up out of it. I believe the honourable member in moving the second reading made it clear that these trusts would remain absolutely unimpaired. I hope that that is so, and that he will give the House an assur- ance to that effect. If it is so, I have no d og tt that there will not be any objection to the Bill going through. I have nothing further tosas, (- cepting that it would be a very serious matter for the people of Otago if they were deprived of that assistance from these endowments. It would result in considerable harm to if not the break- ing-up of the Otago University. I agree with the principles of the Bill, but I would like the
