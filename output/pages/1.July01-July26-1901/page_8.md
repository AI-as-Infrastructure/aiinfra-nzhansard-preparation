beloved and revered by her subjects, and her memory will ever be enshrined in their hearts, and well may it be fervently said that " Her grave was watered by a nation's tears." Messages of sincere sympathy and condolence were forwarded by me to His Gracious Majesty the King and the Royal Family, to which the following reply was received from the Secretary of State for the Colonies: " His Majesty the King and the Royal Family command me to express their sincere gratitude, in which His Majesty's Government join, for the sympathy of New Zealand in the lamented death of Her Majesty Queen Victoria." On the death of his beloved mother the late good Queen Victoria, His Majesty assumed the Throne as King Edward VII., and the people of this colony most loyally acclaimed the reign of the new King, and his assumption of the Throne was with fitting ceremony proclaimed at the threshold of our Parliament Buildings. In al- most every city, borough, and county through- out the colony similar functions took place, and the people with one voice exclaimed, " Long live the King !" The most pleasurable event since the found- ing of the colony was the recent visit of their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.32106019788238 Cornwall and York, and the enthusiastic and loyal reception given them by the people of this colony will, I feel assured, ever be remembered with pleasure. The addresses presented came spontaneously from a free and devoted people, and breathed loyalty to His Majesty, his Throne, and Royal person. The enthusiastic welcome and receptions given to their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York were, in all parts of the colony visited, heart- felt, sincere, and universal. The demonstration by the people of the Native race at Rotorua was magnificent, unique, and historical, and it is questionable if ever again there will be another such gathering of the noble Maori race. The following passages taken from His Royal Highness's farewell message, in a letter con- veyed to me on the eve of their Royal High- nesses' departure, places on record the pleasure experienced and impression formed during their visit : - " Dunedin, 27th June, 1901. "DEAR LORD RANFURLY, -On the eve of our departure I am anxious to tell the people of New Zealand how happy we have been in their beautiful land, with what regrets we leave it, and what lasting feelings of gratitude we carry away for the loyal enthusiasm, cordiality, and kind-heartedness so universally accorded to us throughout our stay. " I was especially glad to meet face to face the Maori people, to have witnessed their vast and interesting gathering at Rotorua, and to have had personal friendly intercourse with their leading chiefs and representatives. It was gratifying to hear their assurances of loyalty to the King, their expressions of sorrow for their deeply loved Queen, and to experience their enthusiasm and warmness of heart to- wards ourselves. I am glad to think that this ancient and chivalrous race is living in peace <!-- PageHeader=":" --> and prosperity, and sharing with their Pakeha brothers the duties and responsibilities of good citizenship. i "Though, unfortunately, our stay has, from force of circumstances, been a short one, 1 earnestly trust that the experience and know- <!-- PageHeader="\--" --> ledge of the country which I have gained, and my personal intercourse with its people, may in some measure tend to sustain and enhance the existing feeling of sympathy and interest be- 1 tween the Mother-country and New Zealand, and thus draw still closer those ties of affection : and brotherhood by which we are so happily 1 united. "Heartily wishing that the steady growth and prosperity of the country may ever con- tinue, believe me, dear Lord Ranfurly, very <!-- PageHeader=":" --> sincerely yours, " GEORGE." <!-- PageHeader="\-" --> With the dawn of the new century the birth \-- -- of the Commonwealth of Australia was cele- <!-- PageHeader="!" --> brated : New Zealand was officially represented by the Right Honourable the Premier and the 1 Honourable the Native Minister. The Com- monwealth Parliament was opened by His Royal Highness the Duke of Cornwall and \-- York on the 9th May, and was a most im- posing ceremony : the Honourable the Colonial Secretary and the Honourable the Minister of Education officially represented this colony. It will be pleasing to all well-wishers of the colony and the inhabitants of the Cook and other Islands to know that by letters patent, dated the 13th day of May, 1901, His Majesty has approved of the extension of the boundaries of the colony so as to include the islands men- tioned in the resolutions passed last session by 1 both branches of the Legislature, and by Pro- clamation issued by me and read in the presence of their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York on their arrival at Auck- land. The boundaries have been so extended as from the 11th day of June, 1901. As you are aware, Representative Troops of the Imperial and Indian Armies were present at the inaugural Australian Commonwealth celebrations, and subsequently arrived in our colony : and it was with sincere pleasure 1
