The Customs returns for last month, £227,169, and beer duty #7,305, are the recent ones for the colony, and show the average for the five months to be the large sum of £185,513. That is a sum already ahead of what we have estimated for each month of the financial year. So I do not think any one can for a moment accuse us of discounting the future. Those are the absolute figures, and they can be checked by any body who likes to do so. I may also point out that on the 15th September last year the new tariff http://www.hathitrust.org/access\_use#cc-zero came into force. Under that tariff large con- cessions were made-practically given away - to the people, and yet, in spite of this new bed- rock tariff, the figures are satisfactory in every sense. Why, last month's return is the re- cord for the colony, so whilst the Government have been making very large remissions, still the Customs returns show wonderful buoy- ancy. The department estimates that the loss in Customs revenue last year by the remission of duties was #131,335. That amount, as I said before, was practically given away to the public. The following return shows the principal items on which the revenue has in- creased : Spirits, £22,836; tobacco, £15,843; cigars and cigarettes, $9,115. Now, let me ask, are those necessaries of life? Not in the slightest degree. Some people talk about a free breakfast-table, which is a very good thing, but none of these luxuries can be placed in that bill-of-fare; and these increases, with others, amount to £149,370. That is very satisfactory evidence that the condition of the colony is most flourishing. There can be no doubt whatever about that. Why, nothing less than Conservative Ministries could-and even they would find it difficult -- crush a fine little colony like this, although I admit its progress would be materially delayed. Now, I have not Mr. Mills time to enumerate all the sums that were collected annually for the past ten years. I may, however, briefly say that the gross revenue from Customs last year was £2,366,480, and I would like to point out, as Minister in charge, that we are working the Customs De- partment at a very reasonable rate. The cost of the department for the year ending 31st March, 1900, was £1 7s. 11d. per cent. That compares most favourably with other colonies, because when I refer to the most reliable statistics obtainable I find that the cost in Australia is as follows: New South Wales, £3 2s. 6d. ; Victoria, £3 38. 2d. : Queensland, $3 14s. 5d .; and South Australia, £4 3s. I think, Sir, that is a very favourable comparison for New Zealand, and I think the House will agree with me when I say that any slight increases in the salaries of that department are well earned, as the amount paid last year is only increased by £385. Mr. HUTCHESON .- It is shameful the way you treat that department. Mr. MILLS .- If the honourable gentleman means that we ought to raise the salaries of some of the officers, I agree with him. I would now like to read a comparative statement to honourable members, showing how the colony has progressed since 1891, up the 31st Decem- ber, 1900 :- Comparison of certain Statistics for Years ended 31st December, 1891 and 1900.
