And now, Sir, I must leave this special ques- tion, because my time is going. I must deal now with the revenue and expenditure. The following is a comparative statement of the revenue and expenditure for the years 1890-91, and 1901-2 : - 1890-1891 - 4,282,504 Revenue 4,175,108 Expenditure £107,396 1901-1902- 5,896,000 Estimated expenditure .

Actual revenue, 1890-91 4,282,504 .. Increase £1,613,496 Revenue comparatively in favour £24,700 Then, what will please members more than enough will be this : They will say, " How about your revenue, Mr. Treasurer ? Have you reason to believe that your estimates will be realised ? " Yes, Sir, I have, as the following figures will show :- Revenue for the Five Months ended 31st August, 1901, and for the corresponding Period of last Year. (Consolidated Fund).

There is also an increase in railways up to the present time. Let me compare the figures with the figures for five months last year :- d. d. 6. 8. 140,545 13 3 April 155,551 11 6 .. 9 May 153,084 147,176 10 7 8 ..

Then, I want at this stage to say what has been done to help to bring the country to this prosperous state. A great deal has been said against members on this side of the House ; but our friends of the country and our friends of the town will know how to value that. The Opposition are at their old tactics by trying to sow dissension. I would here advise the country, and the country repre- sentatives in this House: I say, do not set brother against brother -the brother in the country against the brother in the town-but keep them together as one whole, working for the common good, working for the benefit of themselves and the people of our fair colony, and for the good of the children who are to come after them. Let not party politics, let not the exigencies of the party opposite interfere with or destroy the harmony that exists. Let all work together for the general good. Then, to show that we have not neg- lected the country districts, I may mention that the advances to settlers amounts to £2,000,000; that, under the Land for Settle- ments Act, we have expended £1,710,000; in the Agricultural Department £25,000, upon cool-storage, grading of produce, experimental stud-farms, poultry breeding, et cetera. Then, by the removal of the duty from agricultural machinery I am losing £1,500 a year. Can it be said, then, that we are doing nothing for the farmer? I have had it taken out pound by pound what we have given to the farmers and pastoralists of the country on our rail- ways, in remissions specially affecting them, and it amounts to £78,000 this year, or a total of $248,000 during the last five years. And yet there are some honourable gentlemen who will say that we are not helping the farmers of the country. I say to those who are the representatives of labour in this House, that we have given the labourers of the coun- try legislation. We have given them the ex- pense connected with Conciliation Boards and Arbitration Courts ; but, as regards monetary assistance, we have given them nothing in com- parison to what we have given the farmers of the country. And, what is more, they have not asked for it ; nor do they begrudge the farmers what we have done for them ; but they have helped us to do it, because they recognise that if the farmers are prosperous there must also be prosperity in the towns, and we have a prosperous New Zealand. What did those
