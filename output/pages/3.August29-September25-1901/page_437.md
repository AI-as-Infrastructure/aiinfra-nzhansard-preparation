Mr. SEDDON. - Has this anything to do | shrieking like a whipped child this after- with the matter before the House ? Mr. HARDY .- I certainly have no right, Sir, to detain the House on this question, but later on I will have an opportunity of talking to the Premier about it. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL (Riccarton) .- I think it is matter for regret that in discussing this question the Right Hon. the Premier has shown so much heat. He has not only pro- ceeded to attack the members of the House generally, but also cast a gross reflection upon his own colleague the Minister for Railways, who was leading the House in his absence. The Premier, in the course of his speech, said that the House, having passed a resolution that a breach of privilege had been committed, should at once have ordered the guilty person to appear before the bar of the House. That, Sir, is the very course that was suggested to the leader of the House-Sir J. G. Ward-at the time by the honourable member for Bruce. If the Premier would refer to Hansard, page 658, he will see there that the member for Bruce stated the whole procedure, quoted the rulings of the Speakers, and said it would be most unfair that the person who had been declared to have committed a breach of privilege should not at once be given an opportunity of ap- pearing before the House to justify his action. I can only suppose that the Premier must have a disordered liver when he proceeds to lecture the members of the House, and to cast so grave a reflection on his own colleague, who was temporarily in charge of the business of the country while the honourable gentleman was bar-bound at Greymouth. But, Sir, the honourable gentleman has certainly got into his old form when he dresses down the member for Christchurch City. Up to the present period of the session the Premier has regarded the honourable member for Christchurch City as having returned to the fold ; but now things have changed. And yet I think, when it comes to any question of loss of dignity, the character of Mr. Collins will not lose by comparison with the Premier. All that honourable gentleman did was simply to humorously point out to the Minister of Justice that he was wrong in his law. The Hon. the Minister of Justice had said that the resolution as proposed by the Premier yesterday included a fine, and the honourable member for Christchurch City (Mr. Collins) pointed out-perfectly correctly, in my opinion -that the resolution as proposed com- pels no fine, because it does not impose the penalty of Â£15 on any particular person. But what I want to refer to briefly is the position of the honourable member for Wel- lington City (Mr. Fisher). He has from time to time taxed a number of members on this side of the House who have been in- dependent, and I wish to warn him of the position in which he stands. I warn the honourable member that if he continues in his present independent attitude he is going to bring trouble upon himself. Now, Sir, I wish to deal with the position in which the Premier finds himself to-day. He has been noon because of the position in which he finds himself ; but who was responsible for that position ? Why, the Premier. The House had declared that a breach of privilege had been committed, and on the motion of the Minister for Railways it set up a Committee to ascer- tain what had led to that breach. Before the Committee the principal person involved refused to give evidence on the point essential to the whole inquiry. What happened then ? Why, the Premier, having returned to lead the House, proposed yesterday that the letter that has been sent by the Dunedin Evening Star reporter is to be accepted "as satisfactory." There is the gravamen of the whole position. He proposed to impose no fine with regard to the two offences that have been committed in connection with this matter. For I say there are two offences-first, the publication ; and, second, the absolute refusal of the reporter to give the evidence asked for. I am not dealing as to how far he was justified or not justified in not giving that evidence. The Premier has quoted from a letter in which a reporter of a newspaper proceeds to lecture this House as to what it ought to do. Is that letter to be ac- cepted as satisfactory? Is that recognising the dignity of the House? First of all we learn this motion was sent down by the Cabinet, which resolved that the action of the Dunedin Star reporter is to be accepted as satisfactory, and then the honourable gentleman's colleague (Mr. McGowan) proceeds to move that the words "as satisfactory " be struck out of the Premier's motion. Thus the Minister of Mines proposes to negative the Cabinet's resolution that the letter is satisfactory ; and after this has been done there comes another colleague of the Premier's, Mr. Hall-Jones, and moves that a fine of $15 be inserted. Therefore, you have first the united sense of the Cabinet saying that the letter of the reporter of the Star shall be accepted "as satisfactory"; following that comes the Minister of Mines to move that it is not satisfactory ; and then, following him, the Minister for Public Works moving that a fine of $15 be inflicted. And this is the strong Cabinet. This is the operation of the giant intellect that can rule the whole country and boss the House and boss New Zealand, and show everybody what is the proper way to maintain our privileges! They do not know their own minds for twenty-four hours. And then they call a caucus to settle what the amount of the fine is to be. Mr. FISHER .- No, no. Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- Perhaps the honour- able gentleman knows more about it than I do; That is the position. I was not at the caucus. Now, when the Premier moved the motion that the reporter's letter be accepted as satisfactory, he was paying the Dunedin Star for something. And what was it ? The Dunedin Star reporter possesses the reputation of being the best in- formed newspaper correspondent in New Zea- land. And I believe he is; I believe he gets many of his tips straight from the Premier. At any rate, a large number of them come out
