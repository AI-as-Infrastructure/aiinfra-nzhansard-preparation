We say ' attempted,' because, in spite of the notorious fact that it was no longer desired, ex- cept by the Premier, that he should continue to perform in that capacity, he persisted on all or most occasions in that enterprise. There are some wiseacres who predict a ' coalition' be- tween Mr. Seddon and Captain Russell. There is to be nothing of the kind. He is of far more use to Mr. Seddon as he is-a phantom leader of an Opposition which does not exist- a bogey to frighten naughty Liberal children, and drive them into the division lobby." Now, the Opposition party being disorganized and disintegrated, as I have shown it to be, what useful purpose can be served by playing into the hands of those disjointed units, as some members of our party have done during this debate? Nothing is to be gained. We have simply been wounded in the house of our friends. Now, after the exhaustive and ex- husting financial statement of the honourable member for Nelson City, and some other finan- cial speeches to which we have listened, I pro- pose to place on record a few figures relating to the finances of the colony, but put in such a form-I say it with all submission-that the people of the colony will be well able to understand them. The honourable member for Dunedin City (Mr. Millar) stated that the public debt of the colony had been increased in ten years-that is, during the tenure of office of the present Ministry-by the sum of sixteen millions. I claim no particular merit for the compilation of my figures, because a clerk could compile them quite easily. I claim credit only for the industry and the care with which 1 have tabulated them. Their value is that they are thoroughly authentic and reliable, for they are taken from the Treasury tables attached to every Financial Statement for the past eighteen years. It will be understood, there- fore, that if any member of this House laughs at the figures contained in the following tables he is laughing not at me, but at the Treasury tables attached to every Financial Statement. Now, here are the figures for the nine years prior to the present Ministry taking office. As to the gross indebtedness-and surely that word " gross " covers all indebtedness Mr. MILLAR .- Give us the net. Mr. FISHER .- I will give both. The gross public debt for the nine years from the 31st March, 1882, to the 31st March, 1891, is shown as follows in the Treasury tables :- 31st March, 1882 29,946,771 .. 30,351,111 1883 .. 1884 32,367,711 .. 1885 33,691,022 . . 1886 34,965,222 . . 1887 37,558,553 1888 36,758,437 1889 38,375,050 . .. 1890 38,667,950 . .. 1891 38,832,350 .. Increase (nine years) .. 8,885,579 VOL. CXVIII .- 7. for those nine years was increased at the rate of one million a year. Here, now, is the Treasury statement of the gross and net public debt for the ten years of office of the present Govern- ment. I call the attention of the member for Dunedin City (Mr. Millar) to the fact that the gross and net debt are both shown, and he will see that the increase in the colonial indebted- ness for the last ten years is approximately the same as the increase for the preceding nine years-namely, one million a year :- Gross Debt. Net Debt. £ 38,713,068 31st March, 1892 37,677,619 39,257,840 1893 38,144,070 .. 39,826,415 1894 38,-74,491 .. 1895 40,386,964 39,635,032 .. 43,050,780 1896 42,271,889 1897 43,552,324 44,366,618 .. 1898 44,963,424 44,081,521 .. 46,938,006 1899 46,080,727 .. 47,874,452 1900 46,930,076 49,591,245 48,557,751 1901 .. Increase (ten years) 10,878,177 10,880,132 The increase for the ten years is £10,878,177, or a little more than a million a year. Of .course, I know how useless challenges are, but I am so certain of these figures that I challenge tho honourable member, or I challenge any other honourable member in this House to prove that they are inaccurate or incorrect. An Hon. MEMBER. - You are not adding out- standing liabilities. Mr. FISHER .- How long do outstanding liabilities outstand? They must come in at some time or other, and are then included in the general colonial indebtedness. An Hon. MEMBER .- No. Mr. FISHER .- Will the outstanding liabili- ties account for the difference of six millions between your statement and mine ? An Hon. MEMBER .- Yes. Mr. FISHER. - What nonsense! Next, I have another interesting table showing the state of the Interest Account for the past twelve years :- Year ended 31st March, 1890 1,897,602 1891 1,858,252 . . . 1892 1,892,929 1893 1,821,128 1894 1,885,696 .. 1895 1,716,889 1896 1,683,775 1,700,460 1897 .. 1898 1,741,412 1899 1,767,467 .. 1900 1,768,992 .. 1901 1,745,615 .. Decrease (twelve years) .. 151,987 The interest-charge for the year ending the 31st March, 1900, was £1,897,602, and the interest this year with that increased indebtedness was £1,745,615 -a decrease of £151,987. I will presently show the effect of that reduction upon the revenue account.
