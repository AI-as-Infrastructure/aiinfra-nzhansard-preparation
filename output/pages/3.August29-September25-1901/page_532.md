electorate, and is it any wonder that I ask the question, having in view the fly in amber, How did he get here ? Sir, there is no doubt that beau- tiful amber does sometimes show to advantage grubs and worms; but I say the Parliament of the country is no place to beautify and em- balm these political worms and place them on show. Sir, during this debate have we heard that there has been an under-estimate of our revenues ? Certainly not. Even the mem- ber for Palmerston has not said that. But the Opposition have wished the House and the people of the colony to infer that my esti- mate of the receipts will not be realised. In regard to our expenditure, I admit that this year it is abnormally high. But who is responsible? Is the Government to be con- demned for that abnormally high expenditure? I say that during the past year there were cir- cumstances that were absolutely beyond the control of the Government, and, instead of members finding fault with us, there ought to have been general pleasure expressed that we were able to meet the extra expense without additional taxation, and that we are in a position to look forward,-as I do with hope,-to have a surplus at the end of next year of over £100,000. The abnormal expenditure, I may remark, totalled £120,000. In the Budget the Government advise a course . of prudence and economy. We advise that the colony should go "slow " in regard to borrow- ing and in regard to expenditure, and, because we have done that, the Opposition and Conser- vative Press of the colony have, like a pack of hounds, taken up the cry, and the next we hear https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.32106019788253 from them is that it has been their advice that the colony should go "slow," and practice prudence and economy. I say, therefore, that there has been a complete indorsement of our policy in the colony in regard to the slowing. down of our expenditure, and that, instead of being condemned for that policy, we ought rather to be extolled for advising it at the proper time, and not at a time when too late, and when difficulties had arisen. Later on I shall deal with our candid friends. First of all, I wish to speak of the finances of the colony, and if I have the time I shall reply to the state- ments of our Opposition and candid friends later on ; but, in saying what I wish to say on our finances, I have no doubt I shall at the same time be dealing generally with what our adverse critics have urged against the Budget. The actual increase of the indebtedness of the colony has been one of the principal charges levelled against us, and I will meet it at once. It has been said that the tu quoque argu- ment is not fair. Well, I say that, taking the ten years' administration of previous Govern- ments, a sum of £11,638,639 was added to the public debt from the year 1881 to the year 1889, or an average of one million and a half per annum. What is the average of the present Administration ? In the ten years, 1891-1900 the amount added to the public debt was £9,206,502. I have a complete table to show the amounts, and I will read it :- Mr. Seddon 1880 to 1890, and from 1890 to 1900. Gross Debt. Year. At close of Annual each Year.

That is a fact that has been kept back from the people. The next question is, How is that done? I will show how it is done.
