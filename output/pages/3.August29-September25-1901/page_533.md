Then, on that we are paying £283,856 by way of interest, but we receive from it £344,831 in the way of interest, or a profit over interest of £60,975. What reply have the members op- posite, or our mistaken and misguided candid friends, to say to that fact ? The amount of non- reproductive money added to the public debt for the last ten years is only £4,642,938. That is all that can be reasonably put against us as compared with the public indebtedness placed on the colony by preceding Ministries. Then, Sir, I take the average. The average during the last thirty years-since the inauguration of the public works policy-has been £1,380,866 a year. I have a table prepared to prove that, and I intend to put that table on record and prove every figure :- https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.32106019788253 Average Annual Increase of Public Debt from 1871 to 1901 (Thirty Years).

Gross public debt-thirty years 1871-1901 .. 41,426,000 The following are the increases made in the public debts by the different Ministries :- 1871-73 (Fox Ministry) .. 1,445,095 1874-1876 (Vogel Ministry) 6,855,326 . . 1877 (Atkinson Ministry) 3,439,350 .. 1878-79 (Grey Ministry) 2,125,600 .. 1880-82 (Hall Ministry) .. 6,450,500 .. 1883 (Whittaker Ministry) 965,900 1884 (Atkinson Ministry) 1,626,571 1885-1887 (Stout-Vogel Ministry) .. 4,670,071 1888 91 (Atkinson Ministry) 3,088,697 1892-93 (Ballance Ministry) 437,490 . . 1894-1901 (Seddon Ministry) 10,333,405 Total amount under Hall Administration (three years), £6,450,500, or an average of £2,150,166. Total amount under Atkinson Ministry (six years), $8,154,618, or an average of £1,359,103 per annum. Total under Seddon Administration (eight years), £10,333,405, or an average of £1,291,675. Taking the average of non-interest-bearing indebtedness it has only been #296,625 a year, as against the Atkinson Administration of £1,359,103 per annum. The amount for three years under the Hall Administration was £6,400,000-or an average of £2,156,000 & vear. The total amount of the Atkinson Ministry for six years was £8,154,618-an average of about £1,359,000 a year. The average of the Seddon Administration has been only £1,291,167. From 1871 to 1891-thirty years-there was a total increase of forty- one millions-an average of £1,380,000. The average for the ten years the present Liberal party have been in office has been £1,076,000. The average for the ten years before that was £1,064,000. Now, take from this ten millions the four millions and a half, and what does it give you ? It gives you the non-interest- bearing debt at £296,000 a year for ten years, and that with a population of 750,000. Con- trast that with the preceding ten years, when the population averaged half a million people, and I ask, Who has been heaping debt upon the people of the colony? You must consider how the population of the country has increased, and the wealth of the colony has also increased. The argument of the honourable member for Dunedin City (Mr. Millar) was, "No babies, no loan." He in his speech gave the increased indebtedness relative to the increased popula- tion, and said that in ten years our indebted- ness increased 33 per cent., whilst the popula- tion increased 19 per cent. He omitted to state that if you take the non-interest-producing debt, we have only increased the indebtedness of the colony by 11 per cent., as against an in- crease of population of 19 per cent. That is a complete answer to everything said by the honourable member on that head. If you go to a banker and ask him for an advance the first question he asks you is not " How many children have you got ?" but " What security have you got to offer for the advance you wish to have ? " I have proved that our coun- try has so improved in material wealth and population that we were fully warranted in increasing our public debt at the moderate rate I have indicated. I wish to explain also that in the indebtedness $250,000 in ten years was annually given by previous Ministers to local bodies, whilst during our term of office we have advanced £1,104,000. That is a still further reduction. The non-interest-bearing money has been $751,000, local bodies' repayments £80,000, and advances for roading $244,955. There is the answer to that point. Then, I take the public debt per head of population. On the 31st March, 1891, it was £64 3s. 7d., and on the 31st March, 1901, it was £61 19s. 4d., a decrease of £2 4s. 3d. per head. But take again
