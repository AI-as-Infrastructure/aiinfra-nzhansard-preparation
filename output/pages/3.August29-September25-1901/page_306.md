I do not know how the Opposition can possibly answer that, and how they can support the statements that they have made that this Government has been running the colony into debt more than any http://www.hathitrust.org/access use#cc-zero previous Government. Mr. SEDDON. -- And more than half our in- crease is interest-producing. Mr. FIELD .- I am just coming to that. The country is told by honourable gentlemen on that side of the House that this money is earning nothing, and that nothing comes back from it. They might just as well say that because a farmer owns a farm worth $1,000, upon which he owes a mortgage of £500, and sees next door to him another farm worth £1,000 that he requires, and finds he may purchase for £750, of which he has only £250 in cash, and because he borrows £500 more to buy it-they might just as well say in that case he is a very silly man, that in one act he has increased his indebtedness by $500, and that in doing so he is rushing headlong to destruction, forgetting altogether the excellent bargain he has made for himself, and the clear profit he has earned by the transaction. So it is with our public debt at the present time. Every penny has been well invested, and most of it, such as moneys lent by the Advances to Settlers Office, is earning more interest than we are paying for it. I think in the case of Native land purchases our invest- ments are almost too good. In. many cases we Mr. Field have been bought. Now, coming to our rail- ways, I will just take a few extracts from the Railways Report which is just to hand. The excess of earnings over working-expenses for 1900-1901 was £599,389, as against £571,533 for the previous year, showing an increased net return for the year of £27,856. Is that an indication that our expenditure is ahead of our revenue? Further, it is estimated that the value of the concessions which have been made to the public in various ways by the reduction of railway fares and charges was equiva- lent to a rebate of £75,000, based on the traffic and charges for the previous year. The gross revenue for the year amounted to £1,727,236, and the net revenue to £599,389, increases over the previous year of £103,345 and £27,856 respectively. The gross revenue ex- ceeded the estimate by £167,236. The total revenue derived from goods and live - stock traffic was £1,109,548, an increase of £69,166 over the receipts for the previous year. That surely does not look like rushing headlong to ruin! I ask honourable gentlemen, Do not these figures speak for themselves, and show that our posi- tion is a very satisfactory one indeed ? Now, in speaking of railways, I should like to read for the information of those members who complain that we are rushing into debt, and who are at the same time urging the Govern- ment to spend all they possibly can on railway construction in their own particular districts, & few figures showing the expenditure in the June quarter of 1901 as compared with the expenditure in the June quarter of 1900 :- 0 B. d: 6 7 1,457 18 10 4377 6 2 883 15 4 2 543 16 11 Increase. 2,869 14 5 2 235 15 1,134 15 5,743 17 7,986 11 6,884 32 7,606 236 € 2,068 18 3 d. 5 00 1,024 17 0 7,820 1 7 8 0 6 543 16 11 4 9 1 5 Quarter, 235 15 2,916 13 8,035 19 8,298 3 1 9 92 13 8.
