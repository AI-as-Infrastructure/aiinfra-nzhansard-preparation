I will say this to the Press : that I hope they will resent Committee, by considering only the evidence brought in chief, and not having heard the this action of the Premier, and will say to the Premier that they are able to look after them- cross-examination.

I think the Chairman and every member of has come to this: that portions of the Press the Committee will . admit that, and that are to be benefited at the expense of other portions. And is not that the case to-day in what was said in the first instance was largely qualified by what was said afterwards.

What papers get those reports before the House gets them ? Why, the papers newspaper. It is the first time I ever heard of that the Premier wants to smooth over. That it in my life. The Evening Star, as far as I am is one of the ways in which the Premier wishes concerned in politics, has always dealt fairly to smooth over the Press. Some papers receive with me, and it is one of those papers that those departmental reports before they are laid takes both sides. It takes the side of Sir on the table. It is well known that the Pre- Joseph G.

It is to such means that the Premier is continually hurling across this Premier descends in order to keep himself on Chamber. It is absolutely without a tittle of the Treasury benches. I regret extremely that truth. On the contrary, I should be only too the Premier has shown himself so weak on glad to protect, if I could, the editor and this question.
