indebtedness -take that for the seven millions. -and then see where your indebtedness comes in : because the general population is only called upon to pay on the non-interest-bearing debt, and, if you take it on that basis, it is only £54 per head, as compared with €61 per head- that is to say, it is less per head on the basis of population by $7 17s. 6d. sterling. The follow- ing table gives the figures :- Rate per Head of European Population. s. d. Public debt- 31st March, 1901 49,591,245 64 3 .. 1891 38,830,350 .. 61 19 .. €10,760,895 £2 4 3 Increase But if the interest-earning amounts of the public debt, as on the 31st March, 1901, be deducted, the calculation stands thus :- Rate per Head of European Population. s. d.

Decrease. . .. £2,966,259 £7 17 This represents a decrease. Now we come to the question of taxation, and the rate per head of taxation :- Taxation per Head of European Population. Rate per Amount.

But take the condition of the people of this colony to pay now, as compared with a little over ten years ago, where you had shelter-sheds, thousands of people unable to find employment and leaving the country, when there was misery in our land, and ask yourselves this question : Are not the people of this colony better able to pay 4s. 1d. per head as an increase, when we con- sider the miserable condition of the people in 1889 and 1890? There is the answer. You must take the condition of the people to bear the burden. Then, take the interest and sink. ing funds. I have prepared a statement here showing the average amount paid as interest :- Mr. Seddon loans :- (a.) 1881-1891- £ Average amount paid on non- 1,685,842 .. interest-earning money Average amount paid on inter- 3,310 est-earning money .. (b.) 1891-1901- Average amount paid on non- 1,676,035 interest-earning money Average amount paid on inter- 95,342 est-earning money (2.) Interest per head of population :- (a.) 1881-1891- # s. d.

On £95,342 (interest-earning) 2 0 1891-1901 - On £44,296 (interest- earning and paid from separate 1 3 0 accounts) .. The interest per head of population in 1881 to 1891 was $2 18s. 4d., while for 1901 it is £2 7s. 3d. So that, per head of population, it is now really less than it was. Taking the non- interest-bearing debt into consideration, it is less than it was ten years ago. There is the answer to that. Then I come to the next ques- tion-that is, the progress of the colony, and the ability of the people to bear the increased 4 indebtedness and to pay the interest :- 6 Statistical Comparisons for Whole Colony. 1900.

And, Sir, I say if that is not a complete answer to anything that has been said in respect to our moderate borrowing no one can give it. There is the condition of the country and the security we have to offer : and there is no country, I believe, in the British Empire that stands better than New Zealand does at the present moment. However, the increase, as I have said, is $15,000,000 on the unimproved, and on the improved #24, 774.000
