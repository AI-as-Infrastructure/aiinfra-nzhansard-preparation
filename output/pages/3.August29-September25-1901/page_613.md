On the question, That this Bill be read a first time, Mr. SEDDON (Premier) said. It is my inten- tion to ask the House to pass this Bill through all its stages as a matter of urgency, because I found out three days ago that the appointment. of Mr. Justice Cooper as President of the Arbi- tration Court had not been made. He had been appointed as Judge of the Supreme Court all right, and probably it might have been pre- sumed the one appointment carried the other. We find that it requires a separate appointment for the position of President of the Arbitration Court under the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act. An Hon. MEMBER .- Was that done in Judge Martin's case ? Mr. SEDDON .- It was not necessary in Judge Martin's case ; it was not required, see- ing he only filled in a term. Of course, I have to take the responsibility of the oversight. There was not a separate appointment in Judge Martin's case, because he filled up the gap which was left. Mr. Justice Williams was ap- pointed for three years, and Mr. Justice Edwards acted for a portion of the time. It is pro- vided that a Judge may be appointed to fill a part of an unexpired term. Mr. Justice Martin filled another part of an unexpired term. How- ever, as another vacancy had come round, it wanted another appointment before the matter was in order. It was an oversight, and this Bill is necessary to rectify it. Mr. HUTCHESON (Wellington City) .- Per- haps it may not be out of place to ask the Premier whether he still intends to proceed with the payment of fees to the Judge of the Arbitration Court ? Mr. SEDDON .- This Bill has nothing to do with the question of fees. Mr. HUTCHESON .- Oh, yes, it has to do with the question of fees ; and the Premier will hear more about it before we have done with this Bill. I consider the payment of these fees is a highly unconstitutional thing. Bill read a first time. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- Sir, I move the second reading of the Bill. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) .- Will it not be necessary for the Premier to move for the suspension of the Standing Orders ? Mr. DEPUTY - SPEAKER .- No; it is a matter of urgency. Mr. HERRIES. - Sir, I think we want more explanation from the Premier about this matter.
