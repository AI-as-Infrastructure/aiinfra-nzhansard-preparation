beyond its means-it is the duty of every honourable member to speak out, independent of what the consequences may be, and that is what I intend to do to-night. Now, amongst other things which have been misleading us for many years has been the statement that the Public Works Fund has been aided to the extent of $500,000 out of revenuc. It is per- fectly true that in a certain sense you may call it revenue, but if you take the actual revenue for the ten years from all the revenue- producing departments, what do you find ? You will find this result - I do not wish to weary members by reading the whole of this return ; but as it has been ruled in this House by the Hon. the Speaker that unless you read the table completely you have no power to have it inserted in Hansard, I feel compelled to do so, and detain the 7.30. House for a few moments while I go through it. The following table shows the actual revenue which has been received for the ten years during which the present party has been in power :- d.

The total, as I have shown, is $45.913.818 13s. 1d. If honourable members will subtract the expenditure from the revenue they will find that there is a credit balance of $832,781 19s. 4d. And, to be fair to the Government, that surplus has arisen during the last four years. During that period we have been given to understand that there has been transferred to the credit of the Public Works Fund a balance of $2.445,000. All that is left of the actual revenue claimed to be transferred is $832,000. It is well for us, ! Mr. Millar and how much borrowed money. During the ten years they received from released sinking funds $1,234,065. Surely, that cannot be called revenue when it is added to the perma- nent debt, and when it is exactly the same as if it were borrowed money. They received from the proceeds of the sale of debentures against accretions to sinking funds $1,362,900. They also received from the sales of Crown lands ¥1,085.842, and they received from consols $450,389 : the total amount being $4,142,196 of extraneous aid, which in no sense can be called revenue, because every one of these sink- ing funds were tangible assets of the colony against the debt, but they have disappeared, and been added to the net debt of the colony. So that, instead of having transferred £2.445,000 out of the revenue, the most that they can claim under any circumstances is $832.000. And, I say, because of the fact that honourable members have thought year after year that this transfer from the consolidated revenue to the Public Works Fund was what might be called a bona fide transfer of revenue, and could be afforded, we have not taken the trouble- and I blame myself along with others -- to go so deeply into the financial position as we ought to have. I regret having to speak to-night in the way I am doing, as it is not a pleasure to me ; but no member of the House who has the welfare of the colony at heart can get up in his place and say that the colony is in a sound position; and this is the neces- sity that causes me to say this, because this is the time that this House and the country should know what the true position is, so that we might avoid a repetition of the troubles of 1887. According to writers on political economy, where the population of the country increases, the debt per head of population is supposed to decrease ; and during the ten years in which the present party have been in power, we find that while in 1891 the population of the colony was 634,058, in 1900 - which is the latest date I can take, because I have not taken the present census, as I could not then make the comparison necessary owing to figures not being available-the population was 758,616, or an increase during that period of 124,558, being almost equal to 19 per cent. of the population. Now, as I said, you would imagine that, with an increase of 19 per cent. of the population, the debt per head and the taxation per head would have been reduced. But what are the actual facts? In 1891 the debt per head of the population of the colony was $59 11s. 1od., whereas in 1900 the debt had risen to £61 17s. 3d., an increase of $2 5s. 5d. per head, despite the fact that there was an increase of 19 per cent. in the population. Then, let us go into the taxation per head, and see how it stands. In 1891 the taxation per head in the colony was $3 10s., and in 1900 it was $3 16s. 10d., or an increase of almost 10 per cent. You have, there- fore, this anomaly : that while the population has increased the taxation also has increased. I would ask any honourable member to take the trouble to find out for himself what would
