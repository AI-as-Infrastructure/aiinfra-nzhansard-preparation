funds ? Mr. FISHER .- I am not dealing with sink- ing funds. There is the statement of the gross indebtedness of the colony, and there is the state of the annual interest-charge. An Hon. MEMBER .- We do not pay any sinking funds now. Mr. FISHER .- Then, there is less burden upon the revenue. Here is something for the "Palmerston corner " to laugh at. Now, what was the effect upon the revenue of the interest- charge on our colonial indebtedness when this Government took office ? The total yield from Customs revenue, property-tax, and registra- tion-fees for the year ending the 31st March, 1890, the year before this Government took office, was as follows :- € Customs (including primage duty) .. 1,500,873 Property-tax 355,460 Registration and other fees 38,770 .. .. Total .. £1,895,103 And in that year the revenue from those three great main sources was swallowed up in this way :- Interest-charge on loans 1,897,602 . . Customs, property-tax, and registra- tion and other fees (as above) 1,895,103 .. Interest-charge in excess £2,499 .. Difference in favour of the interest - charge, £2,499. The position, then, was this: The Customs, property - tax, and registration - fees https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.32106019788253 being absorbed, we were left with only the pro- ceeds of the beer duty, railways, stamps, and miscellaneous to carry on the public service of the country. Now, mark the contrast. The http://www.hathitrust.org/access use#cc-zero total yield from Customs revenue, land- and income-tax, and registration and other fees for the year ending the 31st March, 1901, was as follows :- Customs 2,180,861 .. Land- and income-tax 468,391 . . .. Registration and other fees 67,537 Total 2,716,789 Interest-charge on loans 1,745,615 Balance of revenue from these three sources in ex- cess of interest-charge .. £971,174 What a change ! That is solid prosperity. There is, instead of a deficit, a credit balance of £971,174-well towards a million of money. That is a remarkable difference in the two positions. And are not those gentlemen on the Government benches entitled to credit for this change in the state of our finances ? An Hon. MEMBER .- The interest statement is not correct. Mr. FISHER .- That cannot possibly be; but, if it is not correct, whose fault is that ? An Hon. MEMBER .- The Treasury. sible. It is absurd to challenge the Treasury figures. They are not the Government figures. My next table shows how the population has increased and how the trade of the country has expanded. The figures are as follow :- Revenue Population. Receipts. 1890 625,508 3,994,504 . 1891 634,058 4,078,784 . 1892 650,433 4,219,535 .. 1893 672,265 4,368,537 1894 686,128 4,399,795 .. 1895 698,706 4,544,151 1896 714,162 4,796,098 .. 1897 729,056 4,987,629 1898 5,186,428 743,463 .. 1899 756,505 5,699,618 1900-1901 772,719 5,906,916 .. Increase (ten years) 147,211 1,912,412 These figures may be viewed with satisfaction ; but the next table, I confess, I regard with a feeling of alarm. It is the table which shows the increases in the annual appropriations, which, as I have often called it, is " the wages- sheet of the country." It shows in reality the cost of governing the country. These are the figures for the past twelve years :- Year 1889-90 4,278,852 .. 1890-91 4,241,182 .. . 1891-92 4,337,706 .. 1892-93 4,344,437\* .. . 1893-94 4,460,547 .. 1894-95 4,350,200 .. - 1895-96 4,362,862 .. 1896-97 4,532,179 .. 4,669,074 1897-98 .. 1898-99 4,849,830 . .. 1899-1900 5,059,729 .. . 1900-1901 5,573,294 .. .. 1901-1902 5,763,814 .. .. Increase (twelve years) .. £1,484,962 Land Fund amalgamated. These figures show that the cost of governing the country has increased at the rate of £120,000 a year for the past twelve years, and I take leave to consider that an alarming increase. This table arrests my attention more than any other, because while it is, no doubt, gratifying to see that the population has increased, al- though not so rapidly as the Colonial Treasurer desires, that the revenue receipts are expand- ing year after year, it is the reverse of satisfac- tory to find the cost of the Civil government increasing at the rate of £120,000 a year. It ought to be remembered that we have a Civil organization equal to the requirements of a population of two millions of people, and no effort appears to be made to restrain the demands for public expenditure in this direc- tion. So far from any effort being made to restrain this class of expenditure, we have, as the honourable member for Wairarapa, Mr. Hornsby, pointed out, increases in salaries proposed in the estimates for the year amount-
