honourable member for Wellington, who says, | lington City should question the right of the " I cannot accept that letter." There are other members, as, for instance, the honourable member for Egmont, Mr. Symes, who says, " I cannot accept that letter." The honourable member for Waikato is flouting the House and those members, by putting them in a posi- tion in which they must say " Yes " or "No" to accepting that letter. I only rose to point out to members the false position in which they are placed-or, rather, the attempt to place them in a false position-by the insertion of these words. If the member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher), or any other member, wishes a further explanation with respect to who shall pay the #15, then it is for them to move an addition to that, and not to insert the words here : " the House accepts this letter." I ask members, under these circumstances, what is behind this ? This debate has concluded. The member for Bruce has asked, and rightly so, that we should go on with the business of the colony ; and yet this is done to further delay the decision of the House upon this question. If the majority of members in this House are to rule, if the business of the country is to progress, are we, I ask, to be flouted ? Are we to be prevented from going on with the business, and from doing our duty, by such by this means. amendments as this? If there was anything to find fault with in the amendment moved by the Minister for Public Works, then, if the member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher) desired to be fair in his criticism, why has he not criticised the present amendment, which gave him an opportunity of making the speech we have just listened to. Mr. FISHER .- I do exactly as I please. Mr. SEDDON .- The honourable gentleman may do as he pleases, but, at the same time, I say it is his duty to me and every member of this House to be fair in his criticism, and to be have had this debate. That would have been fair to those from whom he differs. And if I ask him to be fair to me, surely the honourable member will not tell me, "I do as I like." I think his gentlemanly instincts and his generous nature would cause him to say that he would be fair to me. But I say that he was not fair in his criticism ; otherwise he is not aware of you. the amendment now before the Chair. Mr. FISHER .- I am aware of it, and will not support it. Mr. SEDDON .- Thank you. Mr. FISHER .- You need not thank me; I do not want thanks. upon the Evening Star- the question of the Mr. SEDDON .- Then, Sir, the honourable member said I had been guilty of an improper action in calling a meeting of the party. disagreeing with the action of the reporter; and Mr. FISHER .- I did not say it was im- I say, by placing it as it is placed before the proper. Mr. SEDDON .- Well, I accept the honour- able gentleman's denial. At all events, the clusion. In any Court of law, where the Court honourable gentleman did adversely criticize the action of myself and the Government in its decision by reciting that you, John Smith, calling together the party. Am I correct in that ? Mr. FISHER .- Yes. ever heard of such a decision as that. I say you Mr. SEDDON .- Very well, if I am right in never heard or read of anything of the sort. that I want to know why the member for Wel- leader of the party to take to his counsel those gentlemen in this House who are, like himself, members of that party. Mr. FISHER .- You are charging me with making a mistake in my tactics. Mr. SEDDON .- If that is what has hurt your feelings I am sorry for it. But it was not me that told the honourable gentleman he had made a mistake in his tactics. There is no feeling in it whatever; and if it happens, as it sometimes does happen, that we use words across the floor of the House-whilst admitting that the honourable gentleman had reason to be disappointed-still he has no right, again, to question the right of the leader of a party to call members together. Mr. FISHER .- I do not question your right. Mr. SEDDON. - Then the responsibility rests with me. On all occasions - whoever says to the contrary I care not-members of the Liberal party ever since I have been the leader of that party have always had a free hand, and I challenge any member of the House to stand in his place in the House and say I ever asked him to give a vote against his own convictions. Mr. FISHER .- You defeated my amendment Mr. SEDDON .- I took the counsel of mem- bers of my party so as to place the House in position to give effect to what is really the wish of the House ; and I say there are not two mem- bers in this House who want to fine the pub- lisher and who want to fine the reporter Â£25 each. The penalties you desire to impose were not what the members of the House desired, in my opinion ; and I tell you now, that if I had proposed at first, as an addition to my motion, to impose a fine of $5, to mark the sense of the House upon this question, that would have been imposed, and we would not carried, in my opinion, almost without debate. I say so now, and the silence of members of the House shows that they fairly well approve that that is correct. An Hon. MEMBER. - We cannot interrupt Mr. SEDDON .- Well, at all events, I say there was no desire on the part of any mem- ber of the House to inflict a heavy penalty. All that they are objecting to was that there should be some penalty, and a nominal penalty. I say that what is before the House calls Star having published this evidence is men- tioned here-and it also marks its sense in House, any one who can read or understand the English language must come to this con- is decreeing a penalty, it does not finish up must pay $2, you. John Brown, must pay $5, and you, John Williams, shall pay $6. Who-
