I say I really do not think it matters much if Mr. Flatman, say the other day that he it does take eight years. My reason for saying thought the railway from Springfield to Otira this is that if it is carried on as it has been in should be stopped. I understand there is a the past the colony will not get value for the tunnel there that is to cost a million and a money spent. I do not object to co-operative quarter. workers, for the men are paid for what they actually do. I believe that we have some workers on the North Island Trunk line who from Otira to Springfield, and I am told it is to make only 43. 6d. a day ; and no one will say cost a million and a quarter, and when it is that that is a large wage. Whichever side I finished the country between the tunnel and take I believe in stating the case fairly. I Springfield is simply useless. It will be good should not like honourable members to think that I am one-sided, and I do not wish to make statements that I cannot bear out, scandalous waste of money, to carry this on. I am sorry I cannot speak of the Otago Central but I believe there are some workers there who do not make more than 4s. 6d. per day. from personal observation, but I remember the But what I maintain is that we should not late Sir John Mckenzie said it was useless to go further than where the railway takes the carry this railway any further-that it was going material for its construction.

They cannot even now ride down the main road. as the money will go. In the past we have Mr. HALL-JONES. - It has been like that every year.

Now, money has not only been borrowed for railways, but for making money has been misspent in making roads. many tracks have been made which are really useless. The late Minister of Lands, of course, owing to illness, could not attend personally to his department; but I think the present Minister will adopt a better system, and start from where the roads are good and make them good as far been proceeding in this way : A small bit has been done in one corner of the district and a bit has been finished the bit formerly done back districts should be taught the bene- fits of the Loans to Local Bodies Act.
