It was the Railways Statement now appearing in Hansard. The very rigid ruling in possession of the House that he wished to appear in Hansard. When the honourable laid down by Mr. Speaker O'Rorke in previous member received his copy of the Statement he sessions was this : In consequence of something could compare them, and he would find it was having been put into Hansard which had not been delivered in the House as part of a speech, exactly the same as the one that had been it was ruled that nothing should be allowed to laid on the table.

He believed the first time the Railways evening when this question was brought up, Statement was printed in Hansard was out of courtesy to the then Minister for Railways (Mr. Cadman), and the printing of the Mines Railways Statement should appear in Hansard Statement was quite a new innovation. He believed that it was only for the last couple of years or so that the Mines Statement had been printed in Hansard. Now, the proper place for these Statements was in the Appendices, where all the tables and plans illustrating the State- gentleman's motion, but, as was already said, ments appeared together. Members looked for them in the Appendices. They would get Han- sard full up of Statements if this precedent was continued. Hansard took up several volumes adhered to was this : that Hansard should con- every session, and was getting larger and larger every year, and if these Statements were put in, the next thing would be, that the Lands State- ment and other Statements would have to be put in. The only ending to this would be as he had he did not think it should be departed from always contended, that we would have to abolish Hansard, and if they did that it would be now.

They seemed to be getting into Standing Orders and " Rulings of the Speakers " matter. They were interrupting not only the said distinctly that nothing was to be put in debate on the Financial Statement, but also Hansard except what was spoken in the House. It would have to be done by the vote of the House, and he maintained that Mr. Speaker would have to suspend the Standing Orders troduce this motion. He did not think that before he put the question. He asked for Mr. Speaker s ruling. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER said there was like to quote a passage from " Rulings of the nothing in the Standing Orders of the House Speakers," where Mr. Speaker O'Rorke had which directed what should or should not ap- ruled as follows :- pear in Hansard. There was a report from the Reporting and Debates Committee which we acted upon, and he held in his hand Hansard any individual member could from day to day read a paper, and then, by moving that it be of last year, page 271, July 31st, where Mr. Speaker put the same question as had been laid on the table, thus interrupt the course of the day's business by raising a debate on the moved by the Minister for Railways to the subject of this paper. It is distinctly ruled House; and he was following exactly the pre- cedent already laid down. He was asked to that the order of business set down for the day Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) would like read in our speeches what we wished to appear through these figures in such a manner as to the House. He was not in the House this but he gathered that the motion was that the without being read to the House. Well, he was bound to say he agreed with the views of those who had already urged that if these reports were to be printed in Hansard in this way Han- sard would become of an unconscionable length. He had no wish to oppose the honourable Hansard was becoming very much too bulky.
