doubt wool is low in price; but if you look at the price of cattle and sheep you will see they are correspondingly high. No later than this morning I find the following prices quoted from Christchurch and printed in the Welling- ton Times : Prime beef, 24s. to 26s. ; North Island bullocks, £12 to £12 10s. ; local heifers, $6 17s. 6d. to £8 7s. 6d. ; calves, 22s. ; 3,000 mostly prime wethers, better price, and a rise of Is .- heavy wethers, 22s. to 23s. 6d. ; best ewes, 16s. to 19s. 6d .; others, 13s. to 15s. ; merino wethers, 14s. to 15s. 11d .; store sheep, mostly wethers and hoggets-wethers, 16s. 10d. to 17s. 10d. ; best hoggets to 15s. 4d. ; others, 10s. to 13s. 10d .; baconers, 35s. to 56s. 6d .- equal to 33d. to 4d. per pound. In the face of such prices, how can the prospect be gloomy ? I hope the statement I have made will cheer the hearts of those pessimists, more es- pecially on our side of the House, who, unfor- tunately for themselves, take a very gloomy view of the Financial Statement. He also states that the Government have no sinking fund. In my opinion, a sinking fund in con- nection with our loans for public works should not be created until the whole of our public works are completed, because what is the use of having a sinking fund while we are going on the London market and borrowing money at 4 per cent. and are only receiving 3 per cent. for it here. I say the Government are wise in taking the sinking funds. In regard to the falling off in the Customs, I have a list with which I shall be very pleased to en- lighten those pessimists who have stated that they have fallen off. It is as follows :- Customs Duties collected during the last Ten Yrars for Period ending 31st March in each Year. 1,625,173 1892 .. 1893 1,642,595 .. .. 1894 1,655,503 .. .. 1,569,787\* 1895 .. 1896 1,649,344 .. .. 1,818,893 1897 .. .. 1898 1,935,262 .. .. 1899 1,965,017 .. . . 1900 2,107,567\* .. 2,180,862 1901 .. . Change of tariff. Now, Sir, where does the falling-off 3.30. come in ? . I think members of the House ought to be well satisfied with the figures I have placed before them. It will enable them to see that, as far as the Customs duties of the colony are concerned, they have not fallen off, but have rather increased. Then, the Government have dealt generously with the people. They recognised last year that the people were paying too much through the Cus- toms revenue, and the reductions they made in that revenue in one year-1900-1901-amounted to £131,335, made up as follows : - Amount collected, Fi- nancial Year .900 have been collecte 1 Amount that would under Oid Rates.

No doubt some of the remissions have given a benefit to the con- sumers, but if we take tea, for instance, I agree with other members that, as far as the cost of it is concerned, the consumer has not benefited at all by the reduction. As for kerosene, no doubt the consumers have felt the benefit of the remission. At any rate, it has been a boon to the settlers in the country districte. In view of the increased tariff placed on the people through the Customs tariff, it would be as well to have these facts hansardised, so that those who read Hansard may understand how the Customs revenue has been increased. The following is a return showing the principal items on which revenue bas increased for the year ending the 31st March, 1901, as compared with the previous year :- Year ended Year ended Increase. 31st March, 31st March, - 1900. 1901. £ Spirits 444,618 421,782 22,836 .
