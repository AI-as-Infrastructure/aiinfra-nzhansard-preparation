of 0.50 per cent. over the rate (64.80) for the ! previous year. The expenditure per cent. of revenue for the last five years has been as follows :- 1896-1897 61.35 1899-1900 64.80 .. 1897-1898 65.30 62.30 1900-1901 . . .. 1898-1899 63.26 .. It will be observed that the ratio of expenses to earnings has steadily increased during the years indicated. The percentage of expenditure to revenue received is as follows :- Traffic . . .. Locomotive .. Car and wagon repairs . . Maintenance of way . Head Office Management . . i Departmental .. Less credit recoveries Net increase .. .

In this connection I would specially empha- size the fact that, notwithstanding that every effort has been made to cope with the growing traffic on the railways by the turning-out and importation of further rolling-stock, it is only with the greatest difficulty that the trade of the colony has been carried on. The engine-power and rolling-stock has been utilised to its utmost capacity, and the great amount of traffic has necessitated the running of an inordinate num- ber of special trains, and the payment of large sums for overtime over the whole of the railway sections of the colony. Until the rolling-stock is brought up to a reasonable condition this unsatisfactory method will to some extent con. tinue. The working-expenses for locomotive-power have decreased slightly, being £293,383, as against £295,542 for last year, and the locomo- tive charges per train mile have decreased 1.69d. Car and wagon repairs have increased from £76,555 in 1899-1900 to £91,532 for last year, an increase of £14,977, and the cost per train- mile has increased 0.36d. during the same period. The expenditure for maintenance of the line, buildings, bridges, and other structures, still continues to increase, the amount expended under this head for the year under review being £426,405, as against £394,619 for the previous The amounts chargeable to expenditure, Working Account, are as follow :- 1899-1900. 1900 1901.

The increased expenditure has been incurred on Kawakawa Section, £383; Whangarei, £164; Auckland, £3,185 ; Wellington - Napier-New Plymouth, £4,348; Hurunui-Bluff, £12,340; Westland, £9,056 ; Westport, £2,423 ; Nelson, $493. Kaihu and Picton Sections decreased £103 and £505 respectively. This increased expendi- ture, to which reference has been made on several occasions during the past five years, is attributable to the increasing age of the lines, the demands of the traffic for the employment of heavier and more powerful locomotives to haul greater loads at high speeds, thus necessi- tating the provision of heavier rails and stronger structures. The higher rate of wages paid and increased cost of materials have also very largely influenced the cost of maintaining the lines, as will be seen by the following figures :- Material. Labour. Cost per mile of line open 105.88 57.34 for traffic, 1899 Cost per mile of line open 109.64 74.65 for traffic, 1900 Cost per mile of line open 76.06 113.52 for traffic, 1901 .. The cost of bridge repairs and renewals dur- ing the year was $54,020, of which #10,620 was debited to capital, and the balance, £43,400, to working-expenses. The cost of maintenance per mile of railway open for traffic for the year ending the 31st March, 1901, was #196.14, against $187.99 for the preceding year.
