Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER took the chair at half- past two o'clock. PRAYERS. Mr. FISHER (Wellington City) .- Sir, I wish to speak to a question of privilege. Yesterday the Premier, in replying to a personal explana- tion made by the member for Ashley, read to the House the correspondence relating to a proposal made by Mr. Meredith to the Assets Board in regard to the purchase of a por- tion of the Glentui Estate. He produced in this House all the documents relating to the application of Mr. Meredith to the Assets Board. Now, firstly, I wish to ask your ruling upon the question whether the Premier, being a member of the Assets Board, or whether he was a mem- ber of the Assets Board or not, had any right to produce in this House the correspondence of Mr. Meredith with the Assets Board and the decision of the Assets Board in regard to that proposal ? Further, I put to you, Sir, a second question as to whether the papers produced by the honour- able gentleman, being official documents, ought not to be laid on the table of the House. I pro- pose to cite authorities bearing upon the point. Firstly, the Premier referred to the application of Mr. Meredith. I do not speak of Mr. Mere- dith as a member of this House. I speak of him as the private individual-Mr. Meredith. The Premier, referring to the correspondence between Mr. Meredith and the Assets Board, asked the member for Ashley whether he would have any objection to the correspondence being laid on the table. The member for Ashley, speaking from his place in this House, said he had not the slightest objection. The Premier then said " In that case, if the honourable mem- ber would write to the Board stating that he had no objection, he (the Premier) would lay them on the table." Now, Sir, we know what the end of all that will be. The papers will not be laid on the table. There is not the least chance of that being done. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- I want to know whether the honourable member can comment on what has occurred, and prognosticate on what is going to happen, under the pretext of a point of order. The honourable member raised a point of order, and in that he is within his rights ; but the honourable member is com- menting now, and prognosticating what is likely to arise; and in that respect, I say, he is tres- passing and going beyond what is legitimate and right. Mr. DEPUTY-SPEAKER .- I do not think the honourable member has gone beyond what is reasonable or fair in explaining the grounds of his question. Mr. SEDDON .- He has said the return suggested would not be laid on the table. Mr. FISHER .- You have given your ruling. Sir, and I protest against any further interrup- tion. I will not have these interruptions. Then, Sir, I quote the ruling of Mr. Speaker O'Rorke upon the same subject given in this House on 28th July, 18.8. The question having arisen in regard to the production of certain papers by an honourable member, the Hansard record goes on to say :- "Mr. M. J. S. MACKENZIE .- As a point of
