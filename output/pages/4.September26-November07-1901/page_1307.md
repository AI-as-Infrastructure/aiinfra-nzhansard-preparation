Many years ago, when a Bill was pro- mentioned on that side of the House for the posed to give #618,000 in the way of debentures in lieu of land, I asked the House to carry that; last six weeks; and on this Bill, when members and it was objected to at that time by, I think, have the opportunity of referring to the return, they leave it alone-not one of them has Sir Robert Stout and others, and that proposal referred to it. However, I recognise that the Opposition is not an organized Opposition, and they do not want to make things unpleasant an accomplished fact. for the Government. The honourable member also took exception to there being no Blll brought in in connection with the Midland the land-value into debentures or cash was the right thing to have done at the time, and Railway Company debenture-holders. Well, if any one had told me a week ago that the honourable member for Bruce wanted a Bill of Twelve years have now passed, and blocks of the kind, I should have doubted it very much, land in Canterbury, Westland, and Nelson have owing to the action he took on the Public Accounts Committee.

In this matter I have heard have got it. one member saying that unless something is done by the colony for the company it will be a case of " Get you gone ; get more honest men " ; right. I wound up a speech then, and I said and another says the bondholders have laboured under an injustice, and that they must be treated fairly. Now, I have been watching the position narrowly, and with the desire to do what was known as the B1 value, and, as we had said that it was worth £618,000, to simply what was just. The feeling to do something say, " We will give you debentures in lieu of for the debenture-holders and shareholders has come along gradually and slowly, and at last and that the land was of the value we assessed it reached a majority of the Public Accounts Committee, and the one member who was not overshadowed was the honourable member for Wellington City (Mr. Fisher). But I was a little bit surprised this afternoon that he too was anxious that something should be done for the debenture-holders, and that this Mid- land Railway question should be dealt with and the debenture-holders. In conclusion, I once and for all. The question is this: We say those who were in the Ministry when the certainly have come to the conclusion that this project was first mooted and who entered into gift shall be offered.

We were giving them in land full value, and were asking Parliament to give them cash or debentures equal to the land, and I said that the honour of the colony was at stake, and we ought to make that good.
