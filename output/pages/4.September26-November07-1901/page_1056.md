that letter goes before the Board to be dealt with I shall endeavour, as far as I can, to see that the whole of the correspondence in respect to this matter is laid on the table of the House ; but it must be done in the proper way. Mr. FISHER .- The honourable gentleman has Mr. Meredith's letters there in front of him, so there is no difficulty about it. Mr. SEDDON .- The honourable member is wrong. I have not had the letter. Mr. FISHER .- They are underneath. Mr. SEDDON .- The paper I have under- neath is a letter from Mr. Percy Smith, the Government Resident Agent at Niue, which I am going to lay on the table. Mr. MEREDITH .- The Premier has mis- represented me in stating that I produced my private letter to the Assets Board, three years ago, when the question came up on the floor of the House. I had not the papers with me on that occasion. Mr. SEDDON .- I did not say that. I stated that the member for Wakatipu quoted the letters. # MINISTERIAL EXPENSES. Mr. SEDDON (Premier) .- I desire to lay upon the table a return showing the amount drawn by Ministers as salaries and travelling- allowances and expenses. It shows, first, in re- gard to the Premier,- Salary, 1st April, 1900, to 31st £ March, 1901 1,375 16 ..

As it has been stated pub- licly that I have drawn £4,069, I thought it would be interesting to members to know that the amount I drew from this colony, either by way of salary or allowances, was less than £2,000. Add to the £1,913, expenses incurred for steamer and coach fares, which moneys have been paid to those who performed the service, and which I have given in detail, and the total is only $2,259 7s. 10d. That, Sir, is the total cost to the colony last year. The Minister for Railways, who it was stated had drawn in the way of salary and allowances ¥4,000, drew,- Salary, 1st April, 1900, to 31st £ March, 1901 1,113 House allowance, Ist April to 6th June, 1900 . . 36 13 Travelling-allowance 250 10 . . ..

The others do not reside in Government resi- dences, and therefore draw house-allowance. Then, the Minister of Justice received, -- £ s. d.
