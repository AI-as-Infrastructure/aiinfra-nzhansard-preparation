the leading men of England, to say that they will continue to blackmail this colony unless this money is paid to them. I believe this Par- liament will not do that. I believe it to be im- possible. I propose now to refer to some of the charges made against the colony in the peti- tion presented by the debenture-holders to the Stock Exchange while litigation was pending, and while the case between the Government and the debenture-holders was on its passage from the Supreme Court through the Court of Appeal of New Zealand to the Privy Council. They asked the Stock Exchange to refuse to give a quotation for New Zea- land stock ; and all this was being done while the case decided against the debenture- holders was in process of appeal from the Supreme Court of this colony through the Court of Appeal to the Privy Council. It was a direct attempt to coerce the Government. So that they not only petitioned the Stock Exchange with a view of coercing the Govern- ment in the conduct of the litigation, but they openly boasted of having succeeded. Of course, they were mistaken. In the petition they said,- "That, certain questions having arisen be- tween the company and the Government, the matters in dispute were referred to arbitration in the month of November, 1895, but that the debenture-holders took no part in the arbitra- tion proceedings. "That the Government will no doubt seek from time to time to raise further loans in this country for the purpose of railway construc- https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.32106019788261 tion, and in that case would apply to the Stock Exchange, London, for an official quo- tation in respect of such loans. "That the Government have permitted the provisions of the colonial Act to be used as representing that subscribers for debentures created by the company would have the benefit of a first charge upon the railway and every- thing pertaining thereto." The Government had nothing whatever to do with the issue of the debentures, and the people who took them up must have known, or should have contemplated, that the Govern- ment had the powers conferred by the Act of 1881. They must have known of the exist- ence of that Act. The petition to the Stock Exchange goes on to say,- " That it is inexpedient and impolitic in the interests of investors that any Government acting in the manner aforesaid should, in the meantime, be afforded facilities for raising public loans in the money-markets of this country, or that they should receive assist- ance in so doing from your Committee, and your petitioners therefore respectfully urge that the advantage of an official quotation should be withheld from any loans which may be hereafter issued by the Government in this country." The Government of this country had nothing whatever to do with the issue of these deben- tures, and the Agent-General called the petition to the Stock Exchange " an amazing proposal." Mr. Fisher Stock Exchange was that the credit of the colony was greatly injured, and the colony had suf- fered to the extent of Â£400,000. Mr. Bell's address to the Public Accounts Committee (I .- 11, 1900), which is worthy of the atten- tion of every member of the House and of every citizen of this country, shows that the claim has no legitimate foundation. The com- pany boasted of having succeeded in their effort to coerce the Government and in the steps they took to influence the Stock Exchange; and, having used every fair and unfair step to injure this colony, they now appeal to this Parliament as suppliants. The reply one has to combat is that the colony took possession of a line built or constructed by the company. Now I will read that portion of Mr. Bell's address to the Committee which deals with this particular point. It is headed " Part V." of the Public Accounts Committee's report of last year, and is as follows :- "V .- The reply to the claim that, with the money of the company and of the debenture- holders, a part of a public work has been con- structed which has passed to the possession of the Crown, and that the Crown in fairness ought to pay the value of it." Mr. G. W. RUSSELL .- Whom did he appear for ? Mr. FISHER .- For the Government ; and why not ? He goes on to say :- "I now turn to the other class of claim. This claim is founded, as I have already indi- cated, upon the assertion that we have the railway without cost to the colony. They say, ' The company has failed to complete their con- tract, and the debenture-holders have lost their money, and the Government has the railway, and is going to complete it. Therefore you should pay us for the money which we have ex- pended on the line.' Assuming that to be a fair and equitable basis on which to found a claim, the question becomes one for a jury, apart aito- gether from the suggestion that the colony owes any duty of any kind to those people who con- structed the line or to their mortgagees. It is a question of how much this railway is worth to us, having regard to what we have already paid, and to the damage we have suffered through the non-completion of the line. The first question is, what is to be the measure of estimate? As I put it at the commencement of my speech, is it the market-value of the railway, or the sum which it cost them to con- struct it, or the sum which it would have cost the Government to construct it? The measure is, no doubt, to be determined first. Sup- posing the Committee assume that it is neces sary to approach the subject at all, since the colony has only exercised the powers given by the contract, then, no doubt, the Com- mittee will proceed to determine under which of the three heads its estimate should be made. I will deal with each of them. And, first, the market-value appears to be the correct west, because Mr. Coates and the shareholders com- plain that they have been refused their motion for an order, which would have empowered him
