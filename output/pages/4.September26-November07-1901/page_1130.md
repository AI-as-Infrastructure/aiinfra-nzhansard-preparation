Ultimately, of course, things came to an end, and the result was that the Government had to take possession of the line. It is not for me to refer to what was said of the Government and the colony at that time; and, as far as I am concerned, I have forgiven long ago what was said of myself and the Government in respect of our action at that time. I was surprised and pained at the attempt made whilst the matter was before the highest tribunal in the land, the Privy Council, that reference was made and action taken which might reason- ably have been construed as an attempt to create a bias in favour of the debenture-holders. I shall never forget the interview I had in London with the Receiver; and when I stated to him that the company had no legal stand- ing, and that they should at that stage, before having exhausted the whole of their legal remedies, have thrown themselves on the generosity of the colony, I was astonished at the reply-simply astounded-and there was nothing else for it but to allow the law to take its course. It went to the Privy Council, and the Privy Council maintained the colony was in the right, and had acted legally throughout. Mr. ATKINSON .- What was the reply ? Mr. SEDDON .- He told me that he was a Receiver, and he was there to realise; and wanted to know, practically, how much we were prepared to give, and said the sooner we paid the better. In respect to what 4.0. Mr. Fisher has mentioned in the course of his speech, what I take exception to more than anything else was an endeavour made, pending the case being determined, to https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.32106019788261 bring the influence of the Press at Home against the colony. That was unprecedented, unjusti- fiable, and sufficient almost, I think, to prevent subsequently any grant being made to the de- benture-holders or the company. And, again, when the opportunity arose, and this colony was floating a loan, they used their influence against us, and wrote to the Committee of the Stock Exchange, and asked the Stock Ex- change not to quote or register the loans of this colony. I say again, one can scarcely credit that some of the men holding the positions of these gentlemen at Home, who were named by Mr. Fisher, and moving in the highest financial circles, would attempt to do such a thing. The Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, and the Privy Council all gave decisions in favour of the colony. But, more than that, when the matter went to arbitration, which the company themselves favoured and under which we met them as fairly as ever party met party, they were defeated on a claim for damages for a million, the award of the Court being nil ; and in the face of that award of the Court, in the face of the decision of the Supreme Court, in face of the decision of the Appeal Court, and whilst it was pending before the Privy Council, it was not proper for them to take the action they did and endeavour to injure the credit of this colony. The question that will next be asked is, " Why, under the circumstances, should there Mr. Seddon Why do you urge their being generously treated ? " Well, I will give you my reasons why I say something should be given. There are a large number of poor shareholders who invested their money in the first instance; and it is no use blinking the fact, that the gentle- men from this colony who went Home, and placed that venture before the Mother-country, gave too favourable a colour to the project, and under these circumstances many poor per- sons and speculators on the strength of these representations invested their money. The rose colouring was given by the promoters of the company, who carried with them an agree- ment made with the colony. Then, we come to the question of the debenture-holders. The debenture-holders asserted from the first that they advanced the money under the impression that they had a first claim against the assets, and against each section of the whole of the railway line, and a claim as above the colony itself ; they held that the Act of 1884 gave them that right. They were wrong in their interpre- tation of the law, as the decisions of the Courts have proved. Mistakes in law often occur, and they were advised they had first recourse; the reading of the original Act and the Act of 1884 might not unreasonably have led them to the belief that when they advanced the money they had the preference over the Government. On that they, at all events, allege they advanced their moneys in the first instance. Now, as far as the colony is concerned, and to show it was a point in doubt, I will tell the House now that there was that belief in the colony itself, and I understand that two Public Works Ministers were of the same opinion. Mr. J. ALLEN-That the debenture-holders had a prior claim ? Mr. SEDDON .- Yes, in respect to completed sections. Mr. J. ALLEN .- Did Mr. Bell ever advise that? Mr. SEDDON .- I do not answer questions of that kind, because we do not give to the world the opinion of the Crown Law Officers, or that of our legal advisers. But, at all events, it was considered not free from doubt for a time. A change came over the dream ; but I am not going to say who it was who pointed it out, and the result was that the matter was gone fully into, and it was found, as I say, that the con- struction that had been placed upon the Act was not well founded. I will leave it at that. and simply come to the point at issue. As for the view taken by the member for Wellington City, that we should treat the Midland deben- ture-holders and the attorney of the company as we would an ordinary contractor : I say we have had many instances in this colony where persons who have undertaken to make roads for us have failed, and we have called upon the sureties, and we have taken the money of the sureties, and finished the roads, and have not thought fit to give anything in return. I may give you another case in point, that of the Kaihu Valley Railway Company. We advanced - a sum of, I think, Â£46,000, and they spent
