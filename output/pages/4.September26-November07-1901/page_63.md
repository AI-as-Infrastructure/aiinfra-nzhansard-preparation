He had, however, been in- formed that the commanding officer of one company had since told his men that the rest of the money would be required to pay for the straw the men slept on in Christchurch. Such a plea deserved the widest publicity. Alto- gether he considered the administration of the department was a scandal from beginning to end. Mr. SEDDON said, in reply to the member for Palmerston, there had been a standing regulation for years past that unless the men travelled a hundred miles the larger amount was not paid.

And then there was further delay, because, the vouchers having left on the 16th of this month, allowing a couple of days from Dunedin, it took eight days before they reached him, and he had in consequence asked for an explanation. There was no in- tention on his part to delay the payment of this money, and unless the officers sharpened themselves up a little in connection with these matters he would have to look for fresh officers.
