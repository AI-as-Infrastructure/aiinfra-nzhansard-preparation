It was easy enough to see the object of that. It was an attempt to make the Atkinson Administration responsible for a loan raised by the Stout-Vogel Administration. In the eight years of the Seddon Administration the public indebtedness had been increased by £10,333,405, while during the two years when Mr. Ballance was Premier the public debt was only increased by £427,490.
