" Under-Secretary, Mines Department, Wel- lington." " Dunedin, 29th March, 1901. "SIR,-I visited your mine on the 21st instant, while accompanying the Coal-mines Commission, and found that,- "(1.) There was a deficiency in the ventila- tion at the pillar face workings, No. 2 north level, off No. 2 jig, main seam. The air was not conducted to the faces, the stentons were not stopped off, and the air naturally took the nearest route to the return, leaving the working faces unsupplied. The air where Hinks and son and Wilson and Mclellan were working was polluted with black-damp from the waste, the temperature was high, and the men were work- ing under very uncomfortable conditions. " (2.) There was also inadequate ventilation in the new workings which underlie the main seam, and have only recently been opened up. Six men work in the section visited (north side) ; the air was smoky and hot at the face, being almost stagnant. There was so little air current in the intake to this district (stone drive) that I could not obtain a record of move- ment on my anemometer. measured 6,750 cubic feet per minute.

"SIR,-Re my memo. to you of the 29th ulto. : What has been done by the management to remedy the state of the mine at the time (21st ulto.) ; and what are your proposals as to the arrangements for ventilation and second outlet in the future? Please reply at your earliest convenience .- Yours, &c., "E. R. GREEN, Inspector of Mines. "Allan McIntosh, Esq., General Manager, Allendale Coal Company, Shag Point." "Shag Point, 13th April, 1901. "DEAR SIR,-Ke your memo. of the 29th ulto., I handed same to Mr. Gilianders, mine- manager, and thought that he would have re- plied thereto. However, I may inform you that since you were here four men have been em- ployed in the air-course, enlarging it to 4 ft. by 5 ft. in the clear, and expect to have it com- pleted in about a month from date, when I trust it will be to your satisfaction both for an air-course and second outlet .- Yours, &c., "A.
