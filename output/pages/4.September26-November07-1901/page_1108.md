always in the humour. He (Mr. Carroll) would, however, prefer to trust to members of his own party rather than the honourable gentlemen opposite. Mr. HERRIES (Bay of Plenty) wished to make a personal explanation. The Minister had spoken about stonewalling, and alluded to a certain few members who took part in the debate on the previous night. He (Mr. Herries) was one of the members who took part in the debate in Committee, but he could assure the House that there was no stonewalling as far as he was concerned. Mr. CARROLL .- I was not referring to the honourable member. Mr. HERRIE'S said he wished to put that on record, because he would not like his consti- tuents to think that he was stonewalling on Probably there were more this occasion. Maoris in his electoral district than there were in the district of any other member, and therefore it was naturally his desire that good legislation should be passed. That involved on his part, of course, closely watching the passage of these measures, and he wished more members in the House took a keener interest in Native- land legislation. He might say that he and others had simply endeavoured to put this Bill into as workable a shape as possible. Mr. PIRANI (Palmerston) always liked to ac- knowledge a compliment. At the same time he liked it all the better if it were sincere. The Native Minister named four members from the Opposition side of the House whom he said he would like to choose to advise him in regard to Native affairs. But would the House believe that the honourable gentleman had not put one of those members on the Native Affairs Committee, the composition of which he was responsible for ? That being the case, the House would agree that the compliment was an empty one. Notwithstanding that, the Minister was, no doubt, speaking the truth. What he said was what he ought to do, and if the next Native Bill he brought up was scanned by an advisory committee of the four members named, together with the Minister himself, it would be sure to be a good measure. So far as he was con- cerned, he was always in a good humour when the business under consideration was in the public interest as well as in the interests of those it was desirable to benefit. Amendment negatived, and Bill read a third time. # GOVERNMENT RAILWAYS DEPART- MENT CLASSIFICATION BILL. IN COMMITTEE. Clause 19 .- Procedure as to appeals.
