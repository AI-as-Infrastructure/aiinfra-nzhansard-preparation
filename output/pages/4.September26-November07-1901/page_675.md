more important of the works under construc- tion, the principal details of which I will give later on. Before outlining my proposals for expendi- ture I will briefly state the WAYS AND MEANS AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC- WORKS PURPOSES. At 31st March, 1900, the balance of the ways and means of the Public Works Fund amounted to £839,749, and further sums were provided last session, as under :- New loan 1,000,000 Transferred from revenue 500,000 There were also miscellaneous receipts to the amount of £1,787, thus making a gross total of £2,341,536. The expenditure last year amounted to £1,309,021, so that at the close of the year the balance of our ways and means was Class of Work.

The railways under construction were the same as during the previous year, but with two additions - namely, the Stratford-Kawa- kawa and the Heriot Extension lines. The ·expenditure amounted to considerably more than in the previous year-namely, £392,691, against £199,580; the increase being £193,111. The improved progress on all the more import- ant lines has been maintained, especially in the .case of the North Island Main Trunk Railway, so that for several of the principal lines sub- stantial votes must be asked for. I will now briefly describe what has been done on each of the railway-works in hand during the late year, : and also our proposals for the current year. # Kawakawa-Grahamtown. The work on the southern extension of the northern portion of this railway has been con- .tinued, the operations now extending over the the following additional funds :- £ New loan 1,000,000 Further transfer from re- 500,000 venue making altogether a gross total of available ways and means of £2,532,515. The estimates of expenditure for the current year total to £2,197,334 (in addition to £46,577 under the Government Loans to Local Bodies Account), thus leaving an unallocated balance of £335,181. TOTAL PUBLIC WORKS EXPENDITURE. The following table shows the total expendi- ture out of the Public Works Fund on all works and services throughout the colony up to the 31st December, 1890, and also up to the 31st March last, and in a separate column the expenditure during the late financial year :- Expenditure.

Rail- laying has not yet been started, but rails have been procured, so that the work can be put in hand as soon as a sufficient length of formation is available. No suitable ballast has been dis- covered immediately adjacent to the work in hand, but a deposit of scoria-ash exists at a dis- tance of a mile and three-quarters from the line. It will be necessary to construct a branch line to enable this to be utilised. It is expected that the first section of the line will be finished and available for traffic by this time next year. A further link in the northwards extension of the southern portion of the line was completed during the year-namely, the short section of 1 mile 26 chains between Waiotu and Hukerenui -- which was opened for traffic on 1st March last. The survey of the intervening length be- tween the northern and southern portions of this railway has been proceeded with as oppor- tunity offered, the line having been definitely
