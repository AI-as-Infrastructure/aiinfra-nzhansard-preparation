in hand the construction of the line from Heriot towards Edievale. When the work was completed to that point it would be of great benefit to the settlers in the neighbour- hood, and also those living at Roxburgh. He intended to complete the work to Edievale, and the railway was only authorised to that point. He moved the second reading of the Bill. Sir J. G. WARD (Minister for Railways) said, In reply to the question put by the honourable member for Bruce, he did not think an answer could be given to the honour- able member before he returned to the South. The matter would require full and careful con- sideration before it could be taken in hand ; but it was a very good district, and in the future, if it went on developing, would certainly require consideration. Bill read a second and a third time. PUBLIC TRUST OFFICE BILL. IN COMMITTEE. Clause 2 .- "The principal Act is hereby amended as follows :- "(1.)
